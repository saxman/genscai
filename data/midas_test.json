considerable fraction of the general population in the developed world. Concurrently, use of online social media by the same societies has steadily increased over the past two decades. The present study analyzed a recent large country-wide loneliness survey of 20,096 adults in the US using an unsupervised approach for systematic identification of clusters of respondents in terms of their social media use and representation among different socioeconomic subgroups. We studied the underlying population heterogeneity with a computational pipeline that was developed to gain insights into cluster- or group-specific patterns of loneliness. In particular, distributions of high loneliness were observed in groups of female users of Facebook and YouTube of certain age, race, marital, and socioeconomic status. For instance, among the group of predominantly YouTube users, we noted that non-Hispanic white female respondents of age 25-44 years who have high school or less education level and are single or never married have more significant high loneliness distribution. In fact, their high loneliness scores also seem to be associated with self-reported poorer physical and mental health outcomes.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007\/s41347-021-00208-4.","1":"The tetravalent dengue vaccine CYD-TDV (Dengvaxia) is the first licensed vaccine against dengue, but recent findings indicate an elevated risk of severe disease among vaccinees without prior dengue virus (DENV) exposure.

Our objective was to evaluate the potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of vaccination following serological screening. To do so, we used an agent-based model to simulate DENV transmission with and without vaccination over a 10-year timeframe. Across a range of values for the proportion of vaccinees with prior DENV exposure, we projected the proportion of symptomatic and hospitalized cases averted as a function of the sensitivity and specificity of serological screening. Scenarios about the cost-effectiveness of screening and vaccination were chosen to be representative of Brazil and the Philippines. We found that public health impact depended primarily on sensitivity in high-transmission settings and on specificity in low-transmission settings. Cost-effectiveness could be achievable from the perspective of a public payer provided that sensitivity and the value of a disability-adjusted life-year were both high, but only in high-transmission settings. Requirements for reducing relative risk and achieving cost-effectiveness from an individual perspective were more restricted, due to the fact that those who test negative pay for screening but receive no benefit. Our results predict that cost-effectiveness could be achieved only in high-transmission areas of dengue-endemic countries with a relatively high per capita GDP, such as Panam\u00e1 (13,680 USD), Brazil (8,649 USD), M\u00e9xico (8,201 USD), or Thailand (5,807 USD). In conclusion, vaccination with CYD-TDV following serological screening could have a positive impact in some high-transmission settings, provided that screening is highly specific (to minimize individual harm), at least moderately sensitive (to maximize population benefit), and sufficiently inexpensive (depending on the setting).","2":"Several tolerance checkpoints exist throughout B cell development to control autoreactive B cells and prevent the generation of pathogenic autoantibodies. Fc\u03b3RIIb is an Fc receptor that inhibits B cell activation and, if defective, is associated with autoimmune disease, yet its impact on specific B cell tolerance checkpoints is unknown. Here we show that reduced expression of Fc\u03b3RIIb enhances the deletion and anergy of autoreactive immature B cells, but in contrast promotes autoreactive B cell expansion in the germinal center and serum autoantibody production, even in response to exogenous, non-self antigens. Our data thus show that Fc\u03b3RIIb has opposing effects on pre-immune and post-immune tolerance checkpoints, and suggest that B cell tolerance requires the control of bystander germinal center B cells with low or no affinity for the immunizing antigen.","3":"Historically, many diseases have been named after the species or location of discovery, the discovering scientists, or the most impacted population. However, species-specific disease names often misrepresent the true reservoir; location-based disease names are frequently targeted with xenophobia; some of the discovering scientists have darker histories; and impacted populations have been stigmatized for this association. Acknowledging these concerns, the World Health Organization now proposes naming diseases after their causative pathogen or symptomatology. Recently, this guidance has been retrospectively applied to a disease at the center of an outbreak rife with stigmatization and misinformation: mpox (f.k.a. 'monkeypox'). This disease, historically endemic to west and central Africa, has prompted racist remarks as it spread globally in 2022 in an epidemic ongoing today. Moreover, its elevated prevalence among men who have sex with men has yielded increased stigma against the LGBTQ+ community. To address these prejudicial associations, 'monkeypox' was renamed 'mpox' in November 2022. We used publicly available data from Google Search Trends to determine which countries were quicker to adopt this name change-and understand factors that limit or facilitate its use. Specifically, we built regression models to quantify the relationship between 'mpox' search intensity in a given country and the country's type of political regime, robustness of sociopolitical and health systems, level of pandemic preparedness, extent of gender and educational inequalities, and temporal evolution of mpox cases through December 2023. Our results suggest that, when compared to 'monkeypox' search intensity, 'mpox' search intensity was significantly higher in countries with any history of mpox outbreaks or higher levels of LGBTQ+ acceptance; meanwhile, 'mpox' search intensity was significantly lower in countries governed by leaders who had recently propagated infectious disease misinformation. Among infectious diseases with stigmatizing names, mpox is among the first to be revised retrospectively. While the adoption of a given disease name will be context-specific-depending in part on its origins and the affected subpopulations-our study provides generalizable insights, applicable to future changes in disease nomenclature.","4":"The rate of resistance to piperacillin\/tazobactam in K. pneumoniae increased significantly over the study period and was significantly correlated with BLBLI consumption. While BLBLIs can potentially be utilized as an alternative to carbapenems, our findings reinforce concerns of resistance to these drugs. Further research is needed to understand the implications on resistance of utilizing BLBLIs as a carbapenem-sparing option.The rate of resistance to piperacillin\/tazobactam in K. pneumoniae significantly increased over the study period (p\u2009<\u20090.01). The consumption of all BLBLIs was also found to be significantly correlated with the rate of resistance to piperacillin\/tazobactam (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.66; p\u2009<\u20090.01), ceftazidime (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.54; p\u2009=\u20090.02), and levofloxacin (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.60; p\u2009=\u20090.01) with two-quarter lags. Furthermore, the consumption of all third-generation cephalosporins was significantly correlated with rates of K. pneumoniae resistance to ceftazidime (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.64; p\u2009<\u20090.01) with a two-quarter lag and levofloxacin (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.50; p\u2009=\u20090.03) with a quarter lag. The consumption of all fluoroquinolones correlated with resistance rates to ceftazidime (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.14; p\u2009<\u20090.01) with a two-quarter lag.\u03b2-Lactam\/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors (BLBLIs) were introduced into clinical practice as an alternative to carbapenems for treating multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infections. However, little is known about the relationship between BLBLI treatment and antimicrobial resistance. In this study, we investigated the trends and the temporal association between antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance in K. pneumoniae isolates obtained between 2012 and 2016.Data regarding quarterly consumption (total number of prescriptions per quarter) of all BLBLIs, all third-generation cephalosporins, and all fluoroquinolones at a tertiary care hospital were obtained from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. Susceptibility data (isolation rate of antibiotic resistance per quarter) were obtained from the existing database of the same tertiary hospital. Regression analysis was used to analyze annual trends and cross-correlations to assess the temporal association on a quarterly basis between antibiotic consumption and antibiotic resistance in K. pneumoniae.","5":"Airborne pathogens - either transmitted via aerosol or droplets - include a wide variety of highly infectious and dangerous microbes such as variola virus, measles virus, influenza A viruses, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis. Emerging zoonotic pathogens, for example, MERS coronavirus, avian influenza viruses, Coxiella, and Francisella, would have pandemic potential were they to acquire efficient human-to-human transmissibility. Here, we synthesize insights from microbiological, medical, social, and economic sciences to provide known mechanisms of aerosolized transmissibility and identify knowledge gaps that limit emergency preparedness plans. In particular, we propose a framework of drivers facilitating human-to-human transmission with the airspace between individuals as an intermediate stage. The model is expected to enhance identification and risk assessment of novel pathogens.","6":"For an epidemic with a reproductive rate (R0) of 1.30, adding pharmacies with typical business hours averted 11.9 million symptomatic influenza cases, 23,577 to 94,307 deaths, $1.0 billion in direct (vaccine administration and healthcare) costs, $4.2-44.4 billion in productivity losses, and $5.2-45.3 billion in overall costs (varying with mortality rate). Increasing the epidemic severity (R0 of 1.63), averted 16.0 million symptomatic influenza cases, 35,407 to 141,625 deaths, $1.9 billion in direct costs, $6.0-65.5 billion in productivity losses, and $7.8-67.3 billion in overall costs (varying with mortality rate). Extending pharmacy hours averted up to 16.5 million symptomatic influenza cases, 145,278 deaths, $1.9 billion direct costs, $4.1 billion in productivity loss, and $69.5 billion in overall costs. Adding pharmacies resulted in a cost-benefit of $4.1 to $11.5 billion, varying epidemic severity, mortality rate, pharmacy hours, location vaccination rate, and delay in the availability of the vaccine.We utilized an agent-based model of the US and a clinical and economics outcomes model to simulate the impact of different influenza epidemics and the impact of utilizing pharmacies in addition to traditional (hospitals, clinic\/physician offices, and urgent care centers) locations for vaccination for the year 2017.Administering vaccines through pharmacies in addition to traditional locations in the event of an epidemic can increase vaccination coverage, mitigating up to 23.7 million symptomatic influenza cases, providing cost-savings up to $2.8 billion to third-party payers and $99.8 billion to society. Pharmacies should be considered as points of dispensing epidemic vaccines in addition to traditional settings as soon as vaccines become available.During an influenza epidemic, where early vaccination is crucial, pharmacies may be a resource to increase vaccine distribution reach and capacity.","7":"BackgroundTick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a disease which can lead to severe neurological symptoms, caused by the TBE virus (TBEV). The natural transmission cycle occurs in foci and involves ticks as vectors and several key hosts that act as reservoirs and amplifiers of the infection spread. Recently, the incidence of TBE in Europe has been rising in both endemic and new regions.AimIn this study we want to provide comprehensive understanding of the main ecological and environmental factors that affect TBE spread across Europe.MethodsWe searched available literature on covariates linked with the circulation of TBEV in Europe. We then assessed the best predictors for TBE incidence in 11 European countries by means of statistical regression, using data on human infections provided by the European Surveillance System (TESSy), averaged between 2017 and 2021.ResultsWe retrieved data from 62 full-text articles and identified 31 different covariates associated with TBE occurrence. Finally, we selected eight variables from the best model, including factors linked to vegetation cover, climate, and the presence of tick hosts.DiscussionThe existing literature is heterogeneous, both in study design and covariate types. Here, we summarised and statistically validated the covariates affecting the variability of TBEV across Europe. The analysis of the factors enhancing disease emergence is a fundamental step towards the identification of potential hotspots of viral circulation. Hence, our results can support modelling efforts to estimate the risk of TBEV infections and help decision-makers implement surveillance and prevention campaigns.","8":"Mathematical models predict an exponential distribution of infection prevalence across communities where a disease is disappearing. Trachoma control programs offer an opportunity to test this hypothesis, as the World Health Organization has targeted trachoma for elimination as a public health concern by the year 2020. Local programs may benefit if a single survey could reveal whether infection was headed towards elimination. Using data from a previously-published 2009 survey, we test the hypothesis that Chlamydia trachomatis prevalence across 75 Tanzanian communities where trachoma had been documented to be disappearing is exponentially distributed.We fit multiple continuous distributions to the Tanzanian data and found the exponential gave the best approximation. Model selection by Akaike Information Criteria (AICc) suggested the exponential distribution had the most parsimonious fit to the data. Those distributions which do not include the exponential as a special or limiting case had much lower likelihoods of fitting the observed data. 95% confidence intervals for shape parameter estimates of those distributions which do include the exponential as a special or limiting case were consistent with the exponential. Lastly, goodness-of-fit testing was unable to reject the hypothesis that the prevalence data came from an exponential distribution.Models correctly predict that infection prevalence across communities where a disease is disappearing is best described by an exponential distribution. In Tanzanian communities where local control efforts had reduced the clinical signs of trachoma by 80% over 10 years, an exponential distribution gave the best fit to prevalence data. An exponential distribution has a relatively heavy tail, thus occasional high-prevalence communities are to be expected even when infection is disappearing. A single cross-sectional survey may be able to reveal whether elimination efforts are on-track.","9":"Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, can be used to treat cytokine release syndrome (CRS), with observed improvements in a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case series.Among the 239 patients, median age was 64 years; 36%\u00a0and 19%\u00a0were black and Hispanic, respectively. Hospital census increased exponentially, yet MV census did not. Severe disease was associated with lower survival (78%\u00a0vs\u00a093%; P\u00a0< .001), greater proportion requiring MV (44%\u00a0vs\u00a05%; P\u00a0< .001), and longer median MV days (5.5 vs\u00a01.0; P\u00a0= .003). Tocilizumab-treated patients (n\u00a0= 153 [64%]) comprised 90%\u00a0of those with severe disease; 44%\u00a0of patients with nonsevere disease received tocilizumab for evolving CRS. Tocilizumab-treated patients with severe disease had higher admission levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (120 vs\u00a071\u00a0mg\/L; P\u00a0< .001) and received tocilizumab sooner (2 vs\u00a03\u00a0days; P\u00a0< .001), but their survival was similar to that of patients with nonsevere disease (83%\u00a0vs\u00a091%; P\u00a0= .11). For tocilizumab-treated patients requiring MV, survival was 75%\u00a0(95%\u00a0CI, 64-89). Following tocilizumab treatment, few adverse events occurred, and oxygenation and inflammatory biomarkers (eg, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, IL-6) improved; however, D-dimer and soluble IL-2 receptor (also termed CD25) levels increased significantly. Survival in black and Hispanic patients, after controlling for age, was significantly higher than in white patients (log-rank test, P\u00a0= .002).The goal of this study was to determine if tocilizumab benefits patients hospitalized with COVID-19.A treatment algorithm that included tocilizumab to target CRS may influence MV and survival outcomes. In tocilizumab-treated patients, oxygenation and inflammatory biomarkers improved, with higher than expected survival. Randomized trials must confirm these findings.This observational study of consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalized between March 10, 2020, and March 31, 2020, and followed up through April 21, 2020, was conducted by chart review. Patients were treated with tocilizumab using an algorithm that targeted CRS. Survival and mechanical ventilation (MV) outcomes were reported for 14\u00a0days and stratified according to disease severity designated at admission (severe,\u00a0\u2265 3\u00a0L supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation > 93%). For tocilizumab-treated patients, pre\/post analyses of clinical response, biomarkers, and safety outcomes were assessed. Post hoc survival analyses were conducted for race\/ethnicity.","10":"There is increasing appreciation that latrine access does not imply use-many individuals who own latrines do not consistently use them. Little is known, however, about the determinants of latrine use, particularly among those with variable defecation behaviors. Using the integrated behavior model of water, sanitation, and hygiene framework, we sought to characterize determinants of latrine use in rural Ecuador. We interviewed 197 adults living in three communities with a survey consisting of 70 psychosocial defecation-related questions. Questions were excluded from analysis if responses lacked variability or at least 10% of respondents did not provide a definitive answer. All interviewed individuals had access to a privately owned or shared latrine. We then applied adaptive elastic nets (ENET) and supervised principal component analysis (SPCA) to a reduced dataset of 45 questions among 154 individuals with complete data to select determinants that predict self-reported latrine use. Latrine use was common, but not universal, in the sample (76%). The SPCA model identified six determinants and adaptive ENET selected five determinants. Three indicators were represented in both models-latrine users were more likely to report that their latrine is clean enough to use and also more likely to report daily latrine use; while those reporting that elderly men were not latrine users were less likely to use latrines themselves. Our findings suggest that social norms are important predictors of latrine use, whereas knowledge of the health benefits of sanitation may not be as important. These determinants are informative for promotion of latrine adoption.","11":"Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines target 10 or 13 specific serotypes. To evaluate the overall efficacy of these products, the vaccine-targeted serotypes are typically aggregated into a single group. However, it is often desirable to evaluate variations in effects for different serotypes. These serotype-specific estimates are often based on small counts, resulting in a high degree of uncertainty (i.e., large standard errors and wide confidence intervals). An alternative is to use a hierarchical Bayesian statistical model, which estimates overall effectiveness while simultaneously providing estimates of serotype-specific vaccine effects. These shrunken serotype-specific estimators often have smaller mean squared errors (MSEs) than unbiased versions due to a large decrease in posterior uncertainty. We re-analyzed published data from a randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of PCV13 against community-acquired pneumonia caused by vaccine-targeted serotype using a hierarchical model. This model provides a potential framework for obtaining estimates of serotype-specific vaccine effects with reduced MSEs.","12":"The trial is expected to provide the first high-quality evidence of the comparative efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the two topical treatments in current use, as well as investigate the potential benefit of HPV vaccination, in the management of anogenital warts.To investigate the efficacy of clearance and prevention of recurrence of external anogenital warts by topical treatments, podophyllotoxin 0.15% cream or imiquimod 5% cream, in combination with a three-dose regimen of qHPV or control vaccination. 500 adult patients presenting with external anogenital warts with either a first or subsequent episode of anogenital warts will be entered into this randomised, controlled partially blinded 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 factorial trial.Anogenital warts are the second most common sexually transmitted infection diagnosed in sexual health services in England. About 90% of genital warts are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 or 11, and half of episodes diagnosed are recurrences. The best and most cost-effective treatment for patients with anogenital warts is unknown. The commonly used treatments are self-administered topical agents, podophyllotoxin (0.15% cream) or imiquimod (5% cream), or cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen. Quadrivalent HPV (qHPV) vaccination is effective in preventing infection, and disease, but whether it has any therapeutic effect is not known.The trial was registered prior to starting recruitment under the following reference numbers: International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) Registry - ISRCTN32729817 (registered 25 July 2014); European Union Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT) - 2013-002951-14 (registered 26 June 2013).","13":"Establish a framework by which experts define disease subsets in systemic sclerosis associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD).Forty-four experts (53%) completed the survey. Consensus was achieved on the dimensions of severity (75%, 60 of 80 profiles), risk of progression (71%, 57 of 80 profiles) and progressive ILD (60%, 24 of 40 profiles). For profiles achieving consensus, most were classified as clinical ILD (92%), low risk (54%), and stable (71%). Severity and disease progression overlapped in terms of framework items that were most influential in classifying patients (forced vital capacity, extent of lung involvement on high resolution chest CT (HRCT)); risk of progression was influenced primarily by disease duration.Using our proposed conceptual framework, international experts were able to achieve a consensus on classifying SSc-ILD patients along the dimensions of disease severity, risk of progression, and progression over time. Experts rely on similar items when classifying disease severity and progression: a combination of spirometry and gas exchange and quantitative HRCT.A conceptual framework for subclinical, clinical, and progressive ILD was provided to eighty-three experts, asking them to use the framework and classify actual SSc-ILD patients. Each patient profile was designed to be classified by at least 4 experts in terms of severity and risk of progression at baseline; progression was based on 1-year follow-up data. A consensus was reached if\u2009\u2265\u200975% of experts agreed. Experts provided information on which items were important in determining classification.","14":"We collected data on practice characteristics, provider sociodemographics, and attitudes and beliefs about hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), opioid use, and IDU via online survey. Providers in 8 counties of western NC were invited to participate by email. Results were analyzed using descriptive and bivariate statistics.Our findings provide insights to inform health infrastructure improvement, with the goal of preventing HCV or HIV outbreaks in southern Appalachia. Rural health care workers are willing to receive additional training if it can improve care for patients affected by substance use disorders.Of 84 respondents participating between 30 July and 3 December 2018, 81% were practicing clinicians and 46% served a county identified as being vulnerable to IDU-associated outbreaks of HCV or HIV. A substantial proportion was unsure about injecting behaviors among patients. Scores reflected comfort working with opioid users, though this varied by medical specialty. One-quarter of respondents \"never\" discussed harm reduction or HCV treatment with patients known to inject drugs; 22% \"never\" discussed HIV screening with injectors; and 1 in 3 referred at-risk patients out for HCV or HIV testing rather than ordering a test themselves. Scores indicated low levels of stigma toward persons living with HCV or HIV. Respondents identified HIV treatment, HCV treatment, and liver disease management as training needs.To characterize how health care providers in western North Carolina (NC) manage patients with substance use disorders and to inform strategies for preventing injection drug use (IDU)-associated outbreaks of bloodborne infectious diseases.","15":"Potential index participants are screened for intimate partner violence (IPV) and those at high risk are not eligible to enrol. Those at medium risk are monitored for IPV following enrolment. A community advisory board engages in feedback and discussion between the community and the research team. A safety monitoring board discusses study progress and reviews data, including IPV monitoring data. Dissemination plans include presentations at quarterly Ministry of Health meetings, local and international conferences and publications.NCT03447210, Pre-results stage.This prospective cohort study leverages a network of PEs to identify 1000 HIV-positive PWID for enrolment as index participants. Each index completes a questionnaire and provides names and contact information of all sexual and injecting partners during the previous 3 years. PEs then use a stepwise locator protocol to engage partners in the community and bring them to study sites for enrolment, questionnaire completion and rapid HIV and HCV testing. Outcomes include number and type of partners per index who are mentioned, enrolled, tested, diagnosed with HIV and HCV and linked to care.Targeted, tailored interventions to test high-risk individuals for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are vital to achieving HIV control and HCV microelimination in Africa. Compared with the general population, people who inject drugs (PWID) are at increased risk of HIV and HCV and are less likely to be tested or successfully treated. Assisted partner services (APS) increases HIV testing among partners of people living with HIV and improves case finding and linkage to care. We describe a study in Kenya examining whether APS can be adapted to find, test and link to HIV care the partners of HIV-positive PWID using a network of community-embedded peer educators (PEs). Our study also identifies HCV-positive partners and uses phylogenetic analysis to determine risk factors for onward transmission of both viruses.","16":"Emerging and re-emerging pathogens exhibit very complex dynamics, are hard to model and difficult to predict. Their dynamics might appear intractable. However, new statistical approaches-rooted in dynamical systems and the theory of stochastic processes-have yielded insight into the dynamics of emerging and re-emerging pathogens. We argue that these approaches may lead to new methods for predicting epidemics. This perspective views pathogen emergence and re-emergence as a \"critical transition,\" and uses the concept of noisy dynamic bifurcation to understand the relationship between the system observables and the distance to this transition. Because the system dynamics exhibit characteristic fluctuations in response to perturbations for a system in the vicinity of a critical point, we propose this information may be harnessed to develop early warning signals. Specifically, the motion of perturbations slows as the system approaches the transition.","17":"Here, we take advantage of the accrued, publicly available data, as well as two newly sequenced pre-epidemic historical isolates from 1996, and a very early diverging ACME-negative NAE genome, to understand the pre-epidemic evolution of USA300. We use database mining techniques to emphasize genomes similar to pre-epidemic isolates, with the goal of reconstructing the early molecular evolution of the USA300 lineage.USA300 has remained the dominant community and healthcare associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clone in the United States and in northern South America for at least the past 20 years. In this time, it has experienced epidemic spread in both of these locations. However, its pre-epidemic evolutionary history and origins are incompletely understood. Large sequencing databases, such as NCBI, PATRIC, and Staphopia, contain clues to the early evolution of USA300 in the form of sequenced genomes of USA300 isolates that are representative of lineages that diverged prior to the establishment of the South American epidemic (SAE) clade and North American epidemic (NAE) clade. In addition, historical isolates collected prior to the emergence of epidemics can help reconstruct early events in the history of this lineage.Phylogenetic analysis with these genomes confirms that the NAE and SAE USA300 lineages diverged from a most recent common ancestor around 1970 with high confidence, and it also pinpoints the independent acquisition events of the of the ACME and COMER loci with greater precision than in previous studies. We provide evidence for a North American origin of the USA300 lineage and identify multiple introductions of USA300 into South and North America. Notably, we describe a third major USA300 clade (the pre-epidemic branching clade; PEB1) consisting of both MSSA and MRSA isolates circulating around the world that diverged from the USA300 lineage prior to the establishment of the South and North American epidemics. We present a detailed analysis of specific sequence characteristics of each of the major clades, and present diagnostic positions that can be used to classify new genomes.","18":"With the likely move to decreased cost-effectiveness thresholds, reassessment of existing risk group-based vaccine programme cost-effectiveness in the presence of the paediatric vaccination programme is needed.For this cost-effectiveness analysis, we used a transmission model of seasonal influenza calibrated to 14 seasons of weekly consultation and virology data in England and Wales. We combined this model with an economic evaluation to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, measured in cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained.In 2013 England and Wales began to fund a live attenuated influenza vaccine programme for individuals aged 2-16 years. Mathematical modelling predicts substantial beneficial herd effects for the entire population as a result of reduced influenza transmission. With a decreased influenza-associated disease burden, existing immunisation programmes might be less cost-effective. The aim of this study was to assess the epidemiological effect and cost-effectiveness of the existing elderly and risk group vaccination programme under the new policy of mass paediatric vaccination in England.Our results suggest that well timed administration of paediatric vaccination would reduce the number of low-risk elderly influenza cases to a greater extent than would vaccination of the low-risk elderly themselves if the elderly uptake is achieved more slowly. Although high-risk vaccination remains cost-effective, substantial uncertainty exists as to whether low-risk elderly vaccination remains cost-effective, driven by the choice of cost-effectiveness threshold. Under base case assumptions and a cost-effectiveness threshold of \u00a315\u2008000 per QALY, the low-risk elderly seasonal vaccination programme will cease to be cost-effective with a mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of \u00a322\u2008000 per QALY and a probability of cost-effectiveness of 20%. However, under a \u00a330\u2008000 per QALY threshold, the programme will remain cost-effective with 83% probability.National Institute for Health Research, the Medical Research Council.","19":"Various forms of preventive and prophylactic antimicrobial therapies have been proposed to combat HIV (e.g. pre-exposure prophylaxis), tuberculosis (e.g. isoniazid preventive therapy) and malaria (e.g. intermittent preventive treatment). However, the potential population-level effects of preventative therapy (PT) on the prevalence of drug resistance are not well understood. PT can directly affect the rate at which resistance is acquired among those receiving PT. It can also indirectly affect resistance by altering the rate at which resistance is acquired through treatment for active disease and by modifying the level of competition between transmission of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive pathogens. We propose a general mathematical model to explore the ways in which PT can affect the long-term prevalence of drug resistance. Depending on the relative contributions of these three mechanisms, we find that increasing the level of coverage of PT may result in increases, decreases or non-monotonic changes in the overall prevalence of drug resistance. These results demonstrate the complexity of the relationship between PT and drug resistance in the population. Care should be taken when predicting population-level changes in drug resistance from small pilot studies of PT or estimates based solely on its direct effects. ","20":"The lack of an identifiable intermediate host species for the proximal animal ancestor of SARS-CoV-2, and the large geographical distance between Wuhan and where the closest evolutionary related coronaviruses circulating in horseshoe bats (members of the Sarbecovirus subgenus) have been identified, is fuelling speculation on the natural origins of SARS-CoV-2. We performed a comprehensive phylogenetic study on SARS-CoV-2 and all the related bat and pangolin sarbecoviruses sampled so far. Determining the likely recombination events reveals a highly reticulate evolutionary history within this group of coronaviruses. Distribution of the inferred recombination events is non-random with evidence that Spike, the main target for humoral immunity, is beside a recombination hotspot likely driving antigenic shift events in the ancestry of bat sarbecoviruses. Coupled with the geographic ranges of their hosts and the sampling locations, across southern China, and into Southeast Asia, we confirm that horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus, are the likely reservoir species for the SARS-CoV-2 progenitor. By tracing the recombinant sequence patterns, we conclude that there has been relatively recent geographic movement and co-circulation of these viruses' ancestors, extending across their bat host ranges in China and Southeast Asia over the last 100\u2009years. We confirm that a direct proximal ancestor to SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been sampled, since the closest known relatives collected in Yunnan shared a common ancestor with SARS-CoV-2 approximately 40\u2009years ago. Our analysis highlights the need for dramatically more wildlife sampling to (i) pinpoint the exact origins of SARS-CoV-2's animal progenitor, (ii) the intermediate species that facilitated transmission from bats to humans (if there is one), and (iii) survey the extent of the diversity in the related sarbecoviruses' phylogeny that present high risk for future spillovers.","21":"Estimates of the global health impact of immunisation are important for quantifying historical benefits as well as planning future investments and strategy. The Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium (VIMC) was established in 2016 to provide reliable estimates of the health impact of immunisation. In this article we examine the consortium in its first five-year phase. We detail how vaccine impact was defined and the methods used to estimate it as well as the technical infrastructure required to underpin robust reproducibility of the outputs. We highlight some of the applications of estimates to date, how these were communicated and what their effect were. Finally, we explore some of the lessons learnt and remaining challenges for estimating the impact of vaccines and forming effective modelling consortia then discuss how this may be addressed in the second phase of VIMC. Modelled estimates are not a replacement for surveillance; however, they can examine theoretical counterfactuals and highlight data gaps to complement other activities. VIMC has implemented strategies to produce robust, standardised estimates of immunisation impact. But through the first phase of the consortium, critical lessons have been learnt both on the technical infrastructure and the effective engagement with modellers and stakeholders. To be successful, a productive dialogue with estimate consumers, producers and stakeholders needs to be underpinned by a rigorous and transparent analytical framework as well as an approach for building expertise in the short and long term.","22":"Ignoring how the observed incidences depend on the indirect effects achieved with a particular vaccine may lead to repeated changes in vaccines at successive reevaluations, with unintended resurgences, economic inefficiencies, and eroding vaccine confidence. We propose internalizing indirect effects to prevent vaccines falling victim to their own success.Incremental cost-effectiveness analyses may inform the optimal choice of healthcare interventions. Nevertheless, for many vaccines, benefits fluctuate with incidence levels over time. Reevaluating a vaccine after it has successfully decreased incidences may eventually cause a disease resurgence if switching to a vaccine with lower indirect benefits. Decisions may successively alternate between vaccines alongside repeated rises and falls in incidence and when indirect effects from historic use are ignored. Our suggested proposal aims to prevent suboptimal decision making.We used a conceptual model of demand to illustrate alternating decisions between vaccines because of time-varying levels of indirect effects. Similar to the concept of subsidies, we propose internalizing the indirect effects achievable with vaccines. In a case study over 60 years, we simulated a hypothetical 10-year reevaluation of 2 oncogenic human papillomavirus vaccines, of which only 1 protects additionally against anogenital warts.Our case study showed that the vaccine with additional warts protection is initially valued higher than the vaccine without additional warts protection. After 10 years, this differential decreases because of declines in warts incidence, which supports switching to the nonwarts vaccine that causes a warts resurgence eventually. Instead, pricing the indirect effects separately supports continuing with the warts vaccine.","23":"The average spatial distance between transmission-linked cases is a fundamental property of infectious disease dispersal. However, the distance between a case and their infector is rarely measurable. Contact-tracing investigations are resource intensive or even impossible, particularly when only a subset of cases are detected. Here, we developed an approach that uses onset dates, the generation time distribution and location information to estimate the mean transmission distance. We tested our method using outbreak simulations. We then applied it to the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak in Cumbria, UK, and compared our results to contact-tracing activities. In simulations with a true mean distance of 106m, the average mean distance estimated was 109m when cases were fully observed (95% range of 71-142). Estimates remained consistent with the true mean distance when only five percent of cases were observed, (average estimate of 128m, 95% range 87-165). Estimates were robust to spatial heterogeneity in the underlying population. We estimated that both the mean and the standard deviation of the transmission distance during the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak was 8.9km (95% CI: 8.4km-9.7km). Contact-tracing activities found similar values of 6.3km (5.2km-7.4km) and 11.2km (9.5km-12.8km), respectively. We were also able to capture the drop in mean transmission distance over the course of the outbreak. Our approach is applicable across diseases, robust to under-reporting and can inform interventions and surveillance.","24":", larger canopy and increased shoot biomass) may help mitigate weed control, but the underlying genetics of these traits in carrot is unknown. This project used a diallel mating design coupled with recent Bayesian analytical methods to determine the genetic basis of carrot shoot growth. Six diverse carrot inbred lines with variable shoot size were crossed in WI in 2014. F1 hybrids, reciprocal crosses, and parental selfs were grown in a randomized complete block design with two blocks in WI (2015) and CA (2015, 2016). Measurements included canopy height, canopy width, shoot biomass, and root biomass. General and specific combining abilities were estimated using Griffing's Model\u00a0I, which is a common analysis for plant breeding experiments. In parallel, additive, inbred, cross-specific, and maternal effects were estimated from a Bayesian mixed model, which is robust to dealing with data imbalance and outliers. Both additive and nonadditive effects significantly influenced shoot traits, with nonadditive effects playing a larger role early in the growing season, when weed control is most critical. Results suggest the presence of heritable variation and thus potential for improvement of these phenotypes in carrot. In addition, results present evidence of heterosis for root biomass, which is a major component of carrot yield.","25":"Klebsiella pneumoniae causes community- and healthcare-associated infections in children and adults. Globally in 2019, an estimated 1.27 million (95% Uncertainty Interval [UI]: 0.91-1.71) and 4.95 million (95% UI: 3.62-6.57) deaths were attributed to and associated with bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR), respectively. K. pneumoniae was the second leading pathogen in deaths attributed to AMR resistant bacteria. Furthermore, the rise of antimicrobial resistance in both community- and hospital-acquired infections is a concern for neonates and infants who are at high risk for invasive bacterial disease. There is a limited antibiotic pipeline for new antibiotics to treat multidrug resistant infections, and vaccines targeted against K. pneumoniae are considered to be of priority by the World Health Organization. Vaccination of pregnant women against K. pneumoniae could reduce the risk of invasive K.pneumoniae disease in their young offspring. In addition, vulnerable children, adolescents and adult populations at risk of K. pneumoniae disease with underlying diseases such as immunosuppression from underlying hematologic malignancy, chemotherapy, patients undergoing abdominal and\/or urinary surgical procedures, or prolonged intensive care management are also potential target groups for a K. pneumoniae vaccine. A 'Vaccine Value Profile' (VVP) for K.pneumoniae, which contemplates vaccination of pregnant women to protect their babies from birth through to at least three months of age and other high-risk populations, provides a high-level, holistic assessment of the available information to inform the potential public health, economic and societal value of a pipeline of K. pneumoniae vaccines and other preventatives and therapeutics. This VVP was developed by a working group of subject matter experts from academia, non-profit organizations, public-private partnerships, and multi-lateral organizations, and in collaboration with stakeholders from the WHO. All contributors have extensive expertise on various elements of the K.pneumoniae VVP and collectively aimed to identify current research and knowledge gaps. The VVP was developed using only existing and publicly available information.","26":"Building on previous multicountry surveillance studies of typhoid and others salmonelloses such as the Diseases of the Most Impoverished program and the Typhoid Surveillance in Africa Project, several ongoing blood culture surveillance studies are generating important data about incidence, severity, transmission, and clinical features of invasive Salmonella infections in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. These studies are also characterizing drug resistance patterns in their respective study sites. Each study answers a different set of research questions and employs slightly different methodologies, and the geographies under surveillance differ in size, population density, physician practices, access to healthcare facilities, and access to microbiologically safe water and improved sanitation. These differences in part reflect the heterogeneity of the epidemiology of invasive salmonellosis globally, and thus enable generation of data that are useful to policymakers in decision-making for the introduction of typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs). Moreover, each study is evaluating the large-scale deployment of TCVs, and may ultimately be used to assess post-introduction vaccine impact. The data generated by these studies will also be used to refine global disease burden estimates. It is important to ensure that lessons learned from these studies not only inform vaccination policy, but also are incorporated into sustainable, low-cost, integrated vaccine-preventable disease surveillance systems.","27":"Vaccine effectiveness estimates under a cohort design with explicit target trial emulation and a test-negative design were similar when using rich information from the VA healthcare system, but diverged in opposite directions when using a limited dataset. In settings like ours with sufficient information on confounders and other key variables, the cohort design with explicit target trial emulation may be preferable as a principled approach that allows estimation of absolute risks and facilitates interpretation of effect estimates.We compared the cohort and test-negative designs to estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine against Covid-19 outcomes using nationwide data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Specifically, we (1) explicitly emulated a target trial using follow-up data and evaluated the potential for confounding using negative controls and benchmarking to a randomized trial, (2) performed case-control sampling of the cohort to confirm empirically that the same estimate is obtained, (3) further restricted the sampling to person-days with a test, and (4) implemented additional features of a test-negative design. We also compared their performance in limited datasets.Estimated BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness was similar under all four designs. Empirical results suggested limited residual confounding by health care-seeking behavior. Analyses in limited datasets showed evidence of residual confounding, with estimates biased downward in the cohort design and upward in the test-negative design.Observational studies are used for estimating vaccine effectiveness under real-world conditions. The practical performance of two common approaches - cohort and test-negative designs - need to be compared for Covid-19 vaccines.","28":"The World Health Organization declared the ongoing Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in the Americas a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on February 1, 2016. ZIKV disease in humans is characterized by a \"dengue-like\" syndrome including febrile illness and rash. However, ZIKV infection in early pregnancy has been associated with severe birth defects, including microcephaly and other developmental issues. Mechanistic models of disease transmission can be used to forecast trajectories and likely disease burden but are currently hampered by substantial uncertainty on the epidemiology of the disease (e.g., the role of asymptomatic transmission, generation interval, incubation period, and key drivers). When insight is limited, phenomenological models provide a starting point for estimation of key transmission parameters, such as the reproduction number, and forecasts of epidemic impact.Phenomenological models represent promising tools to generate early forecasts of epidemic impact particularly in the context of substantial uncertainty in epidemiological parameters. Our findings underscore the need to treat the reproduction number as a dynamic quantity even during the early growth phase, and emphasize the sensitivity of reproduction number estimates to assumptions on the generation interval distribution.The reproduction number rapidly declined from 10.3 (95% CI: 8.3, 12.4) in the first disease generation to 2.2 (95% CI: 1.9, 2.8) in the second disease generation, assuming a gamma-distributed generation interval with the mean of 14 days and standard deviation of 2 days. The generalized-Richards model outperformed the logistic growth model and provided forecasts within 22% of the actual epidemic size based on an assessment 30 days into the epidemic, with the epidemic peaking on day 36.We obtained daily counts of suspected Zika cases by date of symptoms onset from the Secretary of Health of Antioquia, Colombia during January-April 2016. We calibrated the generalized Richards model, a phenomenological model that accommodates a variety of early exponential and sub-exponential growth kinetics, against the early epidemic trajectory and generated predictions of epidemic size. The reproduction number was estimated by applying the renewal equation to incident cases simulated from the fitted generalized-growth model and assuming gamma or exponentially-distributed generation intervals derived from the literature. We estimated the reproduction number for an increasing duration of the epidemic growth phase.","29":"There is large interest in networked social science experiments for understanding human behavior at-scale. Significant effort is required to perform data analytics on experimental outputs and for computational modeling of custom experiments. Moreover, experiments and modeling are often performed in a cycle, enabling iterative experimental refinement and data modeling to uncover interesting insights and to generate\/refute hypotheses about social behaviors. The current practice for social analysts is to develop tailor-made computer programs and analytical scripts for experiments and modeling. This often leads to inefficiencies and duplication of effort. In this work, we propose a pipeline framework to take a significant step towards overcoming these challenges. Our contribution is to describe the design and implementation of a software system to automate many of the steps involved in analyzing social science experimental data, building models to capture the behavior of human subjects, and providing data to test hypotheses. The proposed pipeline framework consists of formal models, formal algorithms, and theoretical models as the basis for the design and implementation. We propose a formal data model, such that if an experiment can be described in terms of this model, then our pipeline software can be used to analyze data efficiently. The merits of the proposed pipeline framework is elaborated by several case studies of networked social science experiments.","30":"An institution-based retrospective cohort study was conducted in diabetic follow-up clinics of Gurage Zone by reviewing 540 consecutively selected records among the records enrolled from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019. The outcome variable was incidence rate and survival time to the occurrences of hypertension (a systolic blood pressure at or above 140 mmHg and\/or a diastolic blood pressure at or above 90 mm Hg and known hypertensive cases taken from adults' age\u2009\u226518 years) among admitted diabetic patients (fasting blood sugar \u2265126 mg\/dL or random blood sugar \u2265200 mg\/dL). Data were collected using a standardized checklist by trained professionals by reviewing records of all clients ever enrolled. Data were cleaned and entered by Epi info version 7 and analyzed by STATA. A Cox-proportional hazard regression model was built to identify predictors of development of hypertension.The risk of occurrences of hypertension among diabetic patients was high at the early periods and the risk was less at the late diabetic periods and the incidence density rate of hypertension among diabetic patients was high. In addition, age, BMI, type of DM, comorbidity, and drug adherence were independent predictors of occurrences of hypertension. Therefore, intervention to further reduce its occurrence has to focus on drug adherence and prevention of infection. AHR=2.3 (95% CI=1.06-3.68), Type II diabetes mellitus (DM) AHR=2.0 (95% CI=1.16-3.04), presence of comorbidity AHR=2.9 (95% CI=1.74-4.58), and poor drug adherence AHR=2.5 (95% CI=1.45-4.65) predicted the development of hypertension.It is expected that around 50% of individuals with diabetes mellitus will develop hypertension in the course of medical follow-up. However, with strict medical follow-up and adherence to medical advice the incidence of hypertension can be highly reduced and the time to occurrence can be delayed. Therefore, this paper aimed to measure the time to development of hypertension and identify its predictors among a 10-year cohort of diabetic patients who have medical follow-up in health facilities of Gurage Zone.","31":" of 0.982 (95% CI: 0.849 - 1.107) in Santa Clara County. After June 1 (the end-date for Santa Clara County shelter-in-place as of April 27), we estimate a shift to partial social distancing, combined with rigorous testing and isolation of symptomatic individuals, is a viable alternative to indefinitely maintaining shelter-in-place. We also estimate that if Santa Clara County had waited one week longer before issuing shelter-in-place orders, 95 additional people would have died by April 22 (95% CI: 7 - 283). Given early life-saving shelter-in-place orders in Santa Clara County, longer-term moderate social distancing and testing and isolation of symptomatic individuals have the potential to contain the size and toll of the COVID-19 pandemic in Santa Clara County, and may be effective in other locations.","32":"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted many facets of human behavior, including human mobility partially driven by the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as stay at home orders, travel restrictions, and workplace and school closures. Given the importance of human mobility in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, there have been an increase in analyses of mobility data to understand the COVID-19 pandemic to date. However, despite an abundance of these analyses, few have focused on Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Here, we use mobile phone calling data to provide a spatially refined analysis of sub-national human mobility patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 2020-July 2021 in Zambia using transmission and mobility models. Overall, among highly trafficked intra-province routes, mobility decreased up to 52% during the time of the strictest NPIs (March-May 2020) compared to baseline. However, despite dips in mobility during the first wave of COVID-19 cases, mobility returned to baseline levels and did not drop again suggesting COVID-19 cases did not influence mobility in subsequent waves.","33":"This study facilitates open science in metabolomics by providing an implementation solution for adopting FAIR4RS in the LC-HRMS metabolomics data processing software. We believe our evaluation guidelines and results can help improve the FAIRness of research software.Liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) is a popular approach for metabolomics data acquisition and requires many data processing software tools. The FAIR Principles - Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability - were proposed to promote open science and reusable data management, and to maximize the benefit obtained from contemporary and formal scholarly digital publishing. More recently, the FAIR principles were extended to include Research Software (FAIR4RS).We evaluated 124 LC-HRMS metabolomics data processing software obtained from a systematic review and selected 61 software for detailed evaluation using FAIR4RS-related criteria, which were extracted from the literature along with internal discussions. We assigned each criterion one or more FAIR4RS categories through discussion. The minimum, median, and maximum percentages of criteria fulfillment of software were 21.6%, 47.7%, and 71.8%. Statistical analysis revealed no significant improvement in FAIRness over time. We identified four criteria covering multiple FAIR4RS categories but had a low %fulfillment: (1) No software had semantic annotation of key information; (2) only 6.3% of evaluated software were registered to Zenodo and received DOIs; (3) only 14.5% of selected software had official software containerization or virtual machine; (4) only 16.7% of evaluated software had a fully documented functions in code. According to the results, we discussed improvement strategies and future directions.","34":"Billions of doses of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have been administered globally, dramatically reducing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) incidence and severity in some settings. Many studies suggest vaccines provide a high degree of protection against infection and disease, but precise estimates vary and studies differ in design, outcomes measured, dosing regime, location, and circulating virus strains. In this study, we conduct a systematic review of COVID-19 vaccines through February 2022. We included efficacy data from Phase 3 clinical trials for 15 vaccines undergoing World Health Organization Emergency Use Listing evaluation and real-world effectiveness for 8 vaccines with observational studies meeting inclusion criteria. Vaccine metrics collected include protection against asymptomatic infection, any infection, symptomatic COVID-19, and severe outcomes including hospitalization and death, for partial or complete vaccination, and against variants of concern Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron. We additionally review the epidemiological principles behind the design and interpretation of vaccine efficacy and effectiveness studies, including important sources of heterogeneity.","35":"In recent years, a number of systems capable of predicting future infectious disease incidence have been developed. As more of these systems are operationalized, it is important that the forecasts generated by these different approaches be formally reconciled so that individual forecast error and bias are reduced. Here we present a first example of such multi-system, or superensemble, forecast. We develop three distinct systems for predicting dengue, which are applied retrospectively to forecast outbreak characteristics in San Juan, Puerto Rico. We then use Bayesian averaging methods to combine the predictions from these systems and create superensemble forecasts. We demonstrate that on average, the superensemble approach produces more accurate forecasts than those made from any of the individual forecasting systems.","36":"Non-monogamous mating behaviors including polygyny or extra-pair paternity are theorized to amplify sexual selection, since some males attract multiple mates or copulate with paired females. In several well-studied songbird species, females prefer more complex songs and larger repertoires; thus, non-monogamous mating behaviors are predicted to accelerate song evolution, particularly toward increased complexity. However, studies within songbird clades have yielded mixed results, and the effect of non-monogamy on song evolution remains unclear. Here, we construct a large-scale database synthesizing mating system, extra-pair paternity, and song information and perform comparative analyses alongside songbird genetic phylogenies. Our results suggest that polygyny drives faster evolution of syllable repertoire size (measured as average number of unique syllables), but this rapid evolution does not produce larger repertoires in polygynous species. Instead, both large and small syllable repertoires quickly evolve toward moderate sizes in polygynous lineages. Contrary to expectation, high rates of extra-pair paternity coincide with smaller repertoires.","37":"Inference on unknown quantities in dynamical systems via observational data is essential for providing meaningful insight, furnishing accurate predictions, enabling robust control, and establishing appropriate designs for future experiments. Merging mathematical theory with empirical measurements in a statistically coherent way is critical and challenges abound, e.g., ill-posedness of the parameter estimation problem, proper regularization and incorporation of prior knowledge, and computational limitations. To address these issues, we propose a new method for learning parameterized dynamical systems from data. We first customize and fit a surrogate stochastic process directly to observational data, front-loading with statistical learning to respect prior knowledge (e.g., smoothness), cope with challenging data features like heteroskedasticity, heavy tails, and censoring. Then, samples of the stochastic process are used as \"surrogate data\" and point estimates are computed via ordinary point estimation methods in a modular fashion. Attractive features of this two-step approach include modularity and trivial parallelizability. We demonstrate its advantages on a predator-prey simulation study and on a real-world application involving within-host influenza virus infection data paired with a viral kinetic model, with comparisons to a more conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based Bayesian approach.","38":"The Brazilian western Amazon is experiencing its largest laboratory-confirmed Oropouche virus (OROV) outbreak, with more than 6,300 reported cases between 2022 and 2024. Here, we sequenced and analyzed 382 OROV genomes from human samples collected in Amazonas, Acre, Rond\u00f4nia, and Roraima states, between August 2022 and February 2024, to uncover the origin and genetic evolution of OROV in the current outbreak. Genomic analyses revealed that the upsurge of OROV cases in the Brazilian Amazon coincides with spread of a novel reassortant lineage containing the M segment of viruses detected in the eastern Amazon region (2009-2018) and the L and S segments of viruses detected in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador (2008-2021). The novel reassortant likely emerged in the Amazonas state between 2010 and 2014 and spread through long-range dispersion events during the second half of the 2010s. Phylodynamics reconstructions showed that the current OROV spread was mainly driven by short-range ( 10 km) OROV migrations were also detected, consistent with viral dispersion by humans. Our data provides a view of the unprecedented spread and evolution of OROV in Brazilian western Amazon region.","39":"A scientist may publish tens or hundreds of papers over a career, but these contributions are not evenly spaced in time. Sixty years of studies on career productivity patterns in a variety of fields suggest an intuitive and universal pattern: Productivity tends to rise rapidly to an early peak and then gradually declines. Here, we test the universality of this conventional narrative by analyzing the structures of individual faculty productivity time series, constructed from over 200,000 publications and matched with hiring data for 2,453 tenure-track faculty in all 205 PhD-granting computer science departments in the United States and Canada. Unlike prior studies, which considered only some faculty or some institutions, or lacked common career reference points, here we combine a large bibliographic dataset with comprehensive information on career transitions that covers an entire field of study. We show that the conventional narrative confidently describes only one-fifth of faculty, regardless of department prestige or researcher gender, and the remaining four-fifths of faculty exhibit a rich diversity of productivity patterns. To explain this diversity, we introduce a simple model of productivity trajectories and explore correlations between its parameters and researcher covariates, showing that departmental prestige predicts overall individual productivity and the timing of the transition from first- to last-author publications. These results demonstrate the unpredictability of productivity over time and open the door for new efforts to understand how environmental and individual factors shape scientific productivity.","40":"Abstract\r\n\r\n1. and competition are both ubiquitous interactions in ecological communities. The ability of host species to interact directly via competition and indirectly through shared parasites suggests that host traits related to competition and parasitism are likely important in structuring communities and disease dynamics. Specifically, those host traits affecting competition and those mediating parasitism are often correlated either because of trade\u2010offs (in resource acquisition or resource allocation) or condition dependence, yet the consequences of these trait relationships for community and epidemiological dynamics are poorly understood.\r\n2. We conducted a literature review of parasite\u2010related host traits\u0096competitive ability relationships. We found that transmission\u0096competitive ability relationships were most often reported, and that superior competitors exhibited elevated transmission relative to their less\u2010competitive counterparts in nearly 80% of the cases. We also found a significant number of virulence\u0096competitive ability and parasite shedding\u0096competitive ability relationships.\r\n3. We investigated these links by altering the relationship between host competitive ability and three parasite\u2010related traits (transmission, virulence and parasite shedding rates) in a simple model, incorporating competitive asymmetries in a multi\u2010host community.\r\n4. We show that these relationships can lead to a range of different communities. For example, depending on the strength and direction of these distinct trait relationships, we observed communities with anywhere from high parasite prevalence to complete parasite extinction, and either one, two or the maximum of three host species coexisting.\r\n5. Our results suggest that parasite\u0096competitive ability relationships may be common in nature, that further integration of these relationships can produce novel and unexpected community and disease dynamics, and that generalizations may allow for the prediction of how parasitism and competition jointly structure disease and diversity in natural communities.","41":"Initial ESI-determined triage score was classified as inaccurate for 16,426 of 96,071 patient encounters. Under-triage was associated with a significantly higher rate of admission and critical outcome, while over-triage was associated with a lower rate of both. A number of factors identifiable at time of presentation including advanced age, bradycardia, tachycardia, hypoxia, hyperthermia, and several specific chief complaints (i.e., neurologic complaints, chest pain, shortness of breath) were identified as independent predictors of under-triage, while other chief complaints (i.e., hypertension and allergic complaints) were independent predictors of over-triage.Despite rigorous and ongoing training of ESI users, a large number of patients in this cohort were under- or over-triaged. Advanced age, vital sign derangements, and specific chief complaints-all subject to limited guidance by the ESI algorithm-were particularly under-appreciated.Emergency department (ED) triage is performed to prioritize care for patients with critical and time-sensitive illness. Triage errors create opportunity for increased morbidity and mortality. Here, we sought to measure the frequency of under- and over-triage of patients by nurses using the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) in Brazil and to identify factors independently associated with each.This was a single-center retrospective cohort study. The accuracy of initial ESI score assignment was determined by comparison with a score entered at the close of each ED encounter by treating physicians with full knowledge of actual resource utilization, disposition, and acute outcomes. Chi-square analysis was used to validate this surrogate gold standard, via comparison of associations with disposition and clinical outcomes. Independent predictors of under- and over-triage were identified by multivariate logistic regression.","42":"The principles of genetics apply across the entire tree of life. At the cellular level we share biological mechanisms with species from which we diverged millions, even billions of years ago. We can exploit this common ancestry to learn about health and disease, by analyzing DNA and protein sequences, but also through the observable outcomes of genetic differences, i.e. phenotypes. To solve challenging disease problems we need to unify the heterogeneous data that relates genomics to disease traits. Without a big-picture view of phenotypic data, many questions in genetics are difficult or impossible to answer. The Monarch Initiative (https:\/\/monarchinitiative.org) provides tools for genotype-phenotype analysis, genomic diagnostics, and precision medicine across broad areas of disease.","43":"Routine viral testing strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection might facilitate safe airline travel during the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigate global spread of the virus. However, the effectiveness of these test-and-travel strategies to reduce passenger risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and population-level transmission remains unknown.University of California, San Francisco.In this simulation study, we developed a microsimulation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a cohort of 100\u2009000 US domestic airline travellers using publicly available data on COVID-19 clinical cases and published natural history parameters to assign individuals one of five health states of susceptible to infection, latent period, early infection, late infection, or recovered. We estimated a per-day risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 corresponding to a daily incidence of 150 infections per 100\u2009000 people. We assessed five testing strategies: (1) anterior nasal PCR test within 3 days of departure, (2) PCR within 3 days of departure and 5 days after arrival, (3) rapid antigen test on the day of travel (assuming 90% of the sensitivity of PCR during active infection), (4) rapid antigen test on the day of travel and PCR test 5 days after arrival, and (5) PCR test 5 days after arrival. Strategies 2 and 4 included a 5-day quarantine after arrival. The travel period was defined as 3 days before travel to 2 weeks after travel. Under each scenario, individuals who tested positive before travel were not permitted to travel. The primary study outcome was cumulative number of infectious days in the cohort over the travel period without isolation or quarantine (population-level transmission risk), and the key secondary outcome was the number of infectious people detected on the day of travel (passenger risk of infection).Routine asymptomatic testing for SARS-CoV-2 before travel can be an effective strategy to reduce passenger risk of infection during travel, although abbreviated quarantine with post-travel testing is probably needed to reduce population-level transmission due to importation of infection when travelling from a high to low incidence setting.We estimated that in a cohort of 100\u2009000 airline travellers, in a scenario with no testing or screening, there would be 8357 (95% uncertainty interval 6144-12831) infectious days with 649 (505-950) actively infectious passengers on the day of travel. The pre-travel PCR test reduced the number of infectious days from 8357 to 5401 (3917-8677), a reduction of 36% (29-41) compared with the base case, and identified 569 (88% [76-92]) of 649 actively infectious travellers on the day of flight; the addition of post-travel quarantine and PCR reduced the number of infectious days to 2520 days (1849-4158), a reduction of 70% (64-75) compared with the base case. The rapid antigen test on the day of travel reduced the number of infectious days to 5674 (4126-9081), a reduction of 32% (26-38) compared with the base case, and identified 560 (86% [83-89]) actively infectious travellers; the addition of post-travel quarantine and PCR reduced the number of infectious days to 3124 (2356-495), a reduction of 63% (58-66) compared with the base case. The post-travel PCR alone reduced the number of infectious days to 4851 (3714-7679), a reduction of 42% (35-49) compared with the base case.","44":" Animals and their viruses are connected by a sprawling, tangled network of species interactions. Data on the host-virus network are available from several sources, which use different naming conventions and often report metadata in different levels of detail. VIRION is a new database that combines several of these existing data sources, reconciles taxonomy to a single consistent backbone, and reports metadata in a format designed by and for virologists. Researchers can use VIRION to easily answer questions like \"Can any fish viruses infect humans?\" or \"Which bats host coronaviruses?\" or to build more advanced predictive models, making it an unprecedented step toward a full inventory of the global virome.","45":"China has low seasonal influenza vaccination rates among priority populations. In this study, we aimed to evaluate a pay-it-forward strategy to increase influenza vaccine uptake in rural, suburban, and urban settings in China.The pay-it-forward intervention seemed to be effective in improving influenza vaccine uptake and community engagement. Our data have implications for prosocial interventions to enhance influenza vaccine uptake in countries where influenza vaccines are available for a fee.Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the UK National Institute for Health Research.From Sept 21, 2020, to March 3, 2021, 300 enrolees were recruited from patients visiting three primary care clinics. 55 (37%) of 150 people in the standard-of-care group (40 [53%] of 75 children and 15 [20%] of 75 older adults) and 111 (74%) of 150 in the pay-it-forward group (66 [88%] of 75 children and 45 [60%] of 75 older adults) received an influenza vaccine. People in the pay-it-forward group were more likely to receive an influenza vaccine compared with those in the standard-of-care group (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6\u00b77 [95% CI 2\u00b77-16\u00b76] among children and 5\u00b70 [2\u00b73-10\u00b78] among older adults). People in the pay-it-forward group had greater confidence in vaccine safety (aOR 2\u00b72 [95% CI 1\u00b72-3\u00b79]), importance (3\u00b71 [1\u00b76-5\u00b79]), and effectiveness (3\u00b71 [1\u00b77-5\u00b77]). In the pay-it-forward group, 107 (96%) of 111 participants donated money for subsequent vaccinations. The pay-it-forward group had a lower economic cost (calculated as the cost without subtraction of donations) per person vaccinated (US$45\u00b760) than did the standard-of-care group ($64\u00b767).We performed a quasi-experimental pragmatic trial to examine the effectiveness of a pay-it-forward intervention (a free influenza vaccine and an opportunity to donate financially to support vaccination of other individuals) to increase influenza vaccine uptake compared with standard-of-care user-paid vaccination among children (aged between 6 months and 8 years) and older people (\u226560 years) in China. Recruitment took place in the standard-of-care group until the expected sample size was reached and then in the pay-it-forward group in primary care clinics from a rural site (Yangshan), a suburban site (Zengcheng), and an urban site (Tianhe). Participants were introduced to the influenza vaccine by project staff using a pamphlet about influenza vaccination and were either asked to pay out-of-pocket at the standard market price (US$8\u00b75-23\u00b72; standard-of-care group) or to donate any amount anonymously (pay-it-forward group). Participants had to be eligible to receive an influenza vaccine and to have not received an influenza vaccine in the past year. The primary outcome was vaccine uptake. Secondary outcomes were vaccine confidence and costs (from the health-care provider perspective). Regression methods compared influenza vaccine uptake and vaccine confidence between the two groups. This trial is registered with ChiCTR, ChiCTR2000040048.","46":"Madagascar has experienced significant environmental change since 1960, particularly through forest clearing for agricultural expansion. Climatic patterns are undergoing change in Madagascar as well, with increasing temperatures, droughts, and cyclonic activity. The impact of these environmental and climatic changes will pose threats to food availability, income generation, and local ecosystems, with significant potential effects on the spatial and temporal distribution of disease burden. This study seeks to describe the health status of a large sample of geographically and socially diverse Malagasy communities through multiple clinical measurements, detailed social surveys, and paired data on regional variation in local ecologies. With an increased understanding of the current patterns of variation in human health and nutrition, future studies will be better able to identify associations with climate and anticipate and mitigate the burdens expected from larger, longer-term changes. Our mixed-method approach included an observational cross-sectional study. Research subjects were men, women, and children from 1,125 households evenly distributed across 24 communities in four ecologically and socio-demographically distinct regions of Madagascar. For these 1,125 households, all persons of both sexes and all ages therein (for a total of 6,292 individuals) were recruited into the research study and a total of 5,882 individuals were enrolled. Through repeated social survey recalls and focus group meetings, we obtained social and demographic data, including broad categories of seasonal movements, and characterized the fluctuation of income generation, food production and dietary consumption. Through collection of clinical and biological samples for both point-of-care diagnoses and laboratory analyses, we obtained detailed occurrence (and importantly co-occurrence) data on micronutrient nutritional, infectious disease, and non-communicable disease status. Our research highlights the highly variable social, cultural, and environmental contexts of health conditions in Madagascar, and the tremendous inter-regional, inter-community, and intra-community variation in nutritional and disease status. More than 30% of the surveyed population was afflicted by anemia and 14% of the population had a current malaria infection. This type of rich metadata associated with a suite of biological samples and nutritional and disease outcome data should allow disentangling some of the underlying drivers of ill health across the changing landscapes of Madagascar.","47":"Nanoparticle-based therapeutic formulations are being increasingly explored for the treatment of various ailments. Despite numerous advances, the success of nanoparticle-based technologies in treating brain diseases has been limited. Translational hurdles of nanoparticle therapies are attributed primarily to their limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is one of the body's most exclusive barriers. Several efforts have been focused on developing affinity-based agents and using them to increase nanoparticle accumulation at the brain endothelium. Very little is known about the role of fundamental physical parameters of nanoparticles such as size, shape, and flexibility in determining their interactions with and penetration across the BBB. Using a three-dimensional human BBB microfluidic model (\u03bcHuB), we investigate the impact of these physical parameters on nanoparticle penetration across the BBB. To gain insights into the dependence of transport on nanoparticle properties, two separate parameters were measured: the number of nanoparticles that fully cross the BBB and the number that remain associated with the endothelium. Association of nanoparticles with the brain endothelium was substantially impacted by their physical characteristics. Hard particles associate more with the endothelium compared to soft particles, as do small particles compared to large particles, and spherical particles compared to rod-shaped particles. Transport across the BBB also exhibited a dependence on nanoparticle properties. A nonmonotonic dependence on size was observed, where 200\u2009nm particles exhibited higher BBB transport compared to 100 and 500\u2009nm spheres. Rod-shaped particles exhibited higher BBB transport when normalized by endothelial association and soft particles exhibited comparable transport to hard particles when normalized by endothelial association. Tuning nanoparticles' physical parameters could potentially enhance their ability to cross the BBB for therapeutic applications.","48":"Summary of findings tables in systematic reviews are highly informative but require epidemiological training to be interpreted correctly. The usage of fishbone diagrams as graphical displays could offer researchers an effective approach to simplify content for readers with limited epidemiological training. In this paper we demonstrate how fishbone diagrams can be applied to systematic reviews and present the results of an initial user testing.Findings from two systematic reviews were graphically depicted in the form of the fishbone diagram. To test the utility of fishbone diagrams compared with summary of findings tables, we developed and pilot-tested an online survey using Qualtrics. Respondents were randomized to the fishbone diagram or a summary of findings table presenting the same body of evidence. They answered questions in both open-ended and closed-answer formats; all responses were anonymous. Measures of interest focused on first and second impressions, the ability to find and interpret critical information, as well as user experience with both displays. We asked respondents about the perceived utility of fishbone diagrams compared to summary of findings tables. We analyzed quantitative data by conducting t-tests and comparing descriptive statistics.Fishbone diagrams are compact visualizations that, theoretically, may prove useful for summarizing the findings of systematic reviews. Initial user testing, however, did not support the utility of such graphical displays.Based on real world systematic reviews, we provide two different fishbone diagrams to show how they might be used to display complex information in a clear and succinct manner. User testing on 77 students with basic epidemiological training revealed that participants preferred summary of findings tables over fishbone diagrams. Significantly more participants liked the summary of findings table than the fishbone diagram (71.8% vs. 44.8%; p\u2009<\u2009.01); significantly more participants found the fishbone diagram confusing (63.2% vs. 35.9%, p\u2009<\u2009.05) or indicated that it was difficult to find information (65.8% vs. 45%; p\u2009<\u2009.01). However, more than half of the participants in both groups were unable to find critical information and answer three respective questions correctly (52.6% in the fishbone group; 51.3% in the summary of findings group).","49":"A wide range of approaches has been used to manage the spread of invasive species, yet invaders continue to be a challenge to control. In some cases, management actions have no effect or may even inadvertently benefit the targeted invader. Here, we use the mid-20th century management of the Red Imported Fire Ant, Solenopsis invicta, in the US as a motivating case study to explore the conditions under which such wasted management effort may occur. Introduced in approximately 1940, the fire ant spread widely through the southeast US\u00a0and became a problematic pest. Historically, fire ants were managed with broad-spectrum pesticides; unfortunately, these efforts were largely unsuccessful. One hypothesis suggests that, by also killing native ants, mass pesticide application reduced competitive burdens thereby enabling fire ants to invade more quickly than they would in the absence of management. We use a mechanistic competition model to demonstrate the landscape-level effects of such management. We explicitly model the extent and location of pesticide applications, showing that the same pesticide application can have a positive, neutral, or negative effect on the progress of an invasion, depending on where it is applied on the landscape with respect to the invasion front. When designing management, the target species is often considered alone; however, this work suggests that leveraging existing biotic interactions, specifically competition with native species, can increase the efficacy of management. Our model not only highlights the potential unintended consequences of ignoring biotic interactions, but also provides a framework for developing spatially explicit management strategies that take advantage of these biotic interactions to work smarter, not harder.","50":"Due to delay in reporting, the daily national and statewide COVID-19 incidence counts are often unreliable and need to be estimated from recent data. This process is known in economics as nowcasting. We describe in this paper a simple random forest statistical model for nowcasting the COVID - 19 daily new infection counts based on historic data along with a set of simple covariates, such as the currently reported infection counts, day of the week, and time since first reporting. We apply the model to adjust the daily infection counts in Ohio, and show that the predictions from this simple data-driven method compare favorably both in quality and computational burden to those obtained from the state-of-the-art hierarchical Bayesian model employing a complex statistical algorithm. The interactive notebook for performing nowcasting is available online at https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/simpleMLnowcasting.","51":"The geographic spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections from the epicenter of Wuhan, China, has provided an opportunity to study the natural history of the recently emerged virus. Using publicly available event-date data from the ongoing epidemic, the present study investigated the incubation period and other time intervals that govern the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of 2-14 days with 95% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated using the best-fit lognormal distribution. The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and\/or isolation) was estimated at 3-4 days without truncation and at 5-9 days when right truncated. Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days. The median time delay of 13 days from illness onset to death (17 days with right truncation) should be considered when estimating the COVID-19 case fatality risk.","52":"The purpose of this study was to test the effect of subconcussive head impacts on acute changes in plasma S100B. In this randomized controlled trial, 79 healthy adult soccer players were randomly assigned to either the heading (n = 41) or kicking-control groups (n = 38). The heading group executed 10 headers with soccer balls projected at a speed of 25 mph, whereas the kicking-control group performed 10 kicks. Plasma samples were obtained at pre-, 0h post-, 2h post- and 24h post-intervention and measured for S100B. The primary hypothesis was that there would be a significant group difference (group-by-time interaction) in plasma S100B at 2h post-intervention. Secondary hypotheses included (1) no significant group differences in plasma S100B concentrations at 0h post- and 24h post-intervention; (2) a significant within-group increase in S100B concentrations in the heading group at 2h post-intervention compared to pre-intervention; and (3) no significant within-group changes in plasma S100B in the kicking-control group. Data from 68 subjects were available for analysis (heading n = 37, kicking n = 31). There were no differences in S100B concentrations between heading and kicking groups over time, as evidenced by nonsignificant group-by-time interaction at 2h post-intervention (B = 2.20, 95%CI [-22.22, 26.63], p = 0.86) and at all the other time points (0h post: B = -11.05, 95%CI [-35.37, 13.28], p = 0.38; 24h post: B = 16.11, 95%CI [-8.29, 40.51], p = 0.20). Part of the secondary outcome, the heading group showed elevation in plasma S100B concentrations at 24h post-intervention compared to pre-heading baseline (B = 19.57, 95%CI [3.13, 36.02], p = 0.02), whereas all other within-group comparisons in both remained nonsignificant. The data suggest that 10 bouts of acute controlled soccer headings do not elevate S100B concentrations up to 24-hour post-heading. Further dose-response studies with longer follow-up time points may help determine thresholds of acute soccer heading exposure that are related to astrocyte activation. The protocol was registered under ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03488381; retrospectively registered.).","53":"SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported in all age groups including infants, children, and adolescents. However, the role of children in the COVID-19 pandemic is still uncertain. This systematic review of early studies synthesises evidence on the susceptibility of children to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the severity and clinical outcomes in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 by children in the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed. Reviewers extracted data from relevant, peer-reviewed studies published up to July 4th 2020 during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak using a standardised form and assessed quality using the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. For studies included in the meta-analysis, we used a random effects model to calculate pooled estimates of the proportion of children considered asymptomatic or in a severe or critical state. We identified 2775 potential studies of which 128 studies met our inclusion criteria; data were extracted from 99, which were then quality assessed. Finally, 29 studies were considered for the meta-analysis that included information of symptoms and\/or severity, these were further assessed based on patient recruitment. Our pooled estimate of the proportion of test positive children who were asymptomatic was 21.1% (95% CI: 14.0-28.1%), based on 13 included studies, and the proportion of children with severe or critical symptoms was 3.8% (95% CI: 1.5-6.0%), based on 14 included studies. We did not identify any studies designed to assess transmissibility in children and found that susceptibility to infection in children was highly variable across studies. Children's susceptibility to infection and onward transmissibility relative to adults is still unclear and varied widely between studies. However, it is evident that most children experience clinically mild disease or remain asymptomatically infected. More comprehensive contact-tracing studies combined with serosurveys are needed to quantify children's transmissibility relative to adults. With children back in schools, testing regimes and study protocols that will allow us to better understand the role of children in this pandemic are critical.","54":"RECOVER, VEO, AXA, Groupama, SpF, IBEID, INCEPTION, EMERGEN.Ending Zero-COVID is challenging, particularly when vaccine coverage is low. Considering Wallis and Futuna, a French Zero-COVID territory affected by reluctance to vaccination, low immunity and high levels of comorbidities, we investigate how targeted use of nirmatrelvir\/ritonavir (brand name Paxlovid) can complement vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), and mitigate the epidemic rebound expected when Zero-COVID ends.We developed a discrete age-stratified compartmental model describing SARS-CoV-2 spread and healthcare impact once Wallis and Futuna reopens. It accounts for comorbidity risk groups (CRG), vaccine coverage (2 doses, 3\u00a0doses), the effectiveness of vaccines (recent or old injection), treatments and NPIs. In our baseline scenario, cases aged 65+ in intermediate\/high CRG and 40+ in high CRG are eligible for treatment.Modelling suggests that test and treat may contribute to the mitigation of epidemic rebounds at the end of Zero-COVID, particularly in populations with low immunity and high levels of comorbidities.The epidemic is expected to start 13-20 days after reopening with a doubling time of 1.6-3.7 days. For medium transmission intensity (R0\u00a0=\u00a05), 134 (115-156) hospital admissions are expected within 3 months, with no pharmaceutical measures. In our baseline scenario, admissions are reduced by 11%-21% if 50% of the target group receive treatment, with maximum impact when combined with NPIs and vaccination. The number of hospitalisations averted (HA) per patient treated (PT) is maximum when 65+ in high CRG are targeted (0.124 HA\/PT), quickly followed by 65+ in intermediate\/high CRG (0.097 HA\/PT), and any 65+ (0.093 HA\/PT). Expanding the target group increases both PT and HA, but marginal gains diminish.","55":"Diarrheal diseases remain a significant contributor to the global burden of disease. Climate change may increase their incidence by altering the epidemiology of waterborne pathogens through changes in rainfall patterns. To assess potential impacts of future changes in rainfall patterns, we analyzed 33,927 cases of diarrhea across all Ministry of Health clinical facilities in Esmeraldas Province, Ecuador, for a 24-month period from 2013 to 2014, using mixed-effects Poisson regression. We assessed the association between the incidence of diarrheal diseases and heavy rainfall events (HREs) and antecedent rainfall conditions. In rural areas, we found no significant associations between HREs and incidence. In urban areas, dry antecedent conditions were associated with higher incidence than wet conditions. In addition, HREs with dry antecedent conditions were associated with elevated incidence by up to 1.35 (incidence rate ratio, 95% CI: 1.14-1.60) times compared with similar conditions without HREs. These patterns may be driven by accumulation of fecal contamination during dry periods, followed by a flushing effect during HREs. This phenomenon is more important in dense urban environments with more impervious surfaces. These findings suggest that projected increases in rainfall variability and HREs may increase diarrhea burden in urban regions, which are rapidly expanding globally.","56":"Sleep is essential to cognitive function and health in humans, yet the ultimate reasons for sleep-i.e. 'why' sleep evolved-remain mysterious. We integrate findings from human sleep studies, the ethnographic record, and the ecology and evolution of mammalian sleep to better understand sleep along the human lineage and in the modern world. Compared to other primates, sleep in great apes has undergone substantial evolutionary change, with all great apes building a sleeping platform or 'nest'. Further evolutionary change characterizes human sleep, with humans having the shortest sleep duration, yet the highest proportion of rapid eye movement sleep among primates. These changes likely reflect that our ancestors experienced fitness benefits from being active for a greater portion of the 24-h cycle than other primates, potentially related to advantages arising from learning, socializing and defending against predators and hostile conspecifics. Perspectives from evolutionary medicine have implications for understanding sleep disorders; we consider these perspectives in the context of insomnia, narcolepsy, seasonal affective disorder, circadian rhythm disorders and sleep apnea. We also identify how human sleep today differs from sleep through most of human evolution, and the implications of these changes for global health and health disparities. More generally, our review highlights the importance of phylogenetic comparisons in understanding human health, including well-known links between sleep, cognitive performance and health in humans. ","57":"Mathematical and computational modeling approaches are increasingly used as quantitative tools in the analysis and forecasting of infectious disease epidemics. The growing need for realism in addressing complex public health questions is, however, calling for accurate models of the human contact patterns that govern the disease transmission processes. Here we present a data-driven approach to generate effective population-level contact matrices by using highly detailed macro (census) and micro (survey) data on key socio-demographic features. We produce age-stratified contact matrices for 35 countries, including 277 sub-national administratvie regions of 8 of those\u00a0countries, covering approximately 3.5 billion people and reflecting the high degree of cultural and societal diversity of the focus countries. We use the derived contact matrices to model the spread of airborne infectious diseases and show that sub-national heterogeneities in human mixing patterns have a marked impact on epidemic indicators such as the reproduction number and overall attack rate of epidemics of the same etiology. The contact patterns derived here are made publicly available as a modeling tool to study the impact of socio-economic differences and demographic heterogeneities across populations on the epidemiology of infectious diseases.","58":"Emerging resistance to bedaquiline (BDQ) threatens to undermine advances in the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DRTB). Characterizing serial Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) isolates collected during BDQ-based treatment can provide insights into the etiologies of BDQ resistance in this important group of DRTB patients.BDQ-resistant TB can arise via multiple, overlapping processes, including transmission of strains with pre-existing resistance. Capturing the within-host diversity of these infections could potentially improve clinical diagnosis, population-level surveillance, and molecular diagnostic test development.We measured mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT)-based BDQ minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of Mtb isolates collected from 195 individuals with no prior BDQ exposure who were receiving BDQ-based treatment for DRTB. We conducted whole-genome sequencing on serial Mtb isolates from all participants who had any isolate with a BDQ MIC >1 collected before or after starting treatment (95 total Mtb isolates from 24 participants).Sixteen of 24 participants had BDQ-resistant TB (MGIT MIC \u22654\u2005\u00b5g\/mL) and 8 had BDQ-intermediate infections (MGIT MIC = 2 \u00b5g\/mL). Participants with pre-existing resistance outnumbered those with resistance acquired during treatment, and 8 of 24 participants had polyclonal infections. BDQ resistance was observed across multiple Mtb strain types and involved a diverse catalog of mmpR5 (Rv0678) mutations, but no mutations in atpE or pepQ. Nine pairs of participants shared genetically similar isolates separated by <5 single nucleotide polymorphisms, concerning for potential transmitted BDQ resistance.","59":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.2196\/19170.].","60":"SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted through person-to-person contacts. It is important to collect information on age-specific contact patterns because SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, transmission, and morbidity vary by age. To reduce the risk of infection, social distancing measures have been implemented. Social contact data, which identify who has contact with whom especially by age and place are needed to identify high-risk groups and serve to inform the design of non-pharmaceutical interventions. We estimated and used negative binomial regression to compare the number of daily contacts during the first round (April-May 2020) of the Minnesota Social Contact Study, based on respondent's age, gender, race\/ethnicity, region, and other demographic characteristics. We used information on the age and location of contacts to generate age-structured contact matrices. Finally, we compared the age-structured contact matrices during the stay-at-home order to pre-pandemic matrices. During the state-wide stay-home order, the mean daily number of contacts was 5.7. We found significant variation in contacts by age, gender, race, and region. Adults between 40 and 50\u00a0years had the highest number of contacts. The way race\/ethnicity was coded influenced patterns between groups. Respondents living in Black households (which includes many White respondents living in inter-racial households with black family members) had 2.7 more contacts than respondents in White households; we did not find this same pattern when we focused on individual's reported race\/ethnicity. Asian or Pacific Islander respondents or in API households had approximately the same number of contacts as respondents in White households. Respondents in Hispanic households had approximately two fewer contacts compared to White households, likewise Hispanic respondents had three fewer contacts than White respondents. Most contacts were with other individuals in the same age group. Compared to the pre-pandemic period, the biggest declines occurred in contacts between children, and contacts between those over 60 with those below 60.","61":"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) constitute the front-line responses against epidemics. Yet, the interdependence of control measures and individual microeconomics, beliefs, perceptions and health incentives, is not well understood. Epidemics constitute complex adaptive systems where individual behavioral decisions drive and are driven by, among other things, the risk of infection. To study the impact of heterogeneous behavioral responses on the epidemic burden, we formulate a two risk-groups mathematical model that incorporates individual behavioral decisions driven by risk perceptions. Our results show a trade-off between the efforts to avoid infection by the risk-evader population, and the proportion of risk-taker individuals with relaxed infection risk perceptions. We show that, in a structured population, privately computed optimal behavioral responses may lead to an increase in the final size of the epidemic, when compared to the homogeneous behavior scenario. Moreover, we find that uncertain information on the individuals' true health state may lead to worse epidemic outcomes, ultimately depending on the population's risk-group composition. Finally, we find there is a set of specific optimal planning horizons minimizing the final epidemic size, which depend on the population structure.","62":"Chikungunya fever is an acute febrile illness caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), which is transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquitoes. Although chikungunya fever is rarely fatal, patients can experience debilitating symptoms that last from months to years. Here we comprehensively assess the global distribution of chikungunya and produce high-resolution maps, using an established modelling framework that combines a comprehensive occurrence database with bespoke environmental correlates, including up-to-date Aedes distribution maps. This enables estimation of the current total population-at-risk of CHIKV transmission and identification of areas where the virus may spread to in the future. We identified 94 countries with good evidence for current CHIKV presence and a set of countries in the New and Old World with potential for future CHIKV establishment, demonstrated by high environmental suitability for transmission and in some cases previous sporadic reports. Aedes aegypti presence was identified as one of the major contributing factors to CHIKV transmission but significant geographical heterogeneity exists. We estimated 1.3 billion people are living in areas at-risk of CHIKV transmission. These maps provide a baseline for identifying areas where prevention and control efforts should be prioritised and can be used to guide estimation of the global burden of CHIKV. ","63":"The prediction and characterization of outbreaks of infectious diseases such as influenza remains an open and important problem. This paper describes a framework for detecting and characterizing outbreaks of influenza and the results of testing it on data from ten outbreaks collected from two locations over five years. We model outbreaks with compartment models and explicitly model non-influenza influenza-like illnesses.","64":"When a novel influenza A virus with pandemic potential emerges, nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) often are the most readily available interventions to help slow transmission of the virus in communities, which is especially important before a pandemic vaccine becomes widely available. NPIs, also known as community mitigation measures, are actions that persons and communities can take to help slow the spread of respiratory virus infections, including seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses.These guidelines replace the 2007 Interim Pre-pandemic Planning Guidance: Community Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Mitigation in the United States - Early, Targeted, Layered Use of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions (https:\/\/stacks.cdc.gov\/view\/cdc\/11425). Several elements remain unchanged from the 2007 guidance, which described recommended NPIs and the supporting rationale and key concepts for the use of these interventions during influenza pandemics. NPIs can be phased in, or layered, on the basis of pandemic severity and local transmission patterns over time. Categories of NPIs include personal protective measures for everyday use (e.g., voluntary home isolation of ill persons, respiratory etiquette, and hand hygiene); personal protective measures reserved for influenza pandemics (e.g., voluntary home quarantine of exposed household members and use of face masks in community settings when ill); community measures aimed at increasing social distancing (e.g., school closures and dismissals, social distancing in workplaces, and postponing or cancelling mass gatherings); and environmental measures (e.g., routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces).Several new elements have been incorporated into the 2017 guidelines. First, to support updated recommendations on the use of NPIs, the latest scientific evidence available since the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 pandemic has been added. Second, a summary of lessons learned from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response is presented to underscore the importance of broad and flexible prepandemic planning. Third, a new section on community engagement has been included to highlight that the timely and effective use of NPIs depends on community acceptance and active participation. Fourth, to provide new or updated pandemic assessment and planning tools, the novel influenza virus pandemic intervals tool, the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool, the Pandemic Severity Assessment Framework, and a set of prepandemic planning scenarios are described. Finally, to facilitate implementation of the updated guidelines and to assist states and localities with prepandemic planning and decision-making, this report links to six supplemental prepandemic NPI planning guides for different community settings that are available online (https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nonpharmaceutical-interventions).","65":" < 0.05) increased \u2265C20 n-3 LC-PUFA (C20:5n-3 eicosapentaenoate, EPA + C22:5n3 docosapentaenoate, DPA + C22:6n3 docosahexanoate DHA); C18:3n-3 alpha-linolenate, ALA; C18:2 conjugated linoleic acid, CLA; total monounsaturated fatty acids, MUFA; polyunsaturated fatty acids, PUFA contents; and reduced the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids in all lamb organs and tissues without impacting shelf-life. The findings demonstrate that the inclusion of omega-3 oil in feedlot diets of lambs enhances the human health beneficial omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid profiles of edible muscle tissue and organs without compromising meat quality.","66":"To help achieve Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) goals of reducing new HIV incidence, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use and engagement must increase despite multidimensional barriers to scale-up and limitations in funding. We investigated the cost-effectiveness of interventions spanning the PrEP continuum of care.Strategies averted 0.2-4.2% new infections and gained 0.0045%-0.24% QALYs compared to the status quo. Initiation strategies achieved 20%-23% PrEP coverage (up from 15% with no interventions) and moderate clinical benefits at a high cost, while adherence strategies were relatively low cost and low benefit. Under our assumptions, the adherence and initiation combination strategy was cost-effective ($86,927\/QALY gained). Sensitivity analyses showed no strategies were cost-effective when intervention costs increased by 60% and the strategy combining all three interventions was cost-effective when PrEP costs decreased to $1,000\/month.Using a network-based HIV transmission model, we simulated lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and infections averted for eight intervention strategies using a health sector perspective. Strategies included a status quo (no interventions), three distinct interventions (targeting PrEP initiation, adherence, or persistence), and all possible intervention combinations. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated incrementally using a $100,000\/QALY gained threshold. We performed sensitivity analyses on PrEP costs, intervention costs, and intervention coverage.Men who have sex with men (MSM) in Atlanta, Georgia, a focal jurisdiction for the EHE plan.PrEP initiation interventions achieved moderate public health gains and could be cost-effective. However, substantial financial resources would be needed to improve the PrEP care continuum towards meeting EHE goals.","67":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common, contagious infection of the lungs and the respiratory tract. RSV is characterized by syncytia, which are multinuclear cells created by cells that have fused together. We use a mathematical model to study how different assumptions about the viral production and lifespan of syncytia change the resulting infection time course. We find that the effect of syncytia on viral titer is only apparent when the basic reproduction number for infection via syncytia formation is similar to the reproduction number for cell free viral transmission. When syncytia fusion rate is high, we find the presence of syncytia can lead to slowly growing infections if viral production is suppressed in syncytia. Our model provides insight into how the presence of syncytia can affect the time course of a viral infection.","68":"Our results quantified the significant benefits of early start of testing and high compliance with isolation. Early start of testing, even with low testing capacity over time, could significantly slow down the disease spread if compliance with isolation is high. By contrast, when the start of testing was delayed, the benefit of testing on reducing infection spread was limited, even when testing capacity was high; the additional testing capacity required increased superlinearly for each day of delay to achieve a similar infection attack rate as in starting testing earlier.Our study highlighted the importance of the early start of testing and public health messaging to promote isolation compliance when needed for an ongoing effective response to COVID-19 and future pandemics.To understand the interplay between these factors and provide further insight into policy decisions for future pandemics, we developed a compartmental model and simulated numerous scenarios using the dynamics of COVID-19 as a case study.Diagnostic tests\u00a0can play an important role in reducing the transmission of infectious respiratory diseases, particularly during a pandemic. The potential benefit of diagnostic testing depends on at least 4 factors: (1) how soon testing becomes available after the beginning of the pandemic and (2) at what capacity; (3) compliance with isolation after testing positive; and (4) compliance with isolation when experiencing symptoms, even in the absence of testing.","69":"Annual influenza B virus epidemics and outbreaks cause severe influenza diseases in humans and pose a threat to public health. China is an important epidemic area of influenza B viruses. However, the spatial, temporal transmission pathways and the demography history of influenza B viruses in China remain unknown. We collected the haemagglutinin gene sequences sampled of influenza B virus in China between 1973 and 2018. A Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo phylogeographic discrete approach was used to infer the spatial and temporal phylodynamics of influenza B virus. The Bayesian phylogeographic analysis of influenza B viruses showed that the North subtropical and South subtropical zones are the origins of the Victoria and Yamagata lineage viruses, respectively. Furthermore, the South temperate and North subtropical zones acted as transition nodes in the Victoria lineage virus dispersion network and that the North subtropical and Mid subtropical zones acted as transition nodes in the Yamagata lineage virus dispersion network. Our findings contribute to\u00a0the knowledge regarding the spatial and temporal patterns of influenza B virus outbreaks in China.","70":"A cohort of 70,549 adults seen in their respective practices (n\u2009=\u200924 with 1 drop out) at least once each year was followed. Baseline mean age was 55.1\u00a0years, 35\u00a0% were men, 21\u00a0% were non-white and 35\u00a0% were Hispanic. After one year, both intervention and control arms significantly (P\u2009<\u20090.001) increased influenza vaccination, with average increases of 2.7 to 6.5 percentage points. In regression analyses, likelihood of influenza vaccination was significantly higher in sites with lower percentages of patients with missed opportunities (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and, after adjusting for missed opportunities, the intervention further improved vaccination rates in Houston (lower baseline rates) but not Pittsburgh (higher baseline rates). In the follow-up intervention, the likelihood of vaccination increased for both intervention sites and those that reduced missed opportunities (P\u2009<\u20090.005).Twenty five primary care practices were recruited in 2013, stratified by city (Houston, Pittsburgh), location (rural, urban, suburban) and type (family medicine, internal medicine), and randomized to the intervention (n\u2009=\u200913) or control (n\u2009=\u200912) in Year 1 (2013-14). A follow-up intervention occurred in Year 2 (2014-15). Demographic and vaccination data were derived from de-identified electronic medical record extractions.This study was registered as a clinical trial on 03\/20\/2013 at ClinicalTrials.gov, Clinical Trial Registry Number: NCT01868334 , with a date of enrollment of the first participant to the trial of April 1, 2013.An evidence-based, step-by-step guide, the 4 Pillars\u2122 Practice Transformation Program, was the foundation of an intervention to increase adult immunizations in primary care and was tested in a randomized controlled cluster trial. The purpose of this study is to report changes in influenza immunization rates and on factors related to receipt of influenza vaccine.Reducing missed opportunities across the practice increases likelihood of influenza vaccination of adults. The 4 Pillars\u2122 Practice Transformation Program provides strategies for reducing missed opportunities to vaccinate adults.","71":"This essay provides a series of reflections on the current state of demography as seen by four early-career researchers who are actively engaged in aspects of the discipline as varied as research, teaching, mentorship, data collection efforts, policy making, and policy advising. Despite some claims that the discipline is weakening, we showcase the great potential of the field and outline promising pathways and novel directions for the future. In so doing, we critically assess recent innovations in data quality and availability, stressing the need to \"revolutionize\" the way that demographic methods are taught by adopting a viewpoint that more closely reflects the rapidly changing, or \"fast,\" nature of global social phenomena such as conflict-related displacements, environmental disasters, migration streams, pandemics, and evolving population policies. We conclude by discussing the relevance of careful demographic analyses for policy making, stressing three main points: (i) the need to make demography more visible and understandable to the public eye; (ii) the importance of engaging and co-creating with local communities to \"break\" the academic bubble; and (iii) the urge to counteract the spread of misinformation-a phenomenon that has become even more visible in the aftermath of the COVID-19 outbreak.","72":"The relationship between prevalence of infection and severe outcomes such as hospitalisation and death changed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Reliable estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR) and infection hospitalisation ratio (IHR) along with the time-delay between infection and hospitalisation\/death can inform forecasts of the numbers\/timing of severe outcomes and allow healthcare services to better prepare for periods of increased demand. The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study estimated swab positivity for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in England approximately monthly from May 2020 to March 2022. Here, we analyse the changing relationship between prevalence of swab positivity and the IFR and IHR over this period in England, using publicly available data for the daily number of deaths and hospitalisations, REACT-1 swab positivity data, time-delay models, and Bayesian P-spline models. We analyse data for all age groups together, as well as in 2 subgroups: those aged 65 and over and those aged 64 and under. Additionally, we analysed the relationship between swab positivity and daily case numbers to estimate the case ascertainment rate of England's mass testing programme. During 2020, we estimated the IFR to be 0.67% and the IHR to be 2.6%. By late 2021\/early 2022, the IFR and IHR had both decreased to 0.097% and 0.76%, respectively. The average case ascertainment rate over the entire duration of the study was estimated to be 36.1%, but there was some significant variation in continuous estimates of the case ascertainment rate. Continuous estimates of the IFR and IHR of the virus were observed to increase during the periods of Alpha and Delta's emergence. During periods of vaccination rollout, and the emergence of the Omicron variant, the IFR and IHR decreased. During 2020, we estimated a time-lag of 19 days between hospitalisation and swab positivity, and 26 days between deaths and swab positivity. By late 2021\/early 2022, these time-lags had decreased to 7 days for hospitalisations and 18 days for deaths. Even though many populations have high levels of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 from vaccination and natural infection, waning of immunity and variant emergence will continue to be an upwards pressure on the IHR and IFR. As investments in community surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection are scaled back, alternative methods are required to accurately track the ever-changing relationship between infection, hospitalisation, and death and hence provide vital information for healthcare provision and utilisation.","73":"There was no reported increase in the severity or duration of adverse events associated with the administration of an extra tetanus-containing vaccine within the previous five years (N\u202f=\u202f181) or multiple doses of tetanus-containing vaccines during the current pregnancy (N\u202f=\u202f98). Vaccination at least eight weeks prior to delivery resulted in high antibody titers to all B. pertussis antigens studied.The reactogenicity of Tdap vaccine administered during pregnancy was not affected by prior tetanus toxoid immunization. High transplacental antibody against B. pertussis antigens in the cord blood provides evidence of antibody transfer and should thus help to protect newborns from pertussis during early life.Pregnant Thai women have low antibody titers against B. pertussis antigens, which coincide with an increasing incidence of pertussis among Thai infants. Thus, there exists a potential benefit of a booster dose of tetanus- diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine administered during pregnancy. Here, we report the vaccine reactogenicity profile and birth outcomes in Tdap-vaccinated pregnant women who have or have not had prior immunization with tetanus vaccine, and the IgG levels to B. pertussis antigens in maternal and cord sera at delivery.Pregnant women (N\u202f=\u202f370) aged 18-40\u202fyears were administered the Tdap vaccine (Boostrix\u00ae, GlaxoSmithKline, Rixensart, Belgium) at 26-36\u202fweeks gestation. Adverse events following vaccination were identified by follow-up telephone call and medical record review. IgG against pertussis toxin (anti-PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (anti-FHA) and pertactin (anti-PRN) in both maternal and umbilical cord blood obtained at delivery were quantitatively evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EUROIMMUN\u00ae, L\u00fcbeck, Germany).","74":"In total, 11,285 multimorbidities among 439 common diseases were identified, and 46% of them were genetically interpretable at the loci, network, or overall genetic architecture levels. Multimorbidities affecting the same and different physiological systems displayed different patterns of the shared genetic components, with the former more likely to share loci-level genetic components while the latter more likely to share network-level genetic components. Moreover, both the loci- and network-level genetic components shared by multimorbidities converged on cell immunity, protein metabolism, and gene silencing. Furthermore, we found that the genetically interpretable multimorbidities tend to form network modules, mediated by hub diseases and featuring physiological categories. Finally, we showcased how hub diseases mediating the multimorbidity modules could help provide useful insights for the genetic contributors of multimorbidities.Our results provide a systematic resource for understanding the genetic predispositions of multimorbidities and indicate that hub diseases and converged molecules and functions may be the key for treating multimorbidities. We have created an online database that facilitates researchers and physicians to browse, search, or download these multimorbidities ( https:\/\/multimorbidity.comp-sysbio.org ).Multimorbidities greatly increase the global health burdens, but the landscapes of their genetic risks have not been systematically investigated.We used the hospital inpatient data of 385,335 patients in the UK Biobank to investigate the multimorbid relations among 439 common diseases. Post-GWAS analyses were performed to identify multimorbidity shared genetic risks at the genomic loci, network, as well as overall genetic architecture levels. We conducted network decomposition for the networks of genetically interpretable multimorbidities to detect the hub diseases and the involved molecules and functions in each module.","75":"Results demonstrated a high prevalence of musculoskeletal discomfort in the previous year and a considerable number of professionals with residual fatigue. There was a substantial portion of workers with moderate work ability and requiring attention in the medium term.Cross-sectional study with professionals from a medium-sized public hospital. The Nordic symptom questionnaire, the work ability index, and the need for recovery scale (fatigue) were used. Data were analyzed descriptively and inferential tests were applied in order to verify the association of fatigue and work ability, and compare the fatigue among sectors analyzed.To evaluate the musculoskeletal discomfort, work ability and residual fatigue in nursing professionals working in the hospital setting.Participation of 110 professionals in the study. A total of 86.24% of workers reported musculoskeletal discomfort, with a higher prevalence in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine. Approximately 43% of professionals presented residual fatigue. There was a significant association between fatigue and reduction of work ability (p<0.003), as well as association between younger age and greater fatigue (p<0.03).","76":"It is important to understand how biodiversity, including that of rare species, affects ecosystem function. Here, we consider this question with regard to pollination. Studies of pollination function have typically focused on pollination of single plant species, or average pollination across plants, and typically find that pollination depends on a few common species. Here, we used data from 11 plant-bee visitation networks in New Jersey, USA, to ask whether the number of functionally important bee species changes as we consider function separately for each plant species in increasingly diverse plant communities. Using rarefaction analysis, we found the number of important bee species increased with the number of plant species. Overall, 2.5 to 7.6 times more bee species were important at the community scale, relative to the average plant species in the same community. This effect did not asymptote in any of our datasets, suggesting that even greater bee biodiversity is needed in real-world systems. Lastly, on average across plant communities, 25% of bee species that were important at the community scale were also numerically rare within their network, making this study one of the strongest empirical demonstrations to date of the functional importance of rare species.","77":" is calculated to be approximately between 1 and 3. The results demonstrate that asymptomatic transmission has a significant impact compared to symptomatic transmission in the disease outbreak. Outcomes of this study will contribute to setting an effective control strategy for the COVID-19 outbreak.","78":"Simulations underscored the importance of sporulation\/germination patterns in determining pathogenicity and transmission. All recommended regimens for recurring CDI tested were effective in reducing risk of an additional recurrence. Most modified regimens were still effective even after reducing the duration or dosage of vancomycin. However, the effectiveness of treatment varied by ribotype.Current CDI vancomycin regimen for treating recurrent cases should be studied further to better balance associated risks and benefits.We created a compartmental in-host mathematical model of CDI, composed of vegetative cells, toxins, and spores, to explore whether sporulation and germination have an impact on recurrence rates. We also simulated the effectiveness of three tapered\/pulsed vancomycin regimens by ribotype.Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a significant nosocomial infection worldwide, that recurs in as many as 35% of infections. Risk of CDI recurrence varies by ribotype, which also vary in sporulation and germination rates. Whether sporulation\/germination mediate risk of recurrence and effectiveness of treatment of recurring CDI remains unclear. We aim to assess the role of sporulation\/germination patterns on risk of recurrence, and the relative effectiveness of the recommended tapered\/pulsing regimens using an in silico model.","79":"Climate drives population dynamics through multiple mechanisms, which can lead to seemingly context-dependent effects of climate on natural populations. For climate-sensitive diseases, such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, climate appears to have opposing effects in different contexts. Here we show that a model, parameterized with laboratory measured climate-driven mosquito physiology, captures three key epidemic characteristics across ecologically and culturally distinct settings in Ecuador and Kenya: the number, timing, and duration of outbreaks. The model generates a range of disease dynamics consistent with observed Aedes aegypti abundances and laboratory-confirmed arboviral incidence with variable accuracy (28-85% for vectors, 44-88% for incidence). The model predicted vector dynamics better in sites with a smaller proportion of young children in the population, lower mean temperature, and homes with piped water and made of cement. Models with limited calibration that robustly capture climate-virus relationships can help guide intervention efforts and climate change disease projections.","80":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally, with >365,000 cases in California as of 17 July 2020. We investigated the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Northern California from late January to mid-March 2020, using samples from 36 patients spanning nine counties and the Grand Princess cruise ship. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the cryptic introduction of at least seven different SARS-CoV-2 lineages into California, including epidemic WA1 strains associated with Washington state, with lack of a predominant lineage and limited transmission among communities. Lineages associated with outbreak clusters in two counties were defined by a single base substitution in the viral genome. These findings support contact tracing, social distancing, and travel restrictions to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in California and other states.","81":"This study uses county-level surveillance data to systematically analyze geographic variation and clustering of persons living with diagnosed HIV (PLWH) in the southern United States in 2011. Clusters corresponding to large metropolitan areas - including Miami, Atlanta, and Baltimore - had HIV prevalence rates higher (p\u2009<\u2009.001) than the regional rate. Regression analysis within the counties included in these clusters determined that race was a significant indicator for PLWH. These results provide a general picture of the distribution of PLWH in the southern United States at the county level and provide insights for identifying local geographic areas with a high number of PLWH, as well as subpopulations that may have an increased risk of infection.","82":"We used in vivo confocal microscopy to compare the effects of inflammation in experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN), a model of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), on mitochondrial function and transport in large- and small-diameter axons. We have compared mitochondrial function and transport in vivo in (i) healthy axons, (ii) axons affected by experimental autoimmune neuritis, and (iii) axons in which mitochondria were focally damaged by laser induced photo-toxicity.Small-diameter, myelinated axons are selectively susceptible to dysfunction in several inflammatory PNS and CNS diseases, resulting in pain and degeneration, but the mechanism is not known.The data show that neuroinflammation, in common with photo-toxic damage, induces depolarization and fragmentation of axonal mitochondria, which remain immobile at the site of damage. The damaged, immobile mitochondria can \"plug\" myelinated, small-diameter axons so that successful mitochondrial transport is prevented, depleting the distal axon of functioning mitochondria. Our observations may explain the selective vulnerability of small-diameter axons to dysfunction and degeneration in a number of neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders. concentration. In large-diameter axons, healthy mitochondria were found to move into the damaged area bypassing the dysfunctional mitochondria, re-populating the damaged segment of the axon. However, in small-diameter axons, the depolarized mitochondria appeared to \"plug\" the axon, obstructing, sometimes completely, the incoming (mainly anterograde) transport of mitochondria. Over time (~\u20092\u00a0h), the transported, functional mitochondria accumulated at the obstruction, and the distal part of the small-diameter axons became depleted of functional mitochondria.","83":"\u00a029 m) and an equivalent increase in the clustering area of elevated disease odds by 342%. These differences could have important consequences for control efforts. Correct practice of graphical hypothesis testing of no clustering and clustering range estimation of the tau statistic are illustrated in the online Graphical abstract. We advocate proper implementation of this useful statistic, ultimately to reduce inaccuracies in control policy decisions made during disease clustering analysis.","84":"Motivated by the importance of service quality in nowadays customer business environment, we focus on inventory optimization under probabilistic service level constraints , namely, the \u03b1 service level (also known as the ready rate) or the \u03b2 service level (also known as the fill rate). Under service level constraints, we consider two canonical stochastic inventory models: (i) the classical inventory control model with backlogging and (ii) the remanufacturing inventory control model with random product returns. The random demands could be non\u2010stationary, evolving and correlated over time. For each model, we first establish the optimality of generalized base\u2010stock policies, and then propose a new approximation algorithm that admits a worst\u2010case performance guarantee of 2. The core concept developed in this study is called the delayed forced holding and production cost , which is proven effective in dealing with service level constrained inventory systems. We also provide an efficient heuristic algorithm for the multi\u2010item inventory system. Our extensive computational experiments show that the proposed algorithms perform within 2% of optimality.","85":"Further spread of 2019-nCoV within China and international exportation is likely to occur. All countries, especially vulnerable regions, should be prepared for efforts to contain the 2019-nCoV infection.A series of domestic and international travel network-based connectivity and risk analyses were performed, by using de-identified and aggregated mobile phone data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports.The cordon sanitaire of Wuhan is likely to have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving the city before Lunar New Year (LNY), with travellers departing into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China. We estimated that 59,912 air passengers, of which 834 (95% UI: 478 - 1349) had 2019-nCoV infection, travelled from Wuhan to 382 cities outside of mainland China during the two weeks prior to Wuhan's lockdown. The majority of these cities were in Asia, but major hubs in Europe, the US and Australia were also prominent, with strong correlation seen between predicted importation risks and reported cases. Because significant spread has already occurred, a large number of airline travellers (3.3 million under the scenario of 75% travel reduction from normal volumes) may be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April, 2020 to effectively limit spread beyond its current extent.A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan City, China, at the end of 2019 and has caused an outbreak of human-to-human transmission with a Public Health Emergency of International Concern declared by the World Health Organization on January 30, 2020.We aimed to estimate the potential risk and geographic range of Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread within and beyond China from January through to April, 2020.","86":"A total of 289 participants were recruited (including 257 participants with CGM data within the last 3 months). Of these, 25.6% experienced at least one severe hypoglycemic episode in the last 6 months, and 13.6% presented with \u22651% of time in level 2 hypoglycemia on CGMs. Reporting beliefs about prioritizing hyperglycemia avoidance was associated with severe hypoglycemia development (P < 0.001), while having beliefs of minimal concerns for hypoglycemia was associated with spending \u22651% of time in level 2 hypoglycemia (P = 0.038).This study aimed to 1) identify the frequency of severe and level 2 hypoglycemia presenting in individuals with type 1 diabetes using continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMs), including those with concomitant closed-loop insulin pumps, in a clinical practice setting, and; 2) evaluate the impact of beliefs around hypoglycemia in the development of severe and level 2 hypoglycemia in this population.Despite the use of advanced diabetes technologies, severe and level 2 hypoglycemia continues to occur in individuals with type 1 diabetes and high hypoglycemia risks. Human factors, including beliefs around hypoglycemia, may continue to impact the effectiveness of glucose self-management.A cross-sectional survey study in adults with type 1 diabetes using CGMs >6 months was conducted at a large tertiary academic center. Participant demographics, 6-month severe hypoglycemia history, hypoglycemia beliefs (with the Attitude to Awareness of Hypoglycemia questionnaire), and 4-week CGM glucose data were collected. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the presentation of severe and level 2 hypoglycemia and identify associated risk factors.","87":"Early and accurate detection of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infection in live pigs is a critical component to measure the success of disease eradication strategies. However, the imperfect sensitivity of in vivo diagnostic tools, change in sensitivity over the course of infection, and expected low prevalence level at the end of an eradication program create a challenging diagnostic scenario. Here, the individual and pool sensitivities for detection of M. hyopneumoniae during the chronic phase of infection was determined using deep tracheal catheter samples, the in vivo sample type with the highest reported diagnostic sensitivity. Fifty samples from known infected pigs collected at 113 days post-M. hyopneumoniae intra-tracheal inoculation, were diluted in known negative samples to form pools of 1:3 and 1:5. Samples were tested for M. hyopneumoniae by a species-specific PCR. Ninety-eight percent (49\/50) of individual samples, 84 % (42\/50) of pools of 1:3, and 82 % (41\/50) of 1:5 were detected positive for M. hyopneumoniae. To apply the sensitivity estimates for detection of M. hyopneumoniae in a low prevalence scenario, sample sizes with associated sample collection costs were calculated for individual and pooled testing using algorithms within the program EpiTools One-Stage Freedom Analyses. Assumptions included a \u226595 % population sensitivity, infinite population size, prevalence levels of \u22650.5 %, \u22651 %, \u22652 %, \u22653 %, \u22654 %, or \u22655 %, 100 % specificity, along with the mean and lower confidence limit of the individual or pool sensitivity for each pool size, when appropriate. For instance, following completion of a herd eradication program, if a low risk approach is targeted, sample size estimates for \u22652 % prevalence using the lower limit of the diagnostic or pool sensitivity 95 %CI may be followed. If samples were to be tested individually, 167 individuals would be sampled at a cost of 6,012 USD. If pooled by 3, 213 would be sampled (testing cost 3,266 USD), and for pools of 5, 220 individuals would be sampled (testing cost 2,464 USD). Population sensitivity was also calculated for a range of testing scenarios. Our study indicated that pooling samples by 3 or 5 was a cost-effective method for M. hyopneumoniae detection in low prevalence scenarios. Cost-effective detection was evidenced despite the increased sample collection costs associated with large sample sizes in order to offset decreased testing sensitivity attributable to pooling. The post-eradication sample collection scheme, combined with pooling, suggested lower cost options than individual sampling for testing to be applied at the end of an eradication program, without significantly compromising the likelihood of detection.","88":"Influenza is a yearly recurrent disease that has the potential to become a pandemic. An effective biosurveillance system is required for early detection of the disease. In our previous studies, we have shown that electronic Emergency Department (ED) free-text reports can be of value to improve influenza detection in real time. This paper studies seven machine learning (ML) classifiers for influenza detection, compares their diagnostic capabilities against an expert-built influenza Bayesian classifier, and evaluates different ways of handling missing clinical information from the free-text reports. We identified 31,268 ED reports from 4 hospitals between 2008 and 2011 to form two different datasets: training (468 cases, 29,004 controls), and test (176 cases and 1620 controls). We employed Topaz, a natural language processing (NLP) tool, to extract influenza-related findings and to encode them into one of three values: Acute, Non-acute, and Missing. Results show that all ML classifiers had areas under ROCs (AUC) ranging from 0.88 to 0.93, and performed significantly better than the expert-built Bayesian model. Missing clinical information marked as a value of missing (not missing at random) had a consistently improved performance among 3 (out of 4) ML classifiers when it was compared with the configuration of not assigning a value of missing (missing completely at random). The case\/control ratios did not affect the classification performance given the large number of training cases. Our study demonstrates ED reports in conjunction with the use of ML and NLP with the handling of missing value information have a great potential for the detection of infectious diseases.","89":"Ecological and social factors influence individual movement and group membership decisions, which ultimately determine how animal groups adjust their behavior in spatially and temporally heterogeneous environments. The mechanisms behind these behavioral adjustments can be better understood by studying the relationship between association and space use patterns of groups and how these change over time. We examined the socio-spatial patterns of adult individuals in a free-ranging group of spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi), a species with high fission-fusion dynamics. Data comprised 4916 subgroup scans collected during 325 days throughout a 20-month period and was used to evaluate changes from fruit-scarce to fruit-abundant periods in individual core-area size, subgroup size and two types of association measures: spatial (core-area overlap) and spatio-temporal (occurrence in the same subgroup) associations. We developed a 3-level analysis framework to distinguish passive associations, where individuals are mostly brought together by resources of common interest, from active association, where individuals actively seek or avoid certain others. Results indicated a more concentrated use of space, increased individual gregariousness and higher spatio-temporal association rates in the fruit-abundant seasons, as is compatible with an increase in passive associations. Nevertheless, results also suggested active associations in all the periods analyzed, although associations differed across seasons. In particular, females seem to actively avoid males, perhaps prompted by an increased probability of random encounters among individuals, resulting from the contraction of individual core areas. Our framework proved useful in investigating the interplay between ecological and social constraints and how these constraints can influence individual ranging and grouping decisions in spider monkeys, and possibly other species with high fission-fusion dynamics. ","90":"The proposed adjustment refines the reproduction number estimates obtained with the current EpiEstim implementation by producing improved, more precise estimates earlier than with the original method. This has relevant public health implications.We propose a debiasing procedure which utilises a linear exponential growth model to infer unobserved initial generations of infections and apply it to EpiEstim. We assess the performance of our adjustment using simulated data, considering different levels of transmissibility and reporting rates. We also apply the proposed correction to SARS-CoV-2 incidence data reported in Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.Estimating the transmissibility of infectious diseases is key to inform situational awareness and for response planning. Several methods tend to overestimate the basic (R0) and effective (Rt) reproduction numbers during the initial phases of an epidemic. The reasons driving the observed bias are unknown. In this work we explore the impact of incomplete observations and underreporting of the first generations of infections during the initial epidemic phase.In all simulation scenarios, our adjustment outperforms the original EpiEstim method. The proposed correction reduces the systematic bias and the quantification of uncertainty is more precise, as better coverage of the true R0 values is achieved with tighter credible intervals. When applied to real world data, the proposed adjustment produces basic reproduction number estimates which closely match the estimates obtained in other studies while making use of a minimal amount of data.","91":"At their current price premium, the annual cost of each solar refrigerator is 132% more than each electric refrigerator at the district level and 241% more at health facilities. Solar refrigerators provided savings over electric refrigerators when one-day electrical outages occurred more than five times per year at either the district level or the health facilities, even when the electric refrigerator holdover time exceeded the duration of the outage. Two-day outages occurring more than three times per year at the district level or more than twice per year at the health facilities also caused solar refrigerators to be cost saving. Lowering the annual cost of a solar refrigerator to 75% more than an electric refrigerator allowed solar refrigerators to be cost saving at either level when one-day outages occurred more than once per year, or when two-day outages occurred more than once per year at the district level or even once per year at the health facilities.Gavi recommends solar refrigerators for vaccine storage in areas with less than eight hours of electricity per day, and WHO guidelines are more conservative. The question remains: Can solar refrigerators provide value where electrical outages are less frequent?Using a HERMES-generated computational model of the Mozambique routine immunization supply chain, we simulated the use of solar versus electric mains-powered refrigerators (hereafter referred to as \"electric refrigerators\") at different locations in the supply chain under various circumstances.Our study supports WHO and Gavi guidelines. In fact, solar refrigerators may provide savings in total cost per dose administered over electrical refrigerators when electrical outages are less frequent. Our study identified the frequency and duration at which electrical outages need to occur for solar refrigerators to provide savings in total cost per dose administered over electric refrigerators at different solar refrigerator prices.","92":"Coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley fever, is a disease caused by the fungal pathogen Coccidioides. Unfortunately, patients are often misdiagnosed with bacterial pneumonia leading to inappropriate antibiotic treatment. Soil bacteria B. subtilis-like species exhibits antagonistic properties against Coccidioides in vitro; however, the antagonistic capabilities of host microbiota against Coccidioides are unexplored. We sought to examine the potential of the tracheal and intestinal microbiomes to inhibit the growth of Coccidioides in vitro. We hypothesized that an uninterrupted lawn of microbiota obtained from antibiotic-free mice would inhibit the growth of Coccidioides while partial in vitro depletion through antibiotic disk diffusion assays would allow a niche for fungal growth. We observed that the microbiota grown on 2xGYE (GYE) and CNA w\/ 5% sheep's blood agar (5%SB-CNA) inhibited the growth of Coccidioides, but that grown on chocolate agar does not. Partial depletion of the microbiota through antibiotic disk diffusion revealed that microbiota depletion leads to diminished inhibition and comparable growth of Coccidioides growth to controls. To characterize the bacteria grown and narrow down potential candidates contributing to the inhibition of Coccidioides, 16s rRNA sequencing of tracheal and intestinal agar cultures and murine lung extracts was performed. The identity of host bacteria that may be responsible for this inhibition was revealed. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of the host microbiota to inhibit the growth of Coccidioides in vitro and suggest that an altered microbiome through antibiotic treatment could negatively impact effective fungal clearance and allow a niche for fungal growth in vivo.","93":"From these observations, we hypothesize that policies restricting alcohol and tobacco availability seem to enable some individuals to reduce their consumption. However, these appear to have little effect on the volume of AA consumed among individuals with more harmful patterns of drinking in the absence of additional behavior change interventions.South Africa temporarily banned alcohol and tobacco sales for about 20 weeks during the COVID-19 lockdown. We described changes in alcohol and tobacco consumption after implementation of these restrictions among a small number of participants in a tuberculosis treatment cohort.The timeline follow-back procedure and F\u00e4gerstrom test for nicotine dependence was used to collect monthly alcohol and tobacco use information. We report changes in heavy drinking days (HDD), average amount of absolute alcohol (AA) consumed per drinking day, and cigarettes smoked daily during the alcohol and tobacco ban compared to use prior to the ban.Of the 61 participants for whom we have pre-ban and within-ban alcohol use information, 17 (27.9%) reported within-ban alcohol use. On average, participants reported one less HDD per fortnight (interquartile range (IQR): -4, 1), but their amount of AA consumed increased by 37.4 g per drinking occasion (IQR: -65.9 g, 71.0 g). Of 53 participants who reported pre-ban tobacco use, 17 (32.1%) stopped smoking during the ban. The number of participants smoking >10 cigarettes per day decreased from 8 to 1.","94":" infection using a natural history submodel. We discuss the ABM's potential to detect network areas where disease risk is high; simulate and evaluate interventions to protect public health; adapt to other geographic locations and healthcare-associated infections, including emerging pathogens; and meaningfully translate results to public health practitioners, healthcare providers, and policymakers.","95":"Equine Infectious Anemia Virus (EIAV) is an important infection in equids, and its similarity to HIV creates hope for a potential vaccine. We analyze a within-host model of EIAV infection with antibody and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. In this model, the stability of the biologically relevant endemic equilibrium, characterized by the coexistence of long-term antibody and CTL levels, relies upon a balance between CTL and antibody growth rates, which is needed to ensure persistent CTL levels. We determine the model parameter ranges at which CTL and antibody proliferation rates are simultaneously most influential in leading the system towards coexistence and can be used to derive a mathematical relationship between CTL and antibody production rates to explore the bifurcation curve that leads to coexistence. We employ Latin hypercube sampling and least squares to find the parameter ranges that equally divide the endemic and boundary equilibria. We then examine this relationship numerically via a local sensitivity analysis of the parameters. Our analysis is consistent with previous results showing that an intervention (such as a vaccine) intended to control a persistent viral infection with both immune responses should moderate the antibody response to allow for stimulation of the CTL response. Finally, we show that the CTL production rate can entirely determine the long-term outcome, regardless of the effect of other parameters, and we provide the conditions for this result in terms of the identified ranges for all model parameters.","96":"Forecasting influenza activity in tropical and subtropical regions, such as Hong Kong, is challenging due to irregular seasonality and high variability. We develop a diverse set of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning approaches to forecast influenza activity in Hong Kong 0 to 8 weeks ahead, leveraging a unique multi-year surveillance record spanning 32 epidemics from 1998 to 2019. We consider a simple average ensemble (SAE) of the top two individual models, and develop an adaptive weight blending ensemble (AWBE) that dynamically updates model contribution. All models outperform the baseline constant incidence model, reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) by 23%-29% and weighted interval score (WIS) by 25%-31% for 8-week ahead forecasts. The SAE model performed similarly to individual models, while the AWBE model reduces RMSE by 52% and WIS by 53%, outperforming individual models for forecasts in different epidemic trends (growth, plateau, decline) and during both winter and summer seasons. Using the post-COVID data (2023-2024) as another test period, the AWBE model still reduces RMSE by 39% and WIS by 45%. Our framework contributes to comparing and benchmarking models in ensemble forecasts, enhancing evidence for synthesizing multiple models in disease forecasting for geographies with irregular influenza seasonality.","97":"With the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and in the absence of evidence-informed guidance, state and local policymakers have had to put policies in place quickly, with little evidence to support their choices, and with little consideration as to the potentially serious trade-offs that such policies could introduce. Thus, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive and systematic assessment of potential public health interventions to address COVID-19 and when to relax them. This document describes the interdisciplinary and multisectoral approach that RAND researchers used to develop the COVID-19 Decision Support Tool, which is designed to fill that need.","98":"In the context of multi-drug resistance, there are several considerations for implementing malaria prophylaxis: the need to target forest goers who are at-risk with a clear period of exposure, to ensure continued use of vector control measures and adherence to prophylactic anti-malarials, and to adopt an evidence-based approach to determine an appropriate regimen. Beyond addressing current intervention challenges and managing malaria incidence in low-transmission setting, it is crucial to keep malaria services available and accessible at the village level especially in areas home to highly mobile populations.Across the Greater Mekong Subregion, malaria remains a dangerous infectious disease, particularly for people who visit forested areas where residual transmission continues. Because vector control measures offer incomplete protection to forest goers, chemoprophylaxis has been suggested as a potential supplementary measure for malaria prevention and control. To implement prophylaxis effectively, additional information is needed to understand forest goers' activities and their willingness to use malaria prevention measures, including prophylaxis, and how it could be delivered in communities. Drawing on in-depth interviews with forest goers and stakeholders, this article examines the potential acceptability and implementation challenges of malaria prophylaxis for forest goers in northeast Thailand.In-depth interviews were conducted with forest goers (n = 11) and stakeholders (n = 16) including healthcare workers, community leaders, and policymakers. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and coded using NVivo, employing an inductive and deductive approach, for thematic analysis.Forest goers were well aware of their (elevated) malaria risk and reported seeking care for malaria from local health care providers. Forest goers and community members have a close relationship with the forest but are not a homogenous group: their place and time-at-risk varied according to their activities and length of stay in the forest. Among stakeholders, the choice and cost of anti-malarial prophylactic regimen-its efficacy, length and complexity, number of tablets, potential side effects, and long-term impact on users-were key considerations for its feasibility. They also expressed concern about adherence to the preventive therapy and potential difficulty treating malaria patients with the same regimen. Prophylaxis was considered a low priority in areas with perceived accessible health system and approaching malaria elimination.","99":"The benefits of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs rely on completing follow-up colonoscopy when a noncolonoscopy test is abnormal and on quality of colonoscopy screening as measured by the endoscopists' adenoma detection rate. Existing data demonstrate substantially lower follow-up colonoscopy rates and adenoma detection rate for Black Americans than White Americans. However, the contributions of racial differences in follow-up colonoscopy and adenoma detection rate on CRC outcomes have not been rigorously evaluated.We used established and validated CRC-Adenoma Incidence and Mortality (CRC-AIM) model as our analysis platform, with inputs from published literature that report lower follow-up colonoscopy rates and adenoma detection rate in Black adults compared with White adults (15% and 10% lower, respectively). We simulated screening with annual fecal immunochemical test, triennial multitarget stool DNA, and colonoscopy every 10\u2009years between ages 45 and 75 years using real-world utilization of the screening modalities vs no screening. We reported lifetime outcomes per 1000 Black adults.This modeling study predicts eliminating racial differences in follow-up colonoscopy rates, and quality of screening colonoscopy would substantially reduce Black-White disparities in CRC incidence and mortality.Elimination of Black-White disparities in follow-up colonoscopy rates would reduce CRC incidence and mortality by 5.2% and 9.3%, respectively, and improve life-years gained with screening by 3.4%. Elimination of Black-White disparities in endoscopists' adenoma detection rate would reduce CRC incidence and mortality by 9.4% and improve life-years gained by 3.7%. Elimination of both disparities would reduce CRC incidence and mortality by 14.6% and 18.7%, respectively, and improve life-years gained by 7.1%.","100":"As the Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) started to spread rapidly in the state of Ohio, the Ecology, Epidemiology and Population Health (EEPH) program within the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI) at The Ohio State University (OSU) took the initiative to offer epidemic modeling and decision analytics support to the Ohio Department of Health (ODH). This paper describes the methodology used by the OSU\/IDI response modeling team to predict statewide cases of new infections as well as potential hospital burden in the state. The methodology has two components: (1) A Dynamical Survival Analysis (DSA)-based statistical method to perform parameter inference, statewide prediction and uncertainty quantification. (2) A geographic component that down-projects statewide predicted counts to potential hospital burden across the state. We demonstrate the overall methodology with publicly available data. A Python implementation of the methodology is also made publicly available. This manuscript was submitted as part of a theme issue on \"Modelling COVID-19 and Preparedness for Future Pandemics\".","101":"To develop a natural language processing system that solves both clinical concept extraction and relation extraction in a unified prompt-based machine reading comprehension (MRC) architecture with good generalizability for cross-institution applications.The proposed MRC models achieve state-of-the-art performance for clinical concept and relation extraction on the 2 benchmark datasets, outperforming previous non-MRC transformer models. GatorTron-MRC achieves the best strict and lenient F1-scores for concept extraction, outperforming previous deep learning models on the 2 datasets by 1%-3% and 0.7%-1.3%, respectively. For end-to-end relation extraction, GatorTron-MRC and BERT-MIMIC-MRC achieve the best F1-scores, outperforming previous deep learning models by 0.9%-2.4% and 10%-11%, respectively. For cross-institution evaluation, GatorTron-MRC outperforms traditional GatorTron by 6.4% and 16% for the 2 datasets, respectively. The proposed method is better at handling nested\/overlapped concepts, extracting relations, and has good portability for cross-institute applications. Our clinical MRC package is publicly available at https:\/\/github.com\/uf-hobi-informatics-lab\/ClinicalTransformerMRC.We formulate both clinical concept extraction and relation extraction using a unified prompt-based MRC architecture and explore state-of-the-art transformer models. We compare our MRC models with existing deep learning models for concept extraction and end-to-end relation extraction using 2 benchmark datasets developed by the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) challenge (medications and adverse drug events) and the 2022 n2c2 challenge (relations of social determinants of health [SDoH]). We also evaluate the transfer learning ability of the proposed MRC models in a cross-institution setting. We perform error analyses and examine how different prompting strategies affect the performance of MRC models.","102":"Cohort studies, randomized trials, and post-licensure studies have reported reduced natural and vaccine-derived protection against rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) in low- and middle-income countries. While susceptibility of children to rotavirus is known to vary within and between settings, implications for estimation of immune protection are not well understood. We sought to re-estimate naturally-acquired protection against rotavirus infection and RVGE, and to understand how differences in susceptibility among children impacted estimates. We re-analyzed data from studies conducted in Mexico City, Mexico and Vellore, India. Cumulatively, 573 rotavirus-unvaccinated children experienced 1418 rotavirus infections and 371 episodes of RVGE over 17,636 child-months. We developed a model that characterized susceptibility to rotavirus infection and RVGE among children, accounting for aspects of the natural history of rotavirus and differences in transmission rates between settings. We tested whether model-generated susceptibility measurements were associated with demographic and anthropometric factors, and with the severity of RVGE symptoms. We identified greater variation in susceptibility to rotavirus infection and RVGE in Vellore than in Mexico City. In both cohorts, susceptibility to rotavirus infection and RVGE were associated with male sex, lower birth weight, lower maternal education, and having fewer siblings; within Vellore, susceptibility was also associated with lower socioeconomic status. Children who were more susceptible to rotavirus also experienced higher rates of rotavirus-negative diarrhea, and higher risk of moderate-to-severe symptoms when experiencing RVGE. Simulations suggested that discrepant estimates of naturally-acquired immunity against RVGE can be attributed, in part, to between-setting differences in susceptibility of children, but result primarily from the interaction of transmission rates with age-dependent risk for infections to cause RVGE. We found that more children in Vellore than in Mexico City belong to a high-risk group for rotavirus infection and RVGE, and demonstrate that unmeasured individual- and age-dependent susceptibility may influence estimates of naturally-acquired immune protection against RVGE.","103":"Regular rapid testing can provide twofold benefilts: identifying infectious individuals and providing positive tests sufficiently early during infection that treatment with antivirals can effectively inhibit development of severe disease. Here, we provide a quantitative illustration of the extent of nirmatrelvir-associated treatment benefits that are accrued among high-risk populations when rapid tests are administered at various intervals. Strategies for which tests are administered more frequently are associated with greater reductions in the risk of hospitalization, with weighted risk ratios\u00a0for testing every other day to once every 2 weeks ranging from 0.17 (95% CI: 0.11-0.28) to 0.77 (95% CI: 0.69-0.83) and correspondingly, higher proportions of the infected population benefiting from treatment, ranging from 0.26 (95% CI: 0.18-0.34) to 0.92 (95% CI: 0.80-0.98), respectively. Importantly, reduced treatment delays, coupled with increased test and treatment coverage, have a critical influence on average treatment benefits, confirming the significance of access.","104":"The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) imposed a substanal health burden in mainland China and remains a global epidemic threat. Our objectives are to assess the case fatality risk (CFR) among CO VID-19 patients detected in mainland China, stratified by clinical category and age group.We collected individual information on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases from publicly available official sources from December 29, 2019 to February 23, 2020. We explored the risk factors associated with mortality. We used methods accounting for right-censoring and survival analyses to estimatethe CFR among detected cases.Of 12,863 cases reported outside Hubei, we obtained individual records for 9,651 cases, including 62 deaths and 1,449 discharged cases. The deceased were significantly older than discharged cases (median age: 77 vs 39 years, p<0.001). 58% (36\/62) were male. Older age (OR 1.18 per year; 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.22), being male (OR 2.02; 95% CI: 1.02 to 4.03), and being treated in less developed economic regions (e.g., West and Northeast vs. East, OR 3.93; 95 %Cl:1.74 to 8.85) were mortality risk factors. The estimated CFR was 0.89-1.24% among all cases. The fatality risk among critical patients was 2-fold higher than that among severe and critical patients, and 24-fold higher than that among moderate, severe and critical patients.Our estimates of CFR based on laboratory-confirmed cases ascertained outside of Hubei suggest that COVID-19 is not as severe as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, but more similar to the mortality risk of 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in hospitalized patients. The fatality risk of COVID-19 is higher in males and increases with age. Our study improves the severity assessment of the ongoing epidemic and can inform the COVID-19 outbreak response in China and beyond.","105":"Based on trends occurring after the most recent joinpoint inflection point, overall cancer incidence increased by 1.15% (95% CI = 1.01% to 1.28%) per year in 25- to 39-year-old women and by 0.46% (95% CI = 0.17% to 0.75%) per year in 25- to 39-year-old men; APCs were of much lower magnitude in the older age groups (eg, 70- to 84-year-old women APC = -0.31%, 95% CI = -0.42% to -0.20%). We forecasted that overall cancer incidence will increase by an additional 11% by 2030 in 25- to 39-year-old women, and by an additional 12% in 25- to 39-year-old men. Ten of the 18 cancers assessed in 25- to 39-year-old women and 7 of the 16 cancers in 25- to 39-year-old men have been statistically significantly increasing over time. We found that the increase in incidence for young adults is stage specific for some cancers (eg, only nonlocalized breast cancer has increased in 25- to 39-year-old women).We used US population-based data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program to obtain overall and site-specific cancer incidence rates by sex and age group. We individually analyzed cancer sites with an incidence rate of at least 5 per 100\u00a0000 in 2015, accounting for greater than 90% of all cancer diagnoses. We estimated annual percent changes (APCs) using segment log-linear regression performed with joinpoint software; multiple permutation testing was used to identify inflection points. We forecasted overall cancer incidence through 2030 using age-period-cohort regression models.Cancer incidence is increasing in young adults, particularly in young women.Studies have documented a temporal increase in incidence for several cancers in US young adults aged 25 to 39-years, including noncardia gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, and distant-stage breast cancer. To further characterize trends in young adults, we assessed age-specific and stage-specific incidence trends from 1975 to 2015, overall (all malignant cancers combined), and for 18 and 16 cancer sites in women and men, respectively.","106":"In understanding the dynamics of the spread of an infectious disease, it is important to understand how a town's place in a network of towns within a region will impact how the disease spreads to that town and from that town. In this article, we take a model for the spread of an infectious disease in a single town and scale it up to simulate a region containing multiple towns. The model is validated by looking at how adding additional towns and commuters influences the outbreak in a single town. We then look at how the centrality of a town within a network influences the outbreak. Our main finding is that the commuters coming into a town have a greater effect on whether an outbreak will spread to a town than the commuters going out. The findings on centrality of a town and how it influences an outbreak could potentially be used to help influence future policy and intervention strategies such as school closure policies.","107":"Male adaptations that limit sperm competition include guarding females, applying mating plugs and chemically reducing the attractiveness or receptivity of females. In many web-building spider species, females attract males with silk-borne volatile pheromones. In widow spiders (Latrodectus, 30 species), the courting male often engages in web reduction behaviour during which he excises and bundles sections of the female's web and wraps them with his own silk. Hypothesized functions of this widespread behaviour include sexual communication (e.g. through dissemination of male sex pheromone) and\/or decreasing the female's attractiveness to rivals. The latter function was previously demonstrated in a single spider species, Neriene litigiosa, but the extent to which web reduction may decrease male\u0096male competition has never been quantified in the field. In a dense population of western black widows, Latrodectus hesperus, we ran mate attraction experiments to test the hypothesis that web reduction and\/or male silk addition decrease web attractiveness to potential rivals. Webs reduced by males attracted three times fewer males than intact webs; webs with a similar proportion of silk experimentally removed attracted as many males as intact webs. However, the experimental addition of male silk did not affect the attractiveness of intact webs. We conclude that web reduction in black widows limits male\u0096male competition by reducing the attraction of rival males to females' webs. This effect is probably mediated through targeted excision of pheromone-laden silk by courting males, possibly in combination with the male's silk forming a physical barrier to pheromone emission.","108":"Using geo-referenced case data, we present spatial and spatio-temporal cluster analyses of the early spread of the 2013-2015 chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in Dominica, an island in the Caribbean. Spatial coordinates of the locations of the first 417 reported cases observed between December 15th, 2013 and March 11th, 2014, were captured using the Global Positioning System (GPS). We observed a preponderance of female cases, which has been reported for CHIKV outbreaks in other regions. We also noted statistically significant spatial and spatio-temporal clusters in highly populated areas and observed major clusters prior to implementation of intensive vector control programs suggesting early vector control measures, and education had an impact on the spread of the CHIKV epidemic in Dominica. A dynamical identification of clusters can lead to local assessment of risk and provide opportunities for targeted control efforts for nations experiencing CHIKV outbreaks. ","109":"The fascinating ability of humans to modify the linguistic input and \"create\" a language has been widely discussed. In the work of Newport and colleagues, it has been demonstrated that both children and adults have some ability to process inconsistent linguistic input and \"improve\" it by making it more consistent. In Hudson Kam and Newport (2009), artificial miniature language acquisition from an inconsistent source was studied. It was shown that (i) children are better at language regularization than adults and that (ii) adults can also regularize, depending on the structure of the input. In this paper we create a learning algorithm of the reinforcement-learning type, which exhibits patterns reported in Hudson Kam and Newport (2009) and suggests a way to explain them. It turns out that in order to capture the differences between children's and adults' learning patterns, we need to introduce a certain asymmetry in the learning algorithm. Namely, we have to assume that the reaction of the learners differs depending on whether or not the source's input coincides with the learner's internal hypothesis. We interpret this result in the context of a different reaction of children and adults to implicit, expectation-based evidence, positive or negative. We propose that a possible mechanism that contributes to the children's ability to regularize an inconsistent input is related to their heightened sensitivity to positive evidence rather than the (implicit) negative evidence. In our model, regularization comes naturally as a consequence of a stronger reaction of the children to evidence supporting their preferred hypothesis. In adults, their ability to adequately process implicit negative evidence prevents them from regularizing the inconsistent input, resulting in a weaker degree of regularization.","110":"Like many infectious diseases, there is no practical gold standard for diagnosing clinical visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Latent class modeling has been proposed to estimate a latent gold standard for identifying disease. These proposed models for VL have leveraged information from diagnostic tests with dichotomous serological and PCR assays, but have not employed continuous diagnostic test information.In this paper, we employ Bayesian latent class models to improve the identification of canine visceral leishmaniasis using the dichotomous PCR assay and the Dual Path Platform (DPP) serology test. The DPP test has historically been used as a dichotomous assay, but can also yield numerical information via the DPP reader. Using data collected from a cohort of hunting dogs across the United States, which were identified as having either negative or symptomatic disease, we evaluate the impact of including numerical DPP reader information as a proxy for immune response. We find that inclusion of DPP reader information allows us to illustrate changes in immune response as a function of age.Utilization of continuous DPP reader information can improve the correct discrimination between individuals that are negative for disease and those with clinical VL. These models provide a promising avenue for diagnostic testing in contexts with multiple, imperfect diagnostic tests. Specifically, they can easily be applied to human visceral leishmaniasis when diagnostic test results are available. Also, appropriate diagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis has important consequences for curtailing spread of disease to humans.","111":"We simulated a hypothetical bacterial STI spread through 4 representative network structures: random, community-structured, scale-free, and empirical. We simulated disease outcomes (prevalence, incidence, total infected person-months) and cost-effectiveness of 4 partner management strategies in each network structure: routine STI screening alone (no partner management), partner notification, expedited partner therapy, and contact tracing. We determined the optimal partner management strategy following a cost-effectiveness framework and varied key compliance parameters of partner management in sensitivity analysis.It is well established that network structure strongly influences infectious disease dynamics. However, little is known about how the network structure impacts the cost-effectiveness of disease control strategies. We evaluated partner management strategies to address bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as a case study to explore the influence of the network structure on the optimal disease management strategy.Our findings suggest that contact network structure matters in determining the optimal disease control strategy in infectious diseases. Information on a population's contact network structure may be valuable for informing optimal investment of limited resources.For the same average number of contacts and disease parameters in our setting, community-structured networks had the lowest incidence, prevalence, and total infected person-months, whereas scale-free networks had the highest without partner management. The highly connected individuals were more likely to be reinfected in scale-free networks than in the other network structures. The cost-effective partner management strategy depended on the network structures, the compliance in partner management, the willingness-to-pay threshold, and the rate of external force of infection.","112":"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease that is globally distributed and has the potential to cause very serious illness. Prior literature highlights the emergence and spread of VL is influenced by multiple factors, such as socioeconomic status, sanitation levels or animal and human reservoirs. The study aimed to retrospectively investigate the presence and infectiousness of VL in Rio Grande do Norte (RN), Brazil between 2007 and 2020. We applied a hierarchical Bayesian approach to estimate municipality-specific relative risk of VL across space and time. The results show evidence that lower socioeconomic status is connected to higher municipality-specific VL risk. Overall, estimates reveal spatially heterogeneous VL risks in RN, with a high probability that VL risk for municipalities within the West Potiguar mesoregion are more than double the expected VL risk. Additionally, given the data available, results indicate there is a high probability of increasing VL risk in the municipalities of Natal, Patu and Pau dos Ferros. These findings demonstrate opportunities for municipality-specific public health policy interventions and warrant future research on identifying epidemiological drivers in at-risk regions.","113":"To evaluate the accuracy of signs and symptoms for the diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis (ARS).We searched Medline to identify studies of outpatients with clinically suspected ARS and sufficient data reported to calculate the sensitivity and specificity. Of 1,649 studies initially identified, 17 met our inclusion criteria. Acute rhinosinusitis was diagnosed by any valid reference standard, whereas acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) was diagnosed by purulence on antral puncture or positive bacterial culture. We used bivariate meta-analysis to calculate summary estimates of test accuracy.Among patients with clinically suspected ARS, the prevalence of imaging confirmed ARS is 51% and ABRS is 31%. Clinical findings that best rule in ARS are purulent secretions in the middle meatus (positive likelihood ratio [LR+] 3.2) and the overall clinical impression (LR+ 3.0). The findings that best rule out ARS are the overall clinical impression (negative likelihood ratio [LR-] 0.37), normal transillumination (LR- 0.55), the absence of preceding respiratory tract infection (LR- 0.48), any nasal discharge (LR- 0.49), and purulent nasal discharge (LR- 0.54). Based on limited data, the overall clinical impression (LR+ 3.8, LR- 0.34), cacosmia (fetid odor on the breath) (LR+ 4.3, LR- 0.86) and pain in the teeth (LR+ 2.0, LR- 0.77) are the best predictors of ABRS. While several clinical decision rules have been proposed, none have been prospectively validated.Among patients with clinically suspected ARS, only about one-third have ABRS. The overall clinical impression, cacosmia, and pain in the teeth are the best predictors of ABRS. Clinical decision rules, including those incorporating C-reactive protein, and use of urine dipsticks are promising, but require prospective validation.","114":"Nontuberculous mycobacteria are ubiquitous environmental bacteria that frequently cause disease in persons with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). The risks for NTM infection vary geographically. Detection of high-risk areas is important for focusing prevention efforts. In this study, we apply five cluster detection methods to identify counties with high NTM infection risk. Four clusters were detected by at least three of the five methods, including twenty-five counties in five states. The geographic area and number of counties in each cluster depended upon the detection method used. Identifying these clusters supports future studies of environmental predictors of infection and will inform control and prevention efforts.","115":"We analysed the effectiveness of various non-pharmaceutical interventions in containing the 2022 Omicron outbreak in China. The results show that the Rapid Antigen Test contributed to containing the outbreak, reducing the reproduction number by 0.788 (95% CI:-0.306, 1.880) in studied cities.","116":"To address this gap, we will collect qualitative and quantitative data from eight study sites (encompassing both rural and urban settings) across Guatemala, India, Pakistan, and Mozambique. We will conduct focus group discussions and cognitive interviews to assess the feasibility and acceptability of our data collection tools at each site. Thematic and rapid analyses will help to identify key themes and categories through coding, guiding the design of quantitative data collection tools (enrollment survey, contact diaries, exit survey, and wearable proximity sensors) and the implementation of study procedures. We will create three age-specific contact matrices (physical, nonphysical, and both) at each study site using data from standardized contact diaries to characterize the patterns of social mixing. Regression analysis will be conducted to identify key drivers of contacts. We will comprehensively profile the frequency, duration, and intensity of infants' interactions with household members using high resolution data from the proximity sensors and calculating infants' proximity score (fraction of time spent by each household member in proximity with the infant, over the total infant contact time) for each household member.Our qualitative data yielded insights into the perceptions and acceptability of contact diaries and wearable proximity sensors for collecting social mixing data in LMICs. The quantitative data will allow a more accurate representation of human interactions that lead to the transmission of pathogens through close contact in LMICs. Our findings will provide more appropriate social mixing data for parameterizing mathematical models of LMIC populations. Our study tools could be adapted for other studies.Low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) bear a disproportionate burden of communicable diseases. Social interaction data inform infectious disease models and disease prevention strategies. The variations in demographics and contact patterns across ages, cultures, and locations significantly impact infectious disease dynamics and pathogen transmission. LMICs lack sufficient social interaction data for infectious disease modeling.","117":"The model captured key demographic and epidemiological features of TB among migrant and resident populations in Songjiang District, Shanghai. Between 2020 and 2035, we estimate that over 60% of TB cases will occur among migrants and that approximately 43% of these cases will result from recent infection. While TB incidence will decline under current policies, we estimate that additional interventions-including active screening and preventive treatment for migrants-could reduce TB incidence by an additional 20% by 2035.We developed a transmission dynamic model of TB for Songjiang District, Shanghai, which has experienced high migration over the past 25\u2009years. We calibrated the model to local demographic data, TB notifications, and molecular epidemiologic studies. We estimated epidemiological drivers as well as future outcomes of current TB policies and compared this base-case scenario with scenarios describing additional targeted interventions focusing on migrants or vulnerable residents.Large-scale rural-to-urban migration has changed the epidemiology of tuberculosis (TB) in large Chinese cities. We estimated the contribution of TB importation, reactivation of latent infection, and local transmission to new TB cases in Shanghai, and compared the potential impact of intervention options.Migrant-focused TB interventions could produce meaningful health benefits for migrants, as well as for young residents who receive indirect protection as a result of reduced TB transmission in Shanghai. Further studies to measure cost-effectiveness are needed to evaluate the feasibility of these interventions in Shanghai and similar urban centers experiencing high migration volumes.","118":"Modeling the long-term effect of therapies is challenging, especially given the limited follow-up duration of related trials. This generates recurrent debates on the presence of waning of treatment efficacy and heterogeneity across appraisals. More refined recommendations obtained by consensus among stakeholders could help to achieve greater consistency in decision making.Whether the effects of therapies may wane over time is a matter of debate, especially when considering their long-term cost-effectiveness. Here, we examined how the assumption of the waning of treatment effect was applied across the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) appraisals for disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) used in multiple sclerosis.We undertook a document analysis following a search of the NICE website. The inclusion criteria of the study were as follows: all publicly available documents related to completed appraisals for DMTs (period: January 2000 to July 2021). The exclusion criteria of the study were as follows: all documents that did not meet the inclusion criteria, especially pertaining to drugs used in other disease areas. We extracted information about the waning of treatment effect assumption as considered by companies, assessment groups, and appraisal committees, and we analyzed trends over time.We reviewed fifteen appraisals that reported guidance on sixteen DMTs. Irrespective of the drugs' mechanism of action or their pharmaceutical nature, there was substantial variation in the modalities when the assumption of waning was implemented. We noted the recent preference to use all-cause discontinuation as a proxy. This heterogeneity did not appear to affect acceptance of the DMTs (all but one were recommended for use across the National Health System (NHS)).","119":"A total of 281\u202f850 tweets from 90 unique social media accounts were collected. Each handle returned at least 1279 tweets, with 85 handles (94.4%) returning at least 3000 tweets. Tweet publication dates ranged from 2009 to 2020. A total of 274 tweets (0.097%) from 67 handles (74.4%) used a hashtag to support the BLM movement. Among the tweets labeled BLM, the first tweet was published in 2018 and only 4 tweets (1.5%) predated the killing of George Floyd. A similar trend of low signal observed was detected for the other categories (Black support: 244 tweets [0.086%] from 42 handles [46.7%] starting in 2013; Black health: 28 tweets [0.0099%] from 15 handles [16.7%] starting in 2018; social justice: 40 tweets [0.014%] from 21 handles [23.3%] starting in 2015).To explore how hospitals showed public-facing support for the Black community as measured through tweets about social equity or the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement.Using a retrospective longitudinal cohort study design, tweets from the top 100 ranked hospitals were collected, starting with the most recent over a 10-year span, from May 3, 2009, to June 26, 2020. The date of the George Floyd killing, May 25, 2020, was investigated as a point of interest. Data were analyzed from June 11 to December 4, 2020.These findings reflect the low signal of tweets regarding the Black community and social justice in a generalized way across approximately 10 years of tweets for all the hospital handles within the data set. From 2009 to 2020, hospitals rarely engaged in issues pertaining to the Black community and if so, only within the last half of this time period. These later entrances into these discussions indicate that these discussions are relatively recent.Tweets were manually identified based on 4 categories: BLM, associated with the BLM movement; Black support, expressed support for Black population within the hospital's community; Black health, pertained to health concerns specific to and the creation of health care for the Black community; or social justice, associated with general social justice terms that were too general to label as Black. If a tweet did not contain any hashtags from these categories, it remained unlabeled.Tensions around COVID-19 and systemic racism have raised the question: are hospitals advocating for equity for their Black patients? It is imperative for hospitals to be supportive of the Black community and acknowledge themselves as safe spaces, run by clinicians and staff who care about social justice issues that impact the health of the Black community; without the expression of support, Black patients may perceive hospitals as uncaring and unsafe, potentially delaying or avoiding treatment, which can result in serious complications and death for those with COVID-19.","120":"In epidemiology, realistic disease dynamics often require Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR)-like models because they account for incubation periods before individuals become infectious. However, for the sake of analytical tractability, simpler Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models are commonly used, despite their lack of biological realism. Bridging these models is crucial for accurately estimating parameters and fitting models to observed data, particularly in population-level studies of infectious diseases. This paper investigates stochastic versions of the SEIR and SIR frameworks and demonstrates that the SEIR model can be effectively approximated by a SIR model with time-dependent infection and recovery rates. The validity of this approximation is supported by the derivation of a large-population Functional Law of Large Numbers (FLLN) limit and a finite-population concentration inequality. To apply this approximation in practice, the paper introduces a parameter inference methodology based on the Dynamic Survival Analysis (DSA) survival analysis framework. This method enables the fitting of the SIR model to data simulated from the more complex SEIR dynamics, as illustrated through simulated experiments.","121":"We created a microsimulation model of pediatric intestinal failure over a 1-year time horizon. Model outcomes included cost (US dollars), blood transfusions received, and hemoglobin trend. Strategies tested included no supplementation, daily enteral supplementation, and monthly parenteral supplementation. We estimated parameters for the model using an institutional cohort of 55 patients. Model parameters updated each 1-month cycle using 2 regressions. A multivariate mixed-effects linear regression estimated hemoglobin values at the next month based on data from the prior month. A mixed-effects logistic regression on hemoglobin predicted the probability of receiving a blood transfusion in a given month.We found both parenteral and enteral iron to be effective at reducing blood transfusions. The cost of enteral iron makes it the desired choice in patients who can tolerate it. Future work should aim to identify which subpopulations of patients may benefit most from one strategy over the other.Children with chronic intestinal failure have a high prevalence of anemia, commonly from iron deficiency, leading to frequent blood transfusions. No current guideline exists for iron supplementation in these children. In this analysis, we evaluate the effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of using parenteral, enteral, and no iron supplementation to reduce blood transfusions.Compared with no supplementation, both enteral and parenteral iron supplementation reduced blood transfusions required per patient by 0.3 and 0.5 transfusions per year, respectively. Enteral iron cost $34 per avoided blood transfusion. Parenteral iron cost an additional $6600 per avoided blood transfusion compared with enteral iron.","122":"We have never known more about the genetic variation that characterizes life on earth, which is stored in ever-growing databases, many of which are publicly accessible. Yet, an accessible database does not mean that information is readily usable or interpretable.

Also home remedies and self-plans for ameliorating injection pain. (ii) Perceptual adaptation towards drugs aversion and fatigue, by their mind diversion practices, routinisation and normalisation of drug intake process. and constant reinforcement and re-interpretation of bodily signs of disease recovery (iii) Family caregivers intense and participatory care for PwDR-TB, by aiding their essential life activities and ensuring survival, learning and fulfilling special nutritional needs and goal oriented actions to aid drug intake (iv) Health care providers care, marked by swift and timely risk mitigation of side-effects and crisis response (v) Acquired self-efficacy of PwDR-TB, by their decisive family concerns resulting in attitudinal change. Also being sensitised on the detrimental consequences of disease and being motivated through positive examples.In this qualitative study using positive deviance framework, we conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews among consenting adult PwDR-TB (7 women, 13 men) who completed shorter treatment regimen (including injections) with maximum treatment adherence. The study was conducted in the southern districts of Bengaluru and Hyderabad, India between June 2020 and December 2022. Caregivers (14 women, 6 men) and health providers (8 men, 2 women) of PwDR-TB were also interviewed. Interviews were conducted in local language (Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu and Hindi) and inquired about practices, behaviours, experiences, perceptions and attributes which enabled maximum adherence and resilience of PwDR-TB. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and translated to English and coded for thematic analysis using inductive approach.United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT), Bengaluru, India.Synthesised findings on self-driven solutions and resilience towards the multi-dimensional DR-TB challenges provides opportunity for developing and testing new interventions for its effectiveness in DR-TB care settings globally. Designing and testing personalised cognitive interventions for PwDR-TB: to inculcate attitudinal change and self-efficacy towards medication, developing cognitive reinforcements to address the perception burden of treatment, skill building and mainstreaming the role of family caregivers as therapeutic partners of PwDR-TB, curating self-adaptive behaviours and practices of PwDR-TB to normalise their drug consumptions experiences could be the way forward in building resilience towards DR-TB.One-fifth of people with drug-resistance tuberculosis (DR-TB) who were initiated on newer shorter treatment regimen (with injection) had unfavourable treatment outcomes in India as on 2020. Evidence on self-driven solutions and resilience adapted by people with DR-TB (PwDR-TB) towards their multi-dimensional disease and treatment challenges are scarce globally, which we aimed to understand.","124":"In advanced age, decreased CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses to novel pathogens and cancer is paralleled by a decline in the number and function of na\u00efve CTL precursors (CTLp). Although the age-related fall in CD8(+) T-cell numbers is well established, neither the underlying mechanisms nor the extent of variation for different epitope specificities have been defined. Furthermore, na\u00efve CD8(+) T cells expressing high levels of CD44 accumulate with age, but it is unknown whether this accumulation reflects their preferential survival or an age-dependent driver of CD8(+) T-cell proliferation. Here, we track the number and phenotype of four influenza A virus (IAV)-specific CTLp populations in na\u00efve C57BL\/6 (B6) mice during aging, and compare T-cell receptor (TCR) clonal diversity for the CD44hi and CD44lo subsets of one such population. We show differential onset of decline for several IAV-specific CD8(+) T-cell populations with advanced age that parallel age-associated changes in the B6 immunodominance hierarchy, suggestive of distinct impacts of aging on different epitope-specific populations. Despite finding no evidence of clonal expansions in an aged, epitope-specific TCR repertoire, nonrandom alterations in TCR usage were observed, along with elevated CD5 and CD8 coreceptor expression. Collectively, these data demonstrate that na\u00efve CD8(+) T cells expressing markers of heightened self-recognition are selectively retained, but not clonally expanded, during aging. ","125":"While efficacious vaccines have been developed to inoculate against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; also known as COVID-19), public vaccine hesitancy could still undermine efforts to combat the pandemic. Employing a survey of 1096 adult Americans recruited via the Lucid platform, we examined the relationships between vaccine attributes, proposed policy interventions such as financial incentives, and misinformation on public vaccination preferences. Higher degrees of vaccine efficacy significantly increased individuals' willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, while a high incidence of minor side effects, a co-pay, and Emergency Use Authorization to fast-track the vaccine decreased willingness. The vaccine manufacturer had no influence on public willingness to vaccinate. We also found no evidence that belief in misinformation about COVID-19 treatments was positively associated with vaccine hesitancy. The findings have implications for public health strategies intending to increase levels of community vaccination.","126":"Structural studies of the 3'-end of the oncogenic long non-coding RNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) confirmed a unique triple-helix structure. This structure enables accumulation of the transcript, and high levels of MALAT1 are found in several cancers. Here, we synthesize a small molecule library based on an RNA-binding scaffold, diphenylfuran (DPF), screen it against a variety of nucleic acid constructs, and demonstrate for the first time that the MALAT1 triple helix can be selectively targeted with small molecules. Computational analysis revealed a trend between subunit positioning and composition on DPF shape and intramolecular interactions, which in turn generally correlated with selectivity and binding strengths. This work thus provides design strategies toward chemical probe development for the MALAT1 triple helix and suggests that comprehensive analyses of RNA-focused libraries can generate insights into selective RNA recognition.","127":"Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are high-priority bacterial pathogens targeted for efforts to decrease transmissions and infections in healthcare facilities. Some regions have experienced CRE outbreaks that were likely amplified by frequent transmission in long-term acute care hospitals (LTACHs). Planning and funding of intervention efforts focused on LTACHs is one proposed strategy to contain outbreaks; however, the potential regional benefits of such efforts are unclear.We designed an agent-based simulation model of patients in a regional network of 10 healthcare facilities including 1 LTACH, 3 short-stay acute care hospitals (ACHs), and 6 nursing homes (NHs). The model was calibrated to achieve realistic patient flow and CRE transmission and detection rates. We then simulated the initiation of an entirely LTACH-focused intervention in a previously CRE-free region, including active surveillance for CRE carriers and enhanced isolation of identified carriers.When initiating the intervention at the first clinical CRE detection in the LTACH, cumulative CRE transmissions over 5 years across all 10 facilities were reduced by 79%-93% compared to no-intervention simulations. This result was robust to changing assumptions for transmission within non-LTACH facilities and flow of patients from the LTACH. Delaying the intervention until the 20th CRE detection resulted in substantial delays in achieving optimal regional prevalence, while still reducing transmissions by 60%-79% over 5 years.Focusing intervention efforts on LTACHs is potentially a highly efficient strategy for reducing CRE transmissions across an entire region, particularly when implemented as early as possible in an emerging outbreak.","128":"Fifty-one CAA cases were identified through a provincial physician reporting system between 2008 and 2011. We examined eight of these cases and 26 matched controls. Genotyping revealed a significant association between HLA-B27 and CAA (odds ratio [OR] 9.2, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.54-54.6). We also observed a similar association with the HLA-B27 tag single nucleotide polymorphism rs4349859 (OR 9.2, 95% CI 1.5-54.6) and rs13202464 (OR 6.7, 95% CI 1.1-41).

Health care providers should inform people who are identified as having CAA that it is genetically determined and can recur with continued cocaine use. The severity of infections and subsequent hospitalization, and the risk of recurrence may prompt health-promoting behaviour changes of the affected individuals. These genetic associations warrant the attention of public health and knowledge translation efforts to highlight the implications for susceptibility to this severe adverse drug event.We performed a case-control study using a genotyping assay and novel gene chip to test the association between cocaine-associated agranulocytosis (CAA) and HLA-B27 and to identify pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic gene variants associated with the phenotype.Drug-induced agranulocytosis is a recognized adverse drug event associated with serious infectious complications. Levamisole is an antihelminthic and immunomodulator withdrawn from North American markets in 2005 after reports of agranulocytosis. Previous studies of levamisole, suggest that the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 confers a genetic predisposition to this adverse drug event.

If these hypotheses prove true, we will take steps to disseminate the program to rural preschools across China.Interactive and experiential learning programs have proven effective to teach children safety and prevent child unintentional injury. However, previously-published programs were designed primarily to address safety concerns of children living in urban, well-resourced areas, and therefore might be less effective or economically infeasible to distribute to children in resource-limited areas, such as those living in rural areas or underdeveloped regions. This proposed study will evaluate the effectiveness of teaching children safety lessons to rural preschoolers in China through the preschool-based Safety Experience Room intervention that was developed based on relevant theories, the lessons of previous intervention research, the characteristics of child injuries in underdeveloped rural areas, and the needs and circumstances of rural families and preschools in China. The study will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of delivering the program.A single-blinded, 12-month follow-up, parallel-group cluster randomized controlled trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio will be implemented in two selected counties. In total, at least 2378 rural preschoolers aged 3-6 years old will be recruited from 12 preschools, 6 in Yang County and 6 in Shicheng County. Clusters will be randomized at the preschool level and allocated to the control group (routine school-based education) or the intervention group (routine school-based education plus the Safety Experience Room education). External support strategies will be implemented by local partners to minimize attrition. Data collection will be conducted at baseline and then every 3 months during a 12-month follow-up time period. Intention-to-treat (ITT) data analysis will be used. Generalized estimation equations (GEE) will evaluate the effectiveness of the program and generalized cost-effectiveness analysis (GCEA) will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of it. A per-protocol (PP) sensitivity analysis will assess the robustness of ITT results.

We infer that a uniform compliance of social distancing and vaccination uptake among different demographic subpopulations underestimates the severity of the epidemic in comparison to differentiated compliance among different demographic subpopulations. This result holds for both urban and rural regions.Self-protective behaviors of social distancing and vaccination uptake vary by demographics and affect the transmission dynamics of influenza in the United States. By incorporating the socio-behavioral differences in social distancing and vaccination uptake into mathematical models of influenza transmission dynamics, we can improve our estimates of epidemic outcomes. In this study we analyze the impact of demographic disparities in social distancing and vaccination on influenza epidemics in urban and rural regions of the United States.By taking into account the behavioral differences in social distancing and vaccination uptake among different demographic subpopulations in analysis of influenza epidemics, we provide improved estimates of epidemic outcomes that can assist in improved public health interventions for prevention and control of influenza.We conducted a survey of a nationally representative sample of US adults to collect data on their self-protective behaviors, including social distancing and vaccination to protect themselves from influenza infection. We incorporated this data in an agent-based model to simulate the transmission dynamics of influenza in the urban region of Miami Dade county in Florida and the rural region of Montgomery county in Virginia.","132":"Markov models are commonly used for decision-making studies in many application domains; however, there are no widely adopted methods for performing sensitivity analysis on such models with uncertain transition probability matrices (TPMs). This article describes two simulation-based approaches for conducting probabilistic sensitivity analysis on a given discrete-time, finite-horizon, finite-state Markov model using TPMs that are sampled over a specified uncertainty set according to a relevant probability distribution. The first approach assumes no prior knowledge of the probability distribution, and each row of a TPM is independently sampled from the uniform distribution on the row's uncertainty set. The second approach involves random sampling from the (truncated) multivariate normal distribution of the TPM's maximum likelihood estimators for its rows subject to the condition that each row has nonnegative elements and sums to one. The two sampling methods are easily implemented and have reasonable computation times. A case study illustrates the application of these methods to a medical decision-making problem involving the evaluation of treatment guidelines for glycemic control of patients with type 2 diabetes, where natural variation in a patient's glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is modeled as a Markov chain, and the associated TPMs are subject to uncertainty.","133":"Based on studies published up to July 2021, most SARS-CoV-2 infections were not persistently asymptomatic, and asymptomatic infections were less infectious than symptomatic infections. Summary estimates from meta-analysis may be misleading when variability between studies is extreme and prediction intervals should be presented. Future studies should determine the asymptomatic proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections caused by variants of concern and in people with immunity following vaccination or previous infection. Without prospective longitudinal studies with methods that minimise selection and measurement biases, further updates with the study types included in this living systematic review are unlikely to be able to provide a reliable summary estimate of the proportion of asymptomatic infections caused by SARS-CoV-2.Open Science Framework (https:\/\/osf.io\/9ewys\/).The protocol was first published on 1 April 2020 and last updated on 18 June 2021. We searched PubMed, Embase, bioRxiv, and medRxiv, aggregated in a database of SARS-CoV-2 literature, most recently on 6 July 2021. Studies of people with PCR-diagnosed SARS-CoV-2, which documented symptom status at the beginning and end of follow-up, or mathematical modelling studies were included. Studies restricted to people already diagnosed, of single individuals or families, or without sufficient follow-up were excluded. One reviewer extracted data and a second verified the extraction, with disagreement resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Risk of bias in empirical studies was assessed with a bespoke checklist and modelling studies with a published checklist. All data syntheses were done using random effects models. Review question (1): We included 130 studies. Heterogeneity was high so we did not estimate a mean proportion of asymptomatic infections overall (interquartile range (IQR) 14% to 50%, prediction interval 2% to 90%), or in 84 studies based on screening of defined populations (IQR 20% to 65%, prediction interval 4% to 94%). In 46 studies based on contact or outbreak investigations, the summary proportion asymptomatic was 19% (95% confidence interval (CI) 15% to 25%, prediction interval 2% to 70%). (2) The secondary attack rate in contacts of people with asymptomatic infection compared with symptomatic infection was 0.32 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.64, prediction interval 0.11 to 0.95, 8 studies). (3) In 13 modelling studies fit to data, the proportion of all SARS-CoV-2 transmission from presymptomatic individuals was higher than from asymptomatic individuals. Limitations of the evidence include high heterogeneity and high risks of selection and information bias in studies that were not designed to measure persistently asymptomatic infection, and limited information about variants of concern or in people who have been vaccinated.Debate about the level of asymptomatic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection continues. The amount of evidence is increasing and study designs have changed over time. We updated a living systematic review to address 3 questions: (1) Among people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2, what proportion does not experience symptoms at all during their infection? (2) What is the infectiousness of asymptomatic and presymptomatic, compared with symptomatic, SARS-CoV-2 infection? (3) What proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a population is accounted for by people who are asymptomatic or presymptomatic?","134":"Viruses that infect microbial hosts have traditionally been studied in laboratory settings with a focus on either obligate lysis or persistent lysogeny. In the environment, these infection archetypes are part of a continuum that spans antagonistic to beneficial modes. In this Review, we advance a framework to accommodate the context-dependent nature of virus-microorganism interactions in ecological communities by synthesizing knowledge from decades of virology research, eco-evolutionary theory and recent technological advances. We discuss that nuanced outcomes, rather than the extremes of the continuum, are particularly likely in natural communities given variability in abiotic factors, the availability of suboptimal hosts and the relevance of multitrophic partnerships. We revisit the 'rules of life' in terms of how long-term infections shape the fate of viruses and microbial cells, populations and ecosystems.","135":"We studied skin microbial communities of humans and cattle (zebu) in rural Madagascar to investigate how zebu ownership affects microbial composition of the human skin, and to characterize non-Western human and zebu skin communities more generally. A portion of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced from samples of zebu backs and human ankles, forearms, hands and armpits. Analyses were conducted in QIIME, R and LEfSe.Human and zebu samples varied in microbial community composition, yet we did not find evidence for a shared microbial signature between an individual and his zebu. Microbial communities differed across human body sites, with ankles reflecting increased diversity and greater similarity to samples from zebu, likely due to extensive shared contact with soil by humans and zebu.Cattle ownership had, at best, weak effects on the human skin microbiome. We suggest that components of human biology and lifestyles override the microbial signature of close contact with zebu, including genetic factors and human-human interaction, irrespective of zebu ownership. Understanding ecological drivers of microbial communities will help determine ways that microbial transfer and community composition change as populations adopt Western lifestyles, and could provide insights into zoonotic disease transmission.The skin harbors a dynamic community of microorganisms, where contact with humans, other animals and the environment can alter microbial communities. Most research on the human skin microbiome features Western populations living in hygienic conditions, yet these populations have vastly different patterns of environmental contact than the majority of people on Earth, including those living in developing countries.","136":"Malaria is an endemic disease in India and targeted to eliminate by the year 2030. The present study is aimed at understanding the epidemiological patterns of\u00a0malaria transmission dynamics in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh followed by the development of a malaria prediction model using monthly climate factors. A total of 144,055 cases in Assam during 2011-2018 and 42,970 cases in Arunachal Pradesh were reported during the 2011-2019 period observed, and Plasmodium falciparum (74.5%) was the most predominant parasite in Assam, whereas Plasmodium vivax (66%) in Arunachal Pradesh. Malaria transmission showed a strong seasonal variation where most of the cases were reported during the monsoon period (Assam, 51.9%, and Arunachal Pradesh, 53.6%). Similarly, the malaria incidence was highest in the male population in both states (Asam, 55.75%, and Arunachal Pradesh, 51.43%), and the disease risk is also higher among the\u2009>\u200915\u00a0years age group (Assam, 61.7%, and Arunachal Pradesh, 67.9%). To predict the malaria incidence, Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) and Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors (SARIMAX) models were implemented. A statistically significant association between malaria cases and climate variables was observed. The most influencing climate factors are found to be maximum and mean temperature with a 6-month lag, and it showed a negative association with malaria incidence. The BSTS model has shown superior performance on the optimal auto-correlated dataset (OAD) which contains auto-correlated malaria cases, cross-correlated climate variables besides malaria cases in both Assam (RMSE, 0.106; MAE, 0.089; and SMAPE, 19.2%) and Arunachal Pradesh (RMSE, 0.128; MAE, 0.122; and SMAPE, 22.6%) than the SARIMAX model. The findings suggest that the predictive performance of the BSTS model is outperformed, and it may be helpful for ongoing intervention strategies by governmental and nongovernmental agencies in the northeast region to combat the disease effectively.","137":"Patients with severe malaria (n = 119), uncomplicated malaria (n = 91), or suspected bacterial sepsis (n = 56), as well as healthy participants (n = 50), were recruited. The systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) was estimated from the echocardiographic cardiac index and the mean arterial pressure.CFH is associated with mean arterial pressure, SVRI, and peripheral perfusion in patients with severe malaria. This may be mediated through the nitric oxide scavenging potency of CFH, increasing basal vascular tone and impairing tissue perfusion.In severe falciparum malaria, unlike sepsis, hypotension on admission is uncommon. We hypothesized that low nitric oxide bioavailability due to the presence of cell-free hemoglobin (CFH) increases vascular tone in severe malaria.SVRI and hematocrit levels were lower and plasma CFH and asymmetric dimethylarginine levels were higher in patients with malaria, compared with healthy participants. In multivariate linear regression models for mean arterial pressure or SVRI in patients with severe malaria, hematocrit and CFH but not asymmetric dimethylarginine were significant predictors. The SVRI was lower in patients with suspected bacterial sepsis than in those with severe malaria, after adjustment for hematocrit and age. Plasma CFH levels correlated positively with the core-peripheral temperature gradient and plasma lactate levels and inversely with the perfusion index. Impaired peripheral perfusion, as reflected by a low perfusion index or a high core-peripheral temperature gradient, predicted mortality in patients with severe malaria.","138":"This article presents a novel scalable character-based phylogeny algorithm for dense viral sequencing data called SPHERE (Scalable PHylogEny with REcurrent mutations). The algorithm is based on an evolutionary model where recurrent mutations are allowed, but backward mutations are prohibited. The algorithm creates rooted character-based phylogeny trees, wherein all leaves and internal nodes are labeled by observed taxa. We show that SPHERE phylogeny is more stable than Nextstrain's, and that it accurately infers known transmission links from the early pandemic. SPHERE is a fast algorithm that can process >200,000 sequences in <2 hours, which offers a compact phylogenetic visualization of Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID).","139":"A novel coronavirus emerged in December of 2019 (COVID-19), causing a pandemic that inflicted unprecedented public health and economic burden in all nooks and corners of the world. Although the control of COVID-19 largely focused on the use of basic public health measures (primarily based on using non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as quarantine, isolation, social-distancing, face mask usage, and community lockdowns) initially, three safe and highly-effective vaccines (by AstraZeneca Inc., Moderna Inc., and Pfizer Inc.), were approved for use in humans in December 2020. We present a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of these vaccines on curtailing the burden of COVID-19. The model stratifies the total population into two subgroups, based on whether or not they habitually wear face mask in public. The resulting multigroup model, which takes the form of a deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations, is fitted and parameterized using COVID-19 cumulative mortality data for the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Conditions for the asymptotic stability of the associated disease-free equilibrium, as well as an expression for the vaccine-derived herd immunity threshold, are rigorously derived. Numerical simulations of the model show that the size of the initial proportion of individuals in the mask-wearing group, together with positive change in behavior from the non-mask wearing group (as well as those in the mask-wearing group, who do not abandon their mask-wearing habit) play a crucial role in effectively curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. This study further shows that the prospect of achieving vaccine-derived herd immunity (required for COVID-19 elimination) in the U.S., using the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, is quite promising. In particular, our study shows that herd immunity can be achieved in the U.S. if at least 60% of the population are fully vaccinated. Furthermore, the prospect of eliminating the pandemic in the U.S. in the year 2021 is significantly enhanced if the vaccination program is complemented with non-pharmaceutical interventions at moderate increased levels of compliance (in relation to their baseline compliance). The study further suggests that, while the waning of natural and vaccine-derived immunity against COVID-19 induces only a marginal increase in the burden and projected time-to-elimination of the pandemic, adding the impacts of therapeutic benefits of the vaccines into the model resulted in a dramatic reduction in the burden and time-to-elimination of the pandemic.","140":"Human infection with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is driven by recurring dromedary-to-human spill-over events, leading decision-makers to consider dromedary vaccination. Dromedary vaccine candidates in the development pipeline are showing hopeful results, but gaps in our understanding of the epidemiology of MERS-CoV in dromedaries must be addressed to design and evaluate potential vaccination strategies. We aim to bring together existing measures of MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels to assess the distribution of infection, highlighting knowledge gaps and implications for animal vaccination. We systematically reviewed the published literature on MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science that reported seroprevalence and\/or prevalence of active MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels from both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. 60 studies met our eligibility criteria. Qualitative syntheses determined that MERS-CoV seroprevalence increased with age up to 80-100% in adult dromedaries supporting geographically widespread endemicity of MERS-CoV in dromedaries in both the Arabian Peninsula and countries exporting dromedaries from Africa. The high prevalence of active infection measured in juveniles and at sites where dromedary populations mix should guide further investigation - particularly of dromedary movement - and inform vaccination strategy design and evaluation through mathematical modelling.","141":"Using a One Health approach, we show that AMU can potentially be estimated from cross-sectional surveys, although results are hypothetical due to small sample size and are sensitive to the chosen population denominator.

We defined a code list to classify low-acuity calls and merged the dataset with sociodemographic indicators and data on population density.The number of emergency calls (phone number 112 in Germany) increased by 9.1% from 2018 to 2021; however, the proportion of low-acuity calls did not increase. The regression model shows higher odds of low-acuity for young to medium age groups (especially for age 0-9, OR 1.50 [95% CI 1.45-1.55]; age 10-19, OR 1.77 [95% CI 1.71-1.83]; age 20-29, OR 1.64 [95% CI 1.59-1.68] and age 30-39, OR 1.40 [95% CI 1.37-1.44]; p\u2009<\u20090.001, reference group 80-89) and for females (OR 1.12 [95% CI 1.1-1.13], p\u2009<\u20090.001). Odds were slightly higher for calls from a neighbourhood with lower social status (OR 1.01 per index unit increase [95% CI 1.0-1.01], p\u2009<\u20090.05) and at the weekend (OR 1.02 [95% CI 1.0-1.04, p\u2009<\u20090.05]). No significant association of the call volume with population density was detected.The Emergency Medical Service (EMS) in Germany is increasingly challenged by strongly rising demand. Speculations about a greater utilisation for minor cases have led to intensive media coverage, but empirical evidence is lacking. We investigated the development of low-acuity calls from 2018 to 2021 in the federal state of Berlin and its correlations with sociodemographic characteristics.This analysis provides valuable new insights into pre-hospital emergency care. Low-acuity calls were not the primary driver of increased EMS utilisation in Berlin. Younger age is the strongest predictor for low-acuity calls in the model. The association with female gender is significant, while socially deprived neighbourhoods play a minor role. No statistically significant differences in call volume between densely and less densely populated regions were detected. The results can inform the EMS in future resource planning.","143":"For infectious disease prevention, policy-makers are typically required to base policy decisions in light of operational and monetary restrictions, prohibiting implementation of all candidate interventions. To inform the evidence-base underpinning policy decision making, mathematical and health economic modelling can be a valuable constituent. Applied to England, this study aims to identify the optimal target age groups when extending a seasonal influenza vaccination programme of at-risk individuals to those individuals at low risk of developing complications following infection. To perform this analysis, we utilise an age- and strain-structured transmission model that includes immunity propagation mechanisms which link prior season epidemiological outcomes to immunity at the beginning of the following season. Making use of surveillance data from the past decade in conjunction with our dynamic model, we simulate transmission dynamics of seasonal influenza in England from 2012 to 2018. We infer that modified susceptibility due to natural infection in the previous influenza season is the only immunity propagation mechanism to deliver a non-negligible impact on the transmission dynamics. Further, we discerned case ascertainment to be higher for young infants compared to adults under 65 years old, and uncovered a decrease in case ascertainment as age increased from 65 to 85 years of age. Our health economic appraisal sweeps vaccination age space to determine threshold vaccine dose prices achieving cost-effectiveness under differing paired strategies. In particular, we model offering vaccination to all those low-risk individuals younger than a given age (but no younger than two years old) and all low-risk individuals older than a given age, while maintaining vaccination of at-risk individuals of any age. All posited strategies were deemed cost-effective. In general, the addition of low-risk vaccination programmes whose coverage encompassed children and young adults (aged 20 and below) were highly cost-effective. The inclusion of elder age-groups to the low-risk programme typically lessened the cost-effectiveness. Notably, elderly-centric programmes vaccinating from 65-75 years and above had the least permitted expense per vaccine.","144":" copy number variation arises from ecological divergence not only between organisms exploiting marine and freshwater habitats but also between freshwater organisms exploiting divergent resources.","145":"There is clear need for more effective public health policies. Coupled with calls for more effective policies, increasing demand to address public health disparities experienced by systemically marginalized and historically oppressed groups emphasizes the long-standing need for policies that improve public health equity. Such need is highlighted when examining public health issues such as alcohol- and substance-exposed pregnancy (ASEP): Current policies are ineffective at reducing ASEP, and marginalized groups experience disproportionately lower benefits and higher negative consequences as a result of such policies. Powerful strategies to develop more effective policies that can account for the complexity of such issues, such as systems science methods (SSMs), are becoming popular. However, current best practices for such methods often do not emphasize the additional efforts that will be required to develop equitable, not just effective policies. Using ASEP as an example of a crucial complex issue requiring new policy, we suggest additional steps to include in SSM projects for developing more effective policies that will also help stakeholders determine high-equity policies to reduce health disparities. These steps include modeling structural differences experienced by marginalized groups via systemic racism and oppression, incorporating existing cultural and community sources of strength and resilience as key areas for policy development, and evaluating the sustainability of policies as a dimension of efficacy. We also discuss using community-based participatory approaches as a framework for all SSM processes to ensure that policy development itself is grounded in equitable shared decision-making for marginalized individuals.","146":"The incidence of EC in this population was 28.8 per 100,000 person-years. Regardless of menopausal status, obesity (BMI\u226527) was associated with increased EC risk (HR=2.22, 95%CI 1.26-3.92), while later age at menarche was associated with decreased EC risk (HR=0.14, 95%CI 0.04-0.46). In postmenopausal women, later age at menopause was associated with increased EC risk (HR= 2.82, 95%CI 1.24-6.43). Lifestyle and nutritional factors were not associated with risk of EC in this cohort.The incidence of Endometrial cancer (EC) has grown substantially in Asia over the past decade. However, few studies have addressed risk factors associated with EC incidence in Asian populations. We explored the association between reproductive and dietary risk factors and EC in the Singapore Chinese Health Study (SCHS), one of the largest prospective cohort studies in Asia.This study is one of the largest cohort studies exploring EC risk factors in Asian populations. Our study identified similarities in EC risk factors for European and Asian populations, which potentially suggests that strategies developed for EC prevention in Western populations can be potentially appropriate for the Singapore Chinese population due to risk factor similarities.Data were collected from 34,028 ethnically Chinese women aged 45-74 residing in Singapore, enrolled between 1993 and 1998. Baseline demographic, dietary, and reproductive factors were collected via structured questionnaires. EC cases were identified from the Singapore Cancer Registry (n=126) up to 2010. Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze association between EC and personal, reproductive, and dietary factors.","147":"Behavioral avoidance of parasites is a widespread strategy among animal hosts and in human public health. Avoidance has repercussions for both individual and population-level infection risk. Although most cases of parasite avoidance are viewed as adaptive, there is little evidence that the basic assumptions of evolution by natural selection are met. This study addresses this gap by testing whether there is heritable variation in parasite avoidance behavior. We quantified behavioral avoidance of the bacterial parasite Serratia marcescens for 12 strains of the nematode host Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that these strains varied in their magnitude of avoidance, and we estimated broad-sense heritability of this behavior to be in the range of 11%-26%. We then asked whether avoidance carries a constitutive fitness cost. We did not find evidence of one. Rather, strains with higher avoidance had higher fitness, measured as population growth rate. Together, these results direct future theoretical and empirical work to identify the forces maintaining genetic variation in parasite avoidance.","148":"Probability distributions of the times and probabilities were computed for the population and for groups based on age and sex. Our results show that for the times that characterize the course of the disease for a given patient (to hospitalization, to ICU or death), the variation from an age group to another is very small (around of 10% of fixed effect intercept) and the effect of sex is even weaker (around 1%). The course of the disease appears to be very similar for all patients. The probability that a patient advances from one stage of the disease to another (to hospitalization, to ICU, to death), on the other hand, is heavily influenced by sex and age. Relative risk of death for males (based on 22924 dead) is 1.7.Data from Colombian official case information were collated for a period of five months. Dynamical parameters of the disease spread were then estimated from the data. Probability distribution models were identified that represent the time from symptom onset to hospitalization, to ICU admission and to death. Kaplan Meier estimates were also computed for the probability of eventually requiring hospitalization, needing ICU attention and of dying from the disease (the CFR).To characterize the dynamics of the epidemic, for modeling purposes.The times from one stage of the disease to another are almost independent of the major patient's variables (sex, age). This is in stark contrast to the probabilities of going from one stage to another which show a strong dependence on age and sex. Data also show that the length of hospital and ICU stays are almost independent of sex and age. The only factor that affects this length was the eventual outcome (survival or death) of the disease. The time is significantly longer for surviving patients.","149":"Background\r\nMalaria claims hundreds of thousands of lives each year, most of them children. A \u0093malaria-free world\u0094 is the World Health Organization\u0092s vision, but elimination from the southeast Asian Region is hampered by factors including anti-malarial resistance and systematic underreporting. Malaria is a significant public health problem in Bangladesh and while there have been recent gains in control, there is large spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the disease burden. This study aims to determine the pattern and stability of malaria hotspots in Bangladesh with the end goal of informing intervention planning for elimination.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nMalaria in Bangladesh exhibited highly seasonal, hypoendemic transmission in geographic hotspots, which remained conserved over time. The southeast areas of the Chittagong Hill Tracts were identified as malaria hotspots for all 4 years examined. Similarly, areas in Sunamganj and Netrakona districts in the Northeast were hotspots for 2013\u00962016. Highly stable hotspots from 1 year predicted the following year\u0092s hotspot locations in the southeast of Bangladesh. Hotspots did not appear to act as sources of spread with no evidence of consistent patterns of contiguous spread or recession of hotspots as high or low transmission seasons progressed.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nAreas were identified with temporal and spatial clustering of high malaria incidence in Bangladesh. Further studies are required to understand the vector, sociodemographic and disease dynamics within these hotspots. Given the low caseloads occurring in the low transmission seasons, and the conserved nature of malaria hotspots, directing resources towards these areas may be an efficient way to achieve malaria elimination in Bangladesh.","150":"Socio-economic factors could impact how epidemics spread. In this study, we investigated the possible effect of several local socio-economic factors on the case count and time course of confirmed Covid-19 cases and Covid-19-related deaths across the twenty one counties of New Jersey. Socio-economic and geographic factors considered included population, percentage of elders in the population, percentage of low-income households, access to food and health facilities and distance to New York. We found that the counties could be clustered into three groups based on (a) the case totals, (b) the total number of deaths, (c) the time course of the cases and (d) the time course of the deaths. The four groupings were very similar to one another and could all be largely explained by the county population, the percentage of low-income population, and the distance of the county from New York. As for food and health factors, the numbers of local restaurants and pharmacies significantly influenced the total number of cases and deaths as well as the epidemic's evolution. In particular, the number of cases and deaths showed a decrease with the number of McDonald's within the county in contrast to other fast-food or non-fast food restaurants. Overall, our study found that the evolution of the epidemic was influenced by certain socio-economic factors, which could be helpful for the formulation of public health policies.","151":"In 2013, U.S. swine producers were confronted with the disruptive emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED). Movement of animals among farms is hypothesised to have played a role in the spread of PED among farms. Via this or other mechanisms, the rate of spread may also depend on the geographic density of farms and climate. To evaluate such effects on a large scale, we analyse state-level counts of outbreaks with variables describing the distribution of farm sizes and types, aggregate flows of animals among farms, and an index of climate. Our first main finding is that it is possible for a correlation analysis to be sensitive to transmission model parameters. This finding is based on a global sensitivity analysis of correlations on simulated data that included a biased and noisy observation model based on the available PED data. Our second main finding is that flows are significantly associated with the reports of PED outbreaks. This finding is based on correlations of pairwise relationships and regression modeling of total and weekly outbreak counts. These findings illustrate how variation in population structure may be employed along with observational data to improve understanding of disease spread. ","152":"Multiple waves of transmission during infectious disease epidemics represent a major public health challenge, but the ecological and behavioral drivers of epidemic resurgence are poorly understood. In theory, community structure\u2014aggregation into highly intraconnected and loosely interconnected social groups\u2014within human populations may lead to punctuated outbreaks as diseases progress from one community to the next. However, this explanation has been largely overlooked in favor of temporal shifts in environmental conditions and human behavior and because of the difficulties associated with estimating large-scale contact patterns.We used an extensive dataset of proximal physical contacts between users of a public Wi-Fi Internet system to evaluate the epidemiological implications of an empirical urban contact network. We characterized the modularity (community structure) of the network and then estimated epidemic dynamics under a percolation-based model of infectious disease spread on the network. We classified simulated epidemics as multiwave using a novel metric and we identified network structures that were critical to the network's ability to produce multiwave epidemics.We identified robust community structure in a large, empirical urban contact network from which multiwave epidemics may emerge naturally. This pattern was fueled by a special kind of insularity in which locally popular individuals were not the ones forging contacts with more distant social groups.The aim was to characterize naturally arising patterns of human contact that are capable of producing simulated epidemics with multiple wave structures.Our results suggest that ordinary contact patterns can produce multiwave epidemics at the scale of a single urban area without the temporal shifts that are usually assumed to be responsible. Understanding the role of community structure in epidemic dynamics allows officials to anticipate epidemic resurgence without having to forecast future changes in hosts, pathogens, or the environment.","153":"Residential biomass burning is an important source of black carbon (BC) exposure among rural communities in low- and middle-income countries. We collected 7165 personal BC samples and individual\/household level information from 3103 pregnant women enrolled in the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network trial. Women in the intervention arm received free liquefied petroleum gas stoves and fuel throughout pregnancy; women in the control arm continued the use of biomass stoves. Median (IQR) postintervention BC exposures were 9.6 \u03bcg\/m3 (5.2-14.0) for controls and 2.8 \u03bcg\/m3 (1.6-4.8) for the intervention group. Using mixed models, we characterized predictors of BC exposure and assessed how exposure contrasts differed between arms by select predictors. Primary stove type was the strongest predictor (R2 = 0.42); the models including kerosene use, kitchen location, education, occupation, or stove use hours also provided additional explanatory power from the base model adjusted only for the study site. Our full, trial-wide, model explained 48% of the variation in BC exposures. We found evidence that the BC exposure contrast between arms differed by study site, adherence to the assigned study stove, and whether the participant cooked. Our findings highlight factors that may be addressed before and during studies to implement more impactful cookstove intervention trials.","154":"Polio can circulate unobserved in regions that are challenging to monitor. To assess the probability of silent circulation, simulation models can be used to understand transmission dynamics when detection is unreliable. Model assumptions, however, impact the estimated probability of silent circulation. Here, we examine the impact of having distinct populations, rather than a single well-mixed population, with a discrete-individual model including environmental surveillance. We show that partitioning a well-mixed population into networks of distinct communities may result in a higher probability of silent circulation as a result of the time it takes for the detection of a circulation event. Population structure should be considered when assessing polio control in a region with many loosely interacting communities.","155":"Fentanyl and its analogs contribute substantially to drug overdose deaths in the United States. There is concern that people using drugs are being unknowingly exposed to fentanyl, increasing their risk of overdose death. This study examines temporal trends and spatial variations in the co-occurrence of fentanyl with other seized drugs.We analyzed data from 11,940,207 samples. Fentanyl co-occurrence with all examined substances increased monotonically over time (Mann-Kendall p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Nationally, fentanyl co-occurrence was highest among heroin samples (approx. 50%), but relatively low among methamphetamine (\u22641%), cocaine (\u22644%), and other drug samples. However, co-occurrence rates have grown to over 10% for cocaine and methamphetamine in several Northeast states in 2017-2023.Fentanyl co-occurs most commonly with heroin, but its presence in stimulant supplies is increasing in some areas, where it may pose a disproportionately high risk of overdose.This work was partly supported by FDA grant U01FD00745501. This article reflects the views of the authors and does not represent the views or policies of the FDA or US Department of Health and Human Services.We identified fentanyl co-occurrence (the proportion of samples of non-fentanyl substances that also contain fentanyl) among 9 substances or substance classes of interest: methamphetamine, cannabis, cocaine, heroin, club drugs, hallucinogens, and prescription opioids, stimulants, and benzodiazepines. We used serial cross-sectional data on drug reports across 50 states and the District of Columbia from the National Forensic Laboratory Information System, the largest available database on the U.S. illicit drug supply, from January 2013 to December\u00a02023.","156":". Cost-effective analysis was applied to investigate the most cost-effective strategy from various combination of control strategies. The results show that strategy combining all the control variables is the most cost-effective strategy followed by the strategy involving both personal-protection, the vaccination-only strategy was the least cost-effective. Although vaccination strategy is not cost-effective in this study, it is as effective in curtailing the infection as the other two control strategies. The study suggests that governments of communities with limited resources should consider complementing the use of vaccine with the use of facial mask particularly in hard-to-reach places in their communities.","157":"Over 30 days in the simulated elementary school, the probability of at least one in-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the number of estimated additional infections in the immediate school community associated with changes in mitigation measures varied widely. In one scenario with the delta variant and no student vaccination, assuming that baseline mitigation measures of simple ventilation and handwashing reduce the secondary attack rate by 40%, if decision-makers seek to keep the monthly probability of an in-school transmission below 50%, additional mitigation (e.g., masking) would need to be added at a community incidence of approximately 2\/100,000\/day. Once students are vaccinated, thresholds shift substantially higher.The interpretation of model results should be limited by the uncertainty in many of the parameters, including the effectiveness of individual mitigation interventions and vaccine efficacy against the delta variant, and the limited scope of the model beyond the school community. Additionally, the assumed case detection rate (33% of cases detected) may be too high in areas with decreased testing capacity.We used a previously published agent-based dynamic transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 in K-12 schools to simulate an elementary school with 638 students across 12 scenarios: combinations of three viral infectiousness levels (reflecting wild-type virus, alpha variant, and delta variant) and four student vaccination levels (0%, 25%, 50% and 70% coverage). For each scenario, we varied observed community COVID-19 incidence (0 to 50 cases\/100,000 people\/day) and mitigation effectiveness (0-100% reduction to in-school secondary attack rate), and evaluated two outcomes over a 30 day period: (1) the probability of at least one in-school transmission, and (2) average increase in total infections among students, educators\/staff, and their household members associated with moving from more to less intensive mitigation measures.Despite the assumption of high adult vaccination, the risks of both in-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission and resulting infections among students, educators\/staff, and their household members remain high when the delta variant predominates and students are unvaccinated. Mitigation measures or vaccinations for students can substantially reduce these risks. These findings underscore the potential role for responsive plans, where mitigation is deployed based on local COVID-19 incidence and vaccine uptake.While CDC guidance for K-12 schools recommends indoor masking regardless of vaccination status, final decisions about masking in schools will be made at the local and state level. The impact of the removal of mask restrictions, however, on COVID-19 outcomes for elementary students, educators\/staff, and their households is not well known.","158":"Inducing latency reversal to reveal infected cells to the host immune system represents a potential strategy to cure HIV infection. In separate studies, we have previously shown that CD8+ T cells may contribute to the maintenance of viral latency and identified a novel SMAC mimetic\/IAP inhibitor (AZD5582) capable of reversing HIV\/SIV latency in vivo by activating the non-canonical (nc) NF-\u03baB pathway. Here, we use AZD5582 in combination with antibody-mediated depletion of CD8\u03b1+ cells to further evaluate the role of CD8+ T cells in viral latency maintenance. Six rhesus macaques (RM) were infected with SIVmac239 and treated with ART starting at week 8 post-infection. After 84-85 weeks of ART, all animals received a single dose of the anti-CD8\u03b1 depleting antibody (Ab), MT807R1 (50mg\/kg, s.c.), followed by 5 weekly doses of AZD5582 (0.1 mg\/kg, i.v.). Following CD8\u03b1 depletion + AZD5582 combined treatment, 100% of RMs experienced on-ART viremia above 60 copies per ml of plasma. In comparator groups of ART-suppressed SIV-infected RMs treated with AZD5582 only or CD8\u03b1 depletion only, on-ART viremia was experienced by 56% and 57% of the animals respectively. Furthermore, the frequency of increased viremic episodes during the treatment period was greater in the CD8\u03b1 depletion + AZD5582 group as compared to other groups. Mathematical modeling of virus reactivation suggested that, in addition to viral dynamics during acute infection, CD8\u03b1 depletion influenced the response to AZD5582. This work suggests that the latency reversal induced by activation of the ncNF-\u03baB signaling pathway with AZD5582 can be enhanced by CD8\u03b1+ cell depletion.","159":"Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in high-risk groups is an effective strategy for TB control and elimination in low incidence settings. A nine-month course of daily isoniazid (INH) has been the longest prescribed therapy; however, completion rates are suboptimal. We need data to guide TB program outreach efforts to optimize LTBI treatment completion rates.We pooled seven (2009-2015) years of LTBI treatment outcome data. We computed the probability of INH treatment disruption over time by patient demographic and clinical risk factors. We used log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models to assess the risk factors for treatment disruption.In this analysis of INH treatment outcome, we see high levels of treatment discontinuation. On average, patients defaulted on their prescribed nine-month daily INH therapy within 30\u2009days of initiating treatment, and those at increased risk of progression to active disease were most likely to do so. We highlight the need to introduce patient-centered programs to increase treatment\u00a0adherence in this population.We analyzed data from 12,495 persons with complete data on INH treatment initiation. Pediatric cases (0-17\u2009years), recent contacts of active TB patients, and non-U.S.-born adults living in the United States \u22645\u2009years represented 25.2, 13.0, and 59.2% of the study population, respectively. Overall, 48.4% failed to complete therapy. The median treatment duration was 306\u2009days (95% CI: 297, 315). A significant drop in adherence could be observed around day 30 of treatment initiation. Indeed, by day 30 of treatment, 17.0% (95% CI: 16.4, 17.7) of patients had defaulted on therapy. Pediatric patients (HR\u2009=\u20090.83, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.89), recent contacts (HR\u2009=\u20090.74, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.81), patients with diabetes (HR\u2009=\u20090.77, 95% CI: 0.60, 0.98), and patients with\u00a0HIV (HR\u2009=\u20090.39, 95% CI: 0.30, 0.51) had a lower risk of treatment default. However, black patients (HR\u2009=\u20091.57, 95% CI: 1.44, 1.70), Hispanic patients (HR\u2009=\u20091.54, 95% CI: 1.43, 1.66), and non-U.S.-born persons living in the United States \u22645\u2009years (HR\u2009=\u20091.25, 95% CI: 1.18, 1.32) were significantly more likely to default on therapy.","160":"RR2-10.1186\/s12889-018-5790-1.In total, 2920 caregivers from 20 eligible preschools participated, with 1510 in the intervention group and 1410 in the control group. The 6-month attrition rate differed significantly between the two groups (P<.001), at 28.9% (437\/1510) in the intervention group and 35.7% (503\/1410) in the control group. For the intervention group, the only significant predictor of attrition risk was participants who learned fewer knowledge segments (aOR 2.69, 95% CI 1.19-6.09). For the control group, significant predictors of attrition risk were lower monthly login frequency (aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.00-2.18), learning fewer knowledge segments (aOR 1.70, 95% CI 1.02-2.81), and shorter learning durations during app engagement (aOR 2.39, 95% CI 1.11-5.15). Demographic characteristics were unrelated to attrition.We explored factors associated with attrition of study participants in an mHealth randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating an intervention to reduce unintentional child injury risk in China.Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR-IOR-17010438; http:\/\/www.chictr.org.cn\/showproj.aspx?proj=17376.The cluster RCT compared two groups of an app-based intervention for caregivers of 3-6-year-old children (Bao Hu San). The intervention group received unintentional child injury and parenting education, whereas only parenting education was implemented in the control group. The trial included 2920 study participants in Changsha, China, and lasted 6 months. Data on participant engagement (using the app) were collected electronically throughout the 6-month period. Associations between participant attrition and demographic characteristics, and between attrition and intervention engagement were tested and quantified separately for the intervention and control groups using the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) based on generalized linear mixed models.Mobile health (mHealth) interventions offer great potential to reach large populations and improve public health. However, high attrition rates threaten evaluation and implementation of mHealth intervention studies.Engagement in the app intervention was associated with participant attrition. Researchers and practitioners should consider how to best engage participants in app-based interventions to reduce attrition.","161":"It is often possible to model the dynamics of biological systems as a series of discrete transitions between a finite set of observable states (or compartments). When the residence times in each state, or inter-event times more generally, are exponentially distributed, then one can write a set of ordinary differential equations, which accurately describe the evolution of mean quantities. Non-exponential inter-event times can also be experimentally observed, but are more difficult to analyse mathematically. In this paper, we focus on the computation of first passage events and their probabilities in biological systems with non-exponential inter-event times. We show, with three case studies from Molecular Immunology, Virology and Epidemiology, that significant errors are introduced when drawing conclusions based on the assumption that inter-event times are exponentially distributed. Our approach allows these errors to be avoided with the use of phase-type distributions that approximate arbitrarily distributed inter-event times.","162":"The top 100 publications were published between 1993 and 2019.

Temperature seasonality, annual precipitation, and mammalian richness were the three most important contributors to the spatial distributions of most of the 26 predominant mosquito species. The model-predicted suitable habitats are 60-664% larger in size than what have been observed, indicating the possibility of severe under-detection. The spatial distribution of major mosquito species in China is likely to be under-estimated by current field observations. More active surveillance is needed to investigate the mosquito species in specific areas where investigation is missing but model-predicted probability is high.","164":"We included 70 publications in our analysis, comprising 1657 individual patients.

Our multivariable analysis uncovered differences in the probability of multiple variant infection by exposure route. Relative to a baseline of male-to-female transmission, the predicted probability for female-to-male multiple variant transmission was significantly lower at 0\u00b713 (95% CI 0\u00b708-0\u00b720), and the probabilities were significantly higher for transmissions in people who inject drugs (0\u00b737 [0\u00b724-0\u00b753]) and men who have sex with men (0\u00b730 [0\u00b733-0\u00b740]). There was no significant difference in the probability of multiple variant transmission between male-to-female transmission (0\u00b721 [0\u00b714-0\u00b731]), post-partum transmission (0\u00b718 [0\u00b703-0\u00b757]), pre-partum transmission (0\u00b717 [0\u00b708-0\u00b733]), and intra-partum transmission (0\u00b727 [0\u00b714-0\u00b745]).We identified that transmissions in people who inject drugs and men who have sex with men are significantly more likely to result in an infection initiated by multiple founder variants, and female-to-male infections are significantly less probable. Quantifying how the routes of HIV infection affect the transmission of multiple variants allows us to better understand how the evolution and epidemiology of HIV-1 determine clinical outcomes.Medical Research Council Precision Medicine Doctoral Training Programme and a European Research Council Starting Grant.HIV-1 infections initiated by multiple founder variants are characterised by a higher viral load and a worse clinical prognosis than those initiated with single founder variants, yet little is known about the routes of exposure through which transmission of multiple founder variants is most probable. Here we used individual patient data to calculate the probability of multiple founders stratified by route of HIV exposure and study methodology.We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that estimated founder variant multiplicity in HIV-1 infection, searching MEDLINE, Embase, and Global Health databases for papers published between Jan 1, 1990, and Sept 14, 2020. Eligible studies must have reported original estimates of founder variant multiplicity in people with acute or early HIV-1 infections, have clearly detailed the methods used, and reported the route of exposure. Studies were excluded if they reported data concerning people living with HIV-1 who had known or suspected superinfection, who were documented as having received pre-exposure prophylaxis, or if the transmitting partner was known to be receiving antiretroviral treatment. Individual patient data were collated from all studies, with authors contacted if these data were not publicly available. We applied logistic meta-regression to these data to estimate the probability that an HIV infection is initiated by multiple founder variants. We calculated a pooled estimate using a random effects model, subsequently stratifying this estimate across exposure routes in a univariable analysis. We then extended our model to adjust for different study methods in a multivariable analysis, recalculating estimates across the exposure routes. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020202672.","165":"Two decomposition methods have been widely used to attribute death differences between two populations to population size, age structure of the population, and age-specific mortality rate (ASMR), but their properties remain uninvestigated.The three decomposition methods differ fundamentally in their allocation of interactions to the contributions of the three factors. In comparison with the existing methods, the new method is robust to the choice of the reference group. Three case studies showed inconsistent attribution results for the two existing methods but robust results for the new method when the choice of the reference population changes.The proposed method offers robust and more justifiable attribution results compared to the two existing methods. This method could be generalized to attribution of group differences of other health indicators.We assess how the two established decomposition methods yield varying results with three-factor factorial experimental designs, illustrating that they are sensitive to the choice of the reference group. We then propose a novel decomposition method to obtain robust decomposition results and use three cases to demonstrate its advantage.","166":"We estimate that, over the first 2\u2009years of pandemic, the IAR ranged between 15% and 40% (range of 95%CI: 11%-61%), with a peak value in the second half of 2020. The IHR, IIR, and IFR consistently decreased throughout the pandemic with 22-44-fold reductions between the initial phase and the Omicron period. At the end of the study period, we estimate an IHR of 0.24% (95%CI: 0.17-0.36), IIR of 0.015% (95%CI: 0.011-0.023), and IFR of 0.05% (95%CI: 0.04-0.08).The difficulty in identifying SARS-CoV-2 infections has not only been the major obstacle to control the COVID-19 pandemic but also to quantify changes in the proportion of infections resulting in hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or death.Since 2021, changes in the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant, vaccination rollout, and the shift of infection to younger ages have reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection ascertainment. The same factors, combined with the improvement of patient management and care, contributed to a massive reduction in the severity and fatality of COVID-19.We developed a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and vaccination informed by official estimates of the time-varying reproduction number to estimate infections that occurred in Italy between February 2020 and 2022. Model outcomes were compared with the Italian National surveillance data to estimate changes in the SARS-CoV-2 infection ascertainment ratio (IAR), infection hospitalization ratio (IHR), infection ICU ratio (IIR), and infection fatality ratio (IFR) in five different sub-periods associated with the dominance of the ancestral lineages and Alpha, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 variants.","167":"We found high cross-sectional network degree at both cell and block levels, indicative of substantial daily contacts. While mean degree increased with age, older residents exhibited lower degree during the Omicron peak, suggesting potential quarantine measures. Block-level networks demonstrated higher mean degrees than cell-level networks. Cumulative degree distributions for both levels increased from January to April, indicating heightened contacts after the outbreak. Assortative age mixing was strong, especially for residents aged 20-29. Dynamic network statistics illustrated increased degrees over time, emphasizing the potential for disease spread, albeit with a lower growth rate during the Omicron peak.The contact networks within the Fulton County Jail presented ideal conditions for infectious disease transmission. Despite some reduction in network characteristics during the Omicron peak, the potential for disease spread remained high. Age-specific mixing patterns suggested unintentional age segregation, potentially limiting disease spread to older residents. The study underscores the need for ongoing monitoring of contact networks in carceral settings and provides valuable insights for epidemic modeling and intervention strategies, including quarantine, depopulation, and vaccination. This network analysis offers a foundation for understanding disease dynamics in carceral environments.In custodial settings such as jails and prisons, infectious disease transmission is heightened by factors such as overcrowding and limited healthcare access. Specific features of social contact networks within these settings have not been sufficiently characterized, especially in the context of a large-scale respiratory infectious disease outbreak. The study aims to quantify contact network dynamics within the Fulton County Jail in Atlanta, Georgia, to improve our understanding respiratory disease spread to informs public health interventions.As part of the Surveillance by Wastewater and Nasal Self-collection of Specimens (SWANSS) study, jail roster data were utilized to construct social contact networks. Rosters included resident details, cell locations, and demographic information. This analysis involved 6,702 residents over 140,901 person days. Network statistics, including degree, mixing, and turnover rates, were assessed across age groups, race\/ethnicities, and jail floors. We compared outcomes for two distinct periods (January 2022 and April 2022) to understand potential responses in network structures during and after the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant peak.","168":"Nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) is a condition that results in the overflow of tears (epiphora) or infection of the nasolacrimal sac (dacryocystitis). The etiology of acquired NLDO is multifactorial and is not fully understood. Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is the surgical correction of NLDO, which aims to establish a new drainage pathway between the lacrimal sac and the nose. The success of DCR is variable; the most common cause of failure is fibrosis and stenosis of the surgical ostium. Antimetabolites such as mitomycin-C (MMC) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) have been shown to be safe and effective in reducing fibrosis and improving clinical outcomes in other ophthalmic surgery settings (e.g. glaucoma and cornea surgery). Application of antimetabolites at the time of DCR has been studied, but the utility of these treatments remains uncertain.We included 31 studies in the review, of which 23 (1309 participants) provided data relating to our primary and secondary outcomes. Many of the 23 studies evaluated functional success, while others also assessed our secondary outcomes of anatomic success or ostium size, or both. Study characteristics Participant characteristics varied across studies, with the age of participants ranging from 30 to 70 years. Participants were predominantly women. These demographics correspond to those most frequently affected by nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Almost all of the studies utilized MMC as the antimetabolite, with only one using 5-FU. We assessed most trials as at unclear risk of bias for most domains. Conflicts of interest were not frequently reported, although the antimetabolites used are generic medications, and studies were not likely to be conducted for financial interest. Findings Twenty studies provided data on the primary outcome of functional success, of which 7 (356 participants) provided data at 6 months and 14 (909 participants) provided data beyond 6 months. At six months, the results showed no evidence of effect of antimetabolite on functional success (risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.29; low-certainty evidence). Beyond six months, the results favored the antimetabolite group (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.25; moderate-certainty evidence). Fourteen studies reported data on the secondary outcome of anatomic success, of which 4 (306 participants) reported data at 6 months and 12 (831 participants) provided data beyond 6 months. Results at six months showed no evidence of effect of antimetabolite on anatomic success (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11; low-certainty evidence). Beyond six months, participants in the antimetabolite group were more likely to achieve anatomic success than those receiving DCR alone (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.15; moderate-certainty evidence). At six months and beyond six months follow-up, two studies reported mean change in ostium size. We did not conduct meta-analysis for the various follow-up periods due to clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity. However, point estimates from these studies at six months consistently favored participants in the antimetabolite group (low-certainty evidence). Beyond six months, while point estimates from one study favored participants in the antimetabolite group, estimates from another study showed no evidence of a difference between the two groups. The certainty of evidence at both time points was low. Adverse events Adverse events were rare. One study reported that one participant in the MMC group experienced delayed wound healing. Other studies reported no significant adverse events related to the application of antimetabolites.We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from the included studies using an electronic data collection form.Primary objective: To determine if adjuvant treatment with antimetabolites improves functional success in the setting of DCR compared to DCR alone. Secondary objectives: To determine if anatomic success of DCR is increased with the use of antimetabolites, and if the surgical ostium is larger in participants treated with antimetabolites.We searched the Cochrane Register for Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eye and Vision Trials Register) (2019, Issue 9), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com, PubMed, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches. We last searched the electronic databases on 6 September 2019.We only included randomized controlled trials. Eligible studies were those that compared the administration of antimetabolites of any dose and concentration versus placebo or another active treatment in participants with NLDO undergoing primary DCR and reoperation. We only included studies that had enrolled adults 18 years or older. We also included studies that used silicone intubation as part of the DCR procedure.There is moderate-certainty evidence that application of antimetabolites at the time of DCR increases functional and anatomic success of DCR when patients are followed for more than six months after surgery, but no evidence of a difference at six months, low-certainty of evidence. There is low-certainty evidence that combining antimetabolite with DCR increases the size of the lacrimal ostium at six months. However, beyond six months, the evidence remain uncertain. Adverse effects of the application of antimetabolites were minimal.","169":"Current mitigation strategies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rely on population-wide adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Collecting demographically and geographically resolved data on NPIs and their association with SARS-CoV-2 infection history can provide critical information related to reopening geographies.Using a rapid cost-efficient approach, we highlight the role of movement and social distancing on SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk. Continued monitoring of NPI uptake, access to testing, and the subsequent impact on SARS-CoV-2 transmission will be critical for pandemic control and decisions about reopening geographies.Median age of the sample was 43 years and 45% were men; Whites and Blacks\/African Americans represented 60% and 23%, respectively. Overall, 96% of the sample reported traveling outside their home for non-employment related services: most commonly cited reasons were essential services (92%) and visiting friends\/family (66%). Use of public transport was reported by 18% of respondents. 68% reported always social distancing indoors and 53% always wearing masks indoors; indoor social distancing was significantly less common among younger vs. older individuals, and race\/ethnicity and income were significantly associated with mask use (p<0.05 for all). 55 participants (5.3%) self-reported ever testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with strong dose-response relationships between movement frequency and SARS-CoV-2 positivity that were significantly attenuated by social distancing. In multivariable analysis, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was negatively associated with the practice of social distancing (adjusted Odd Ratio [aOR]: 0.10; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.03 - 0.33); the only travel associated with higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection was use of public transport (aOR for 7 or more times vs. never: 4.29) and visiting a place of worship (aOR for 3 or more times vs. never: 16.0) after adjusting for social distancing.We sampled 1,030 individuals in Maryland from June 17 - June 28, 2020 to capture socio-demographically and geographically resolved information about NPI adoption, access to SARS-CoV-2 testing, and examine associations with self-reported SARS-CoV-2 positivity.","170":"Streptococcus mitis is a leading cause of infective endocarditis (IE). However, our understanding of the genomic epidemiology and pathogenicity of IE-associated S. mitis is hampered by low IE incidence. Here we use whole genome sequencing of 129 S. mitis bloodstream infection (BSI) isolates collected between 2001-2016 from clinically diagnosed IE cases in the UK to investigate genetic diversity, antimicrobial resistance, and pathogenicity. We show high genetic diversity of IE-associated S. mitis with virtually all isolates belonging to distinct lineages indicating no predominance of specific lineages. Additionally, we find a highly variable distribution of known pneumococcal virulence genes among the isolates, some of which are overrepresented in disease when compared to carriage strains. Our findings suggest that S. mitis in patients with clinically diagnosed IE is not primarily caused by specific hypervirulent or antimicrobial resistant lineages, highlighting the accidental pathogenic nature of S. mitis in patients with clinically diagnosed IE.","171":"Targeting surveillance resources toward individuals at high risk of early infection can accelerate the detection of emerging outbreaks. However, it is unclear which individuals are at high risk without detailed data on interpersonal and physical contacts. We propose a data-driven COVID-19 surveillance strategy using Electronic Health Record (EHR) data that identifies the most vulnerable individuals who acquired the earliest infections during historical influenza seasons. Our simulations for all three networks demonstrate that the EHR-based strategy performs as well as the most-connected strategy. Compared to the random acquaintance surveillance, our EHR-based strategy detects the early warning signal and peak timing much earlier. On average, the EHR-based strategy has 9.8 days of early warning and 13.5 days of peak timings, respectively, before the whole population. For the urban network, the expected values of our method are better than the random acquaintance strategy (24% for early warning and 14% in-advance for peak time). For a scale-free network, the average performance of the EHR-based method is 75% of the early warning and 109% in-advance when compared with the random acquaintance strategy. If the contact structure is persistent enough, it will be reflected by their history of infection. Our proposed approach suggests that seasonal influenza infection records could be used to monitor new outbreaks of emerging epidemics, including COVID-19. This is a method that exploits the effect of contact structure without considering it explicitly.","172":" lines. A comprehensive study of the structure and dynamics of the US professoriate would elucidate the effects of these efforts and the processes that shape scholarship more broadly. Here we analyse the academic employment and doctoral education of tenure-track faculty at all PhD-granting US universities over the decade 2011-2020, quantifying stark inequalities in faculty production, prestige, retention and gender. Our analyses show universal inequalities in which a small minority of universities supply a large majority of faculty across fields, exacerbated by patterns of attrition and reflecting steep hierarchies of prestige. We identify markedly higher attrition rates among faculty trained outside the United States or employed by their doctoral university. Our results indicate that gains in women's representation over this decade result from demographic turnover and earlier changes made to hiring, and are unlikely to lead to long-term gender parity in most fields. These analyses quantify the dynamics of US faculty hiring and retention, and will support efforts to improve the organization, composition and scholarship of the US academic workforce.","173":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in a marked decrease in the number of patient visits for acute myocardial infarction and delayed patient response and intervention in several countries. This study evaluated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of patients, patient response time (pain-to-door), and intervention time (door-to-balloon) for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Patients with STEMI or NSTEMI visiting a hospital in South Korea who underwent primary coronary intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic (January 29, 2020, to December 31, 2020) were compared with those in the equivalent period from 2018 to 2019. Patient response and intervention times were compared for the COVID-19 pandemic window (2020) and the equivalent period from 2018 to 2019. We observed no decrease in the number of patients with STEMI (P = .88) and NSTEMI (P = 1.00) during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to that in the previous years. Patient response times (STEMI: P = .39; NSTEMI: P = .59) during the overall COVID-19 pandemic period did not differ significantly. However, we identified a significant decrease in door-to-balloon time among patients with STEMI (14%; P < .01) during the early COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the number of patients with STEMI and NSTEMI was consistent during the COVID-19 pandemic and that no time delays in patient response and intervention occurred. However, the door-to-balloon time among patients with STEMI significantly reduced during the early COVID-19 pandemic, which could be attributed to decreased emergency care utilization during the early pandemic.","174":"During early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, forecasts provided actionable information about disease transmission to public health decision-makers. Between February and May 2020, experts in infectious disease modeling made weekly predictions about the impact of the pandemic in the U.S. We aggregated these predictions into consensus predictions. In March and April 2020, experts predicted that the number of COVID-19 related deaths in the U.S. by the end of 2020 would be in the range of 150,000 to 250,000, with scenarios of near 1m deaths considered plausible. The wide range of possible future outcomes underscored the uncertainty surrounding the outbreak's trajectory. Experts' predictions of measurable short-term outcomes had varying levels of accuracy over the surveys but showed appropriate levels of uncertainty when aggregated. An expert consensus model can provide important insight early on in an emerging global catastrophe.","175":"We augmented an agent-based SSA HIV model with maternal health parameters including unintended pregnancy, abortion, and maternal mortality. Based on a previous market analysis, we assumed a primary DPP user population of current oral contraceptive users ages 25-49, and alternative user populations in different risk groups (age 15-24, sex workers, HIV-serodiscordant couples) and baseline product use profiles (unmet need for contraception, oral PrEP use, condom use). In three geographies (western Kenya, Zimbabwe, South Africa), we estimated HIV infections averted, pregnancies averted, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) over a 30-year time horizon, assuming equivalent adherence to the DPP as to oral contraceptives, higher adherence, or lower adherence.The DPP has the potential to be cost-effective and cost-saving in populations at substantial HIV risk. Outcomes are sensitive to adherence, implying that effective counseling and decision-making tools for users considering the DPP will be essential. More research is needed to understand real-life adherence patterns and ensure health benefits achieved from contraception alone are not lost.The DPP is likely to be a cost-effective alternative to oral PrEP among users in need of contraception. Among women not already using PrEP, the DPP is likely to be cost-saving in sex workers and serodiscordant couples. The DPP is unlikely to be cost-effective in oral contraceptive users in the general population. Switching from oral contraception to the DPP could be net harmful in some settings and populations if it were to substantially reduces adherence to oral contraception. Results were robust to a range of time horizons or discount rates.Women in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) experience the world's highest rates of both HIV infection and unintended pregnancy. The Dual Prevention Pill (DPP) is a novel multipurpose prevention technology (MPT) that co-formulates HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and combined hormonal oral contraception into a single daily pill. As a dual indication product, the DPP may be preferred by women facing these overlapping health risks. However, most SSA countries face severe healthcare resource constraints. Research is needed to assess whether, in what populations, and in what use cases the DPP would be cost-effective.","176":"The early clinical evidence indicates an increase in vertebral fractures, hypocalcemia, vitamin D deficiencies, and a loss in BMD among COVID-19 patients. Additionally, lower BMD is associated with more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Preclinical models have shown bone loss and increased osteoclastogenesis. The bone loss associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection could be the result of many factors that directly affect the bone such as higher inflammation, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, recruitment of Th17 cells, the hypoxic environment, and changes in RANKL\/OPG signaling. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 infection can exert indirect effects on the skeleton, as mechanical unloading may occur with severe disease (e.g., bed rest) or with BMI loss and muscle wasting that has also been shown to occur with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Muscle wasting can also cause systemic issues that may influence the bone. Medications used to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection also have a negative effect on the bone. Lastly, SARS-CoV-2 infection may also worsen conditions such as diabetes and negatively affect kidney function, all of which could contribute to bone loss and increased fracture risk. SARS-CoV-2 can negatively affect the bone through multiple direct and indirect mechanisms. Future work will be needed to determine what patient populations are at risk of COVID-19-related increases in fracture risk, the mechanisms behind bone loss, and therapeutic options.\u00a0This review article is part of a series of multiple manuscripts designed to determine the utility of using artificial intelligence for writing scientific reviews.SARS-CoV-2 drove the catastrophic global phenomenon of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in a multitude of systemic health issues, including bone loss. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent findings related to bone loss and potential mechanisms.","177":"Over one hundred implementation studies of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are completed, underway or planned. We synthesized evidence from these studies to inform mathematical modelling of the prevention cascade for oral and long-acting PrEP in the setting of western Kenya, one of the world's most heavily HIV-affected regions.We incorporated steps of the PrEP prevention cascade - uptake, adherence, retention and re-engagement after discontinuation - into EMOD-HIV, an open-source transmission model calibrated to the demography and HIV epidemic patterns of western Kenya. Early PrEP implementation research from East Africa was used to parameterize prevention cascades for oral PrEP as currently implemented, delivery innovations for oral PrEP, and future long-acting PrEP. We compared infections averted by PrEP at the population level for different cascade assumptions and sub-populations on PrEP. Analyses were conducted over the 2020 to 2040 time horizon, with additional sensitivity analyses for the time horizon of analysis and the time when long-acting PrEP becomes available.Implementation challenges along the prevention cascade compound to diminish the population-level impact of oral PrEP. Long-acting PrEP is expected to be less impacted by user uptake and adherence, but it is instead dependent on product availability in the short term and retention in the long term. To maximize the impact of long-acting PrEP, ensuring timely product approval and rollout is critical. Research is needed on strategies to improve retention and patterns of PrEP re-initiation.The maximum impact of oral PrEP diminished by over 98% across all prevention cascades, with the exception of long-acting PrEP under optimistic assumptions about uptake and re-engagement after discontinuation. Long-acting PrEP had the highest population-level impact, even after accounting for possible delays in product availability, primarily because its effectiveness does not depend on drug adherence. Retention was the most significant cascade step reducing the potential impact of long-acting PrEP. These results were robust to assumptions about the sub-populations receiving PrEP, but were highly influenced by assumptions about re-initiation of PrEP after discontinuation, about which evidence was sparse.","178":"Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a tremendous burden on public health. RSV infects humans within two years of life and causes continual infections throughout their lifetime. RSV is estimated to cause approximately 30 million episodes of acute lower respiratory infection resulting in over 100,000 deaths annually (in children ages 0 \u0096 5 alone). Despite this burden, no vaccine is currently available for RSV. RSV has been classified into two subtypes (A and B) based on genomic and antigenic properties. Evolutionary rates are similar to other RNA viruses with estimates of 1.83\u00961.95 x 10\u22123 nucleotide substitutions\/site\/year. The high mutation rates of RSV produce an evolutionary landscape that has led to genetic and antigenic variation across and within subtypes. The attachment glycoprotein (G-protein) is must abundant on the surface of the virus and contains an almost completely conserved region, the central conserved domain (CCD). We developed a computational model of the humoral immune system that simulates B cell responses to G-protein antigen. We use a sequence-based approach to approximate antigenic differences across (>1000) RSV strains. We then use computer simulations to identify an immunization strategy that can boost antibody levels to the CCD region. Last, we demonstrate that the immunization strategy results in a highly cross-reactive antibody response.","179":"The introduction of highly effective direct-acting antiviral therapy has changed the hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment paradigm. However, a recent update on HCV epidemiology in incarcerated settings is necessary to accurately determine the extent of the problem, provide information to policymakers and public healthcare, and meet the World Health Organization's goals by 2030. This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to determine the prevalence of HCV Ab and RNA in incarcerated settings.Ninety-two unique sources reporting data for 36 countries were included. The estimated prevalence of HCV Ab ranged from 0.3% to 74.4%. HCV RNA prevalence (available in 46 sources) ranged from 0% to 56.3%. Genotypes (available in 19 sources) 1(a) and 3 were most frequently reported in incarcerated settings. HCV\/HIV coinfection (available in 36 sources) was highest in Italy, Estonia, Pakistan, and Spain. Statistical analysis revealed that almost all observed heterogeneity reflects real differences in prevalence between studies, considering I2 was very high in the meta-analysis.HCV in incarcerated settings is still a significant problem with a higher prevalence than in the general population. It is of utmost importance to start screening for HCV (Ab and RNA) in incarcerated settings to give clear, reliable and recent figures to plan further treatment. This is all in the context of meeting the 2030 WHO targets which are only less than a decade away.PROSPERO: CRD42020162616.For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science for papers published between January 2013 and August 2021. We included studies with information on the prevalence of HCV Ab or RNA in incarcerated settings. A random-effects meta-analysis was done to calculate the pooled prevalence and meta-regression to explore heterogeneity.","180":"The ecology and life history of wild animals influences their potential to harbour infectious disease. This observation has motivated studies identifying empirical relationships between traits of wild animals and historical patterns of spillover and emergence into humans. Although these studies have identified compelling broad-scale patterns, they are generally agnostic with respect to underlying mechanisms. Here, we develop mathematical models that couple reservoir population ecology with viral epidemiology and evolution to clarify existing verbal arguments and pinpoint the conditions that favour spillover and emergence. Our results support the idea that average lifespan influences the likelihood of an animal serving as a reservoir for human infectious disease. At the same time, however, our results show that the magnitude of this effect is sensitive to the rate of viral mutation. Our results also demonstrate that viral pathogens causing persistent infections or a transient immune response within the reservoir are more likely to fuel emergence. Genetically explicit stochastic simulations enrich these mathematical results by identifying relationships between the genetic basis of transmission and the risk of spillover and emergence. Together, our results clarify the scope of applicability for existing hypotheses and refine our understanding of emergence risk.","181":"Recent studies have shown that the repeated evolution of similar phenotypes in response to similar ecological conditions (here \"parallel evolution\") often occurs through mutations in the same genes. However, many previous studies have focused on known candidate genes in a limited number of systems. Thus, the question of how often parallel phenotypic evolution is due to parallel genetic changes remains open. Here, we used quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in F2 intercrosses between lake and stream threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from four independent watersheds on Vancouver Island, Canada to determine whether the same QTL underlie divergence in the same phenotypes across, between, and within watersheds. We find few parallel QTL, even in independent crosses from the same watershed or for phenotypes that have diverged in parallel. These findings suggest that different mutations can lead to similar phenotypes. The low genetic repeatability observed in these lake-stream systems contrasts with the higher genetic repeatability observed in other stickleback systems. We speculate that differences in evolutionary history, gene flow, and\/or the strength and direction of selection might explain these differences in genetic parallelism and emphasize that more work is needed to move beyond documenting genetic parallelism to identifying the underlying causes.","182":"Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is a bacterial pathogen that causes listeriosis in immunocompromised individuals, particularly pregnant women. Several virulence factors support the intracellular lifecycle of Lm and facilitate cell-to-cell spread, allowing it to occupy multiple niches within the host and cross-protective barriers, including the placenta. One family of virulence factors, internalins, contributes to Lm pathogenicity by inducing specific uptake and conferring tissue tropism. Over 25 internalins have been identified thus far, but only a few have been extensively studied. Internalins contain leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains that enable protein-protein interactions, allowing Lm to bind host proteins. Notably, other Listeria species express internalins but cannot colonize human hosts, prompting questions regarding the evolution of internalins within the genus Listeria. Internalin P (InlP) promotes placental colonization through interaction with the host protein afadin. Although prior studies of InlP have begun to elucidate its role in Lm pathogenesis, there remains a lack of information regarding homologs in other Listeria species. Here, we have used a computational evolutionary approach to identify InlP homologs in additional Listeria species. We found that Listeria ivanovii londoniensis (Liv) and Listeria seeligeri (Ls) encode InlP homologs. We also found InlP-like homologs in Listeria innocua and the recently identified species Listeria costaricensis. All newly identified homologs lack the full-length LRR6 and LRR7 domains found in Lm's InlP. These findings are informative regarding the evolution of one key Lm virulence factor, InlP, and serve as a springboard for future evolutionary studies of Lm pathogenesis as well as mechanistic studies of Listeria internalins.","183":"In 2018-2019, New York City experienced the largest measles outbreak in the United States in nearly three decades. To identify key contributing factors, we modeled the transmission dynamics of this outbreak. Results indicate that delayed vaccination of 1- to 4-year-olds enabled the initial spread and that increased infectious contact, likely via \"measles parties,\" facilitated later transmission. We found that around half of infants were susceptible by age 1 and thus had many infections. Without the implemented vaccination campaigns, numbers of infections and hospitalizations could have been >10 times higher and would predominantly affect those under 4. These results suggest that a first vaccine dose before age 1 and the second dose before age 4 could allow parents to vaccinate and protect children more effectively should a high level of vaccine hesitancy persist. Enhanced public health education is needed to reduce activities that unnecessarily expose children to measles and other infections.","184":"Host-parasite coevolution may lead to patterns of local adaptation in either the host or parasite. For parasites with complex multi-host life cycles, this coevolution may be more challenging as they must adapt to multiple geographically varying hosts. The tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus exhibits some local adaptation to its second intermediate host, threespine stickleback, to which the parasite is strictly specialized. However, the tapeworm's adaptation to its first intermediate host (any of a number of copepod species) is not documented. We investigated if there was local adaptation and host specify in the tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus to its copepod first intermediate hosts. We exposed copepods from five lakes in Vancouver Island (BC, Canada) to local (i.e. same lake) and foreign tapeworms in a reciprocal exposure experiment. Results indicate that the tapeworm is not locally adapted to the copepods. Instead, we observed moderate-effect host specificity, infection rates being higher in certain copepod species than in others. Infection rates also varied among cestode populations. These results show that although S.\u2009solidus infects multiple copepod genera, they are not equally competent hosts. Differences in S.\u2009solidus epidemiology among lakes is likely to be driven more by this partial specialization, than by local adaptation to first intermediate hosts.","185":"Accounting for programmatic and childcare costs, \"test to stay\" policies achieve similar model-projected transmission to quarantine policies, with reduced overall costs. Weekly universal screening prevents approximately 50% of in-school transmission, with a lower projected societal cost than hybrid or remote schooling. The cost per infection averted in students and staff by weekly screening is lower for older students and schools with higher mitigation and declines as community transmission rises. In settings where local student incidence is unknown or rapidly changing, surveillance may trigger detection of moderate-to-large in-school outbreaks with fewer resources compared to screening.We used an agent-based network model to simulate transmission in elementary and middle school communities, parameterized to a US school structure and assuming dominance of the delta COVID-19 variant. We assess the value of different strategies for testing students and faculty\/staff, including expanded diagnostic testing (\"test to stay\" policies that take the place of isolation for symptomatic students or quarantine for exposed classrooms); screening (routinely testing asymptomatic individuals to identify infections and contain transmission); and surveillance (testing a random sample of students to signaling undetected transmission and trigger additional investigation or interventions).\"Test to stay\" policies and\/or screening tests can facilitate consistent in-person school attendance with low transmission risk across a range of community incidence. Surveillance may be a useful reduced-cost option for detecting outbreaks and identifying school environments that may benefit from increased mitigation.In March 2021, the Biden administration allocated $10 billion for COVID-19 testing in schools. We evaluate the costs and benefits of testing strategies to reduce the infection risks of full-time in-person K-8 education at different levels of community incidence.We project 30-day cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection; proportion of cases detected; proportion of planned and unplanned days out of school; and the cost of testing programs and of childcare costs associated with different strategies. For screening policies, we further estimate cost per SARS-CoV-2 infection averted in students and staff, and for surveillance, probability of correctly or falsely triggering an outbreak response at different incidence and attack rates.","186":"Network embeddings have become very popular in learning effective feature representations of networks. Motivated by the recent successes of embeddings in natural language processing, researchers have tried to find network embeddings in order to exploit machine learning algorithms for mining tasks like node classification and edge prediction. However, most of the work focuses on distributed representations of nodes that are inherently ill-suited to tasks such as community detection which are intuitively dependent on subgraphs. Here, we formulate subgraph embedding problem based on two intuitive properties of subgraphs and propose Sub2Vec, an unsupervised algorithm to learn feature representations of arbitrary subgraphs. We also highlight the usability of Sub2Vec by leveraging it for network mining tasks, like community detection and graph classification. We show that Sub2Vec gets significant gains over state-of-the-art methods. In particular, Sub2Vec offers an approach to generate a richer vocabulary of meaningful features of subgraphs for representation and reasoning.","187":"Identifying determinants of health and understanding their role in health production constitutes an important research theme. We aimed to document the state of recent multi-country research on this theme in the literature.Sixty studies were selected, out of an original yield of 3686. Life-expectancy and overall mortality were the most widely used population health indicators, while determinants came from the areas of healthcare, culture, politics, socio-economics, environment, labor, fertility, demographics, life-style, and psychology. The family of regression models was the predominant statistical approach. Results from our multidimensional scaling showed that a relatively tight core of determinants have received much attention, as main covariates of interest or controls, whereas the majority of other determinants were studied in very limited contexts. We consider findings from these studies regarding the importance of any given health determinant inconclusive at present. Across a multitude of model specifications, different country samples, and varying time periods, effects fluctuated between statistically significant and not significant, and between beneficial and detrimental to health.We conclude that efforts to understand the underlying mechanisms of population health are far from settled, and the present state of research on the topic leaves much to be desired. It is essential that future research considers multiple factors simultaneously and takes advantage of more sophisticated methodology with regards to quantifying health as well as analyzing determinants' influence.We followed the PRISMA-ScR guidelines to systematically identify, triage and review literature (January 2013-July 2019). We searched for studies that performed cross-national statistical analyses aiming to evaluate the impact of one or more aggregate level determinants on one or more general population health outcomes in high-income countries. To assess in which combinations and to what extent individual (or thematically linked) determinants had been studied together, we performed multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis.","188":"We examined whether a high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine was more efficacious in preventing hospitalizations than a standard-dose vaccine in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) senior population.We evaluated 104965 standard-dose and 125776 high-dose recipients; matching decreased the population to 49091 standard-dose and 24682 high-dose recipients. The matched, PERR-adjusted rVE was 25% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2%-43%) against influenza- or pneumonia-associated hospitalization, 7% (95% CI, -2% to 14%) against all-cause hospitalization, 14% (95% CI, -8% to 32%) against influenza- or pneumonia-associated outpatient visit, 5% (95% CI, 2%-8%) against all-cause outpatient visit, and 38% (95% CI, -5% to 65%) against laboratory-confirmed influenza.This study estimated the relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of high dose versus standard dose using a retrospective cohort of VHA patients 65 years of age or older in the 2015-2016 influenza season. To adjust for measured confounders, we matched each high-dose recipient with up to 4 standard-dose recipients vaccinated at the same location within a 2-week period and having 2 or more pre-existing medical comorbidities. We used the previous event rate ratio method (PERR), a type of difference-in-differences analysis, to adjust for unmeasured confounders.In protecting senior VHA patients against influenza- or pneumonia-associated hospitalization, a high-dose influenza vaccine is more effective than a standard-dose vaccine.","189":" vector. Phylogeographic inference of temporal and spatial virus relationships showed that this variant emerged within the East, Central, and South African lineage between 2005 and 2008, most probably in India. It was also in India where the first large outbreak caused by this virus appeared, in New Delhi, 2010. More importantly, our results also showed that this variant is no longer contained to India. We found it present in several major outbreaks, including the 2016 outbreaks in Pakistan and Kenya, and the 2017 outbreak in Bangladesh. Thus, this variant may have a capability of driving large CHIKV outbreaks in different regions of the world. Our results point to the importance of continued genomic-based surveillance and prompt urgent vector competence studies to assess the level of vector susceptibility and virus transmission, and the impact this might have on this variant's epidemic potential and global spread.","190":"Persistently infecting viruses remain within infected cells for a prolonged period of time without killing the cells and can reproduce via budding virus particles or passing on to daughter cells after division. The ability for populations of infected cells to be long-lived and replicate viral progeny through cell division may be critical for virus survival in examples such as HIV latent reservoirs, tumor oncolytic virotherapy, and non-virulent phages in microbial hosts. We consider a model for persistent viral infection within a replicating cell population with time delay in the eclipse stage prior to infected cell replicative form. We obtain reproduction numbers that provide criteria for the existence and stability of the equilibria of the system and provide bifurcation diagrams illustrating transcritical (backward and forward), saddle-node, and Hopf bifurcations, and provide evidence of homoclinic bifurcations and a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. We investigate the possibility of long term survival of the infection (represented by chronically infected cells and free virus) in the cell population by using the mathematical concept of robust uniform persistence. Using numerical continuation software with parameter values estimated from phage-microbe systems, we obtain two parameter bifurcation diagrams that divide parameter space into regions with different dynamical outcomes. We thus investigate how varying different parameters, including how the time spent in the eclipse phase, can influence whether or not the virus survives.","191":"Malaria remains a major burden on global health, with roughly 200 million cases worldwide and more than 400,000 deaths per year. Besides biomedical research and political efforts, modern information technology is playing a key role in many attempts at fighting the disease. One of the barriers toward a successful mortality reduction has been inadequate malaria diagnosis in particular. To improve diagnosis, image analysis software and machine learning methods have been used to quantify parasitemia in microscopic blood slides. This article gives an overview of these techniques and discusses the current developments in image analysis and machine learning for microscopic malaria diagnosis. We organize the different approaches published in the literature according to the techniques used for imaging, image preprocessing, parasite detection and cell segmentation, feature computation, and automatic cell classification. Readers will find the different techniques listed in tables, with the relevant articles cited next to them, for both thin and thick blood smear images. We also discussed the latest developments in sections devoted to deep learning and smartphone technology for future malaria diagnosis.","192":"In the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), community health workers (CHWs) are a key component of malaria elimination strategies. As malaria declines, support for, and uptake of, malaria services may also subsequently decrease. Expanding their roles beyond malaria has been proposed to sustain the services. A systematic review was conducted to identify and characterize programmes with CHWs providing services in addition to those for malaria in the Asia Pacific. This review describes the expanded roles, identifies evidence of impact or success of the programmes, and explores strategies to ensure sustainability and factors for effective implementation to inform the design of malaria CHW programmes. Searches were conducted in 6 databases, for grey literature, and in bibliographies of retrieved articles. Data were extracted from 38 published articles, 12 programme reports, and 4 programme briefs and analysed using thematic coding and descriptive analysis. Twenty-nine programmes were identified with CHWs performing both malaria and non-malaria roles in the Asia Pacific. There was evidence of impact on malaria incidence in 4 of these, none on malaria mortality, and 4 on other diseases. Monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, multi-sectoral stakeholder collaborations, and adequate training and consistent supervision of CHWs were key to effective programme implementation. Integration of programmes into broader health services, ongoing political and funding support, and engagement with local communities were found to contribute to sustaining provision of health services by CHWs. Expanding CHW roles depends on programme management and strengthening linkages with local health systems. To sustain malaria CHW services, countries need adequate policies and financing, and sufficiently strong health systems to deliver basic health services that are adapted to the health needs of the community which means transitioning away from vertical disease programs. Further research should explore programmes that have not been captured in this review and address gaps in measuring malaria outcomes.","193":"We estimated that a single follow-up examination at the end of the first year after treatment completion combined with 12 months of secondary IPT would avert 2472 DALYs (95% UI -888 to 7801) over a 10-year period and is expected to be cost-saving compared with current control efforts. Sustained annual follow-up and continuous secondary IPT beyond the first year after treatment would avert an additional 1179 DALYs (-1769 to 4377) over 10 years at an expected additional cost of US$18\u00b72 per DALY averted. Strategies of follow-up without secondary IPT were dominated (ie, expected to result in lower health impact at higher costs) by strategies that included secondary IPT.We developed a transmission-dynamic mathematical model and calibrated it to data from two high-incidence communities of approximately 40\u2008000 people in suburban Cape Town, South Africa. We used the model to estimate overall cost and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) associated with annual follow-up examinations and secondary isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), alone and in combination, among individuals completing tuberculosis treatment. We investigated scenarios under which these interventions were restricted to the first year after treatment completion, or extended indefinitely. For each intervention scenario, we projected health system costs and DALYs averted with respect to the current status quo of tuberculosis control. All estimates represent mean values derived from 1000 epidemic trajectories simulated over a 10-year period (2019-28), with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) calculated as the 2\u00b75th and 97\u00b75th percentile values.National Institutes of Health, G\u00fcnther Labes Foundation, Oskar Helene Heim Foundation.In settings of high tuberculosis incidence, previously treated individuals remain at high risk of recurrent tuberculosis and contribute substantially to overall disease burden. Whether tuberculosis case finding and preventive interventions among previously treated people are cost-effective has not been established. We aimed to estimate costs and health benefits of annual post-treatment follow-up examinations and secondary preventive therapy for tuberculosis in a tuberculosis-endemic setting.In this high-incidence setting, post-treatment follow-up and secondary preventive therapy can accelerate declines in tuberculosis incidence and potentially save resources for tuberculosis control. Empirical trials to assess the feasibility of these interventions in settings most severely affected by tuberculosis are needed.","194":" The microbiome is critical to host health and disease, but much remains unknown about the determinants, levels, and evolution of host-microbial diversity. The relationship between hosts and their associated microbes is complex. Most studies to date have focused on the gut microbiome; however, large gaps remain in our understanding of host-microbial diversity, coevolution, and levels of variation in microbiomes across multiple body sites and host species. To better understand the patterns of variation and evolutionary context of host-microbial communities, we conducted one of the largest comparative studies to date, which indicated that the oral microbiome was distinct from the microbiomes of all other body sites and convergent across host species, suggesting conserved niche specialization within the Primates order. We also show the importance of host species differences in shaping the microbiome within specific body sites. This large, comparative study contributes valuable information on key patterns of variation among hosts and body sites, with implications for understanding host-microbial dynamics and human-microbial coevolution.","195":"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) viral load (VL) is used as a biomarker to assess risk of disease progression, and to determine eligibility for treatment. While there is a well recognised association between VL and the expression of the viral e-antigen protein, the distributions of VL at a population level are not well described. We here present cross-sectional, observational HBV VL data from two large population cohorts in the UK and in South Africa, demonstrating a consistent bimodal distribution. The right skewed distribution and low median viral loads are different from the left-skew and higher viraemia in seen in HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) cohorts in the same settings. Using longitudinal data, we present evidence for a stable 'set-point' VL in peripheral blood during chronic HBV infection. These results are important to underpin improved understanding of HBV biology, to inform approaches to viral sequencing, and to plan public health interventions.","196":"Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an emergent arthropod-borne virus that causes an acute febrile illness accompanied by arthralgia, similar to chikungunya virus. Increasing urbanization of MAYV outbreaks in the Americas has led to concerns for geographic expansion and spillover. Given the potential importance of this pathogen, we sought to fill critical gaps in knowledge regarding MAYV infectivity and geographic variation. This study describes the cytopathogenicity of MAYV in human dermal fibroblasts, human skeletal muscle satellite cells, human embryonic kidney cells (HEK), peripherally derived human macrophages, and Vero cells. We found that regional differences between these viruses do not affect replication kinetics, with high titers peaking at 37\u00a0h post infection. MAYV-U, did however, cause the most cytopathic effect in a time-dependent manner. Compared to the other two prototypic isolates, MAYV-U harbors unique mutations in the E2 protein, D60G and S205F, that are likely to interact with the host cell receptor and could affect infectivity. We further demonstrate that pre-treatment of cells with interferon-\u03b2 inhibited viral replication in a dose-dependent manner. Together, these findings advance our understanding of MAYV infection of human target cells and provide initial data regarding variation according to geography.","197":"Phylogenetic comparative analysis is an approach to inferring evolutionary process from a combination of phylogenetic and phenotypic data. The last few years have seen increasingly sophisticated models employed in the evaluation of more and more detailed evolutionary hypotheses, including adaptive hypotheses with multiple selective optima and hypotheses with rate variation within and across lineages. The statistical performance of these sophisticated models has received relatively little systematic attention, however. We conducted an extensive simulation study to quantify the statistical properties of a class of models toward the simpler end of the spectrum that model phenotypic evolution using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. We focused on identifying where, how, and why these methods break down so that users can apply them with greater understanding of their strengths and weaknesses. Our analysis identifies three key determinants of performance: a discriminability ratio, a signal-to-noise ratio, and the number of taxa sampled. Interestingly, we find that model-selection power can be high even in regions that were previously thought to be difficult, such as when tree size is small. On the other hand, we find that model parameters are in many circumstances difficult to estimate accurately, indicating a relative paucity of information in the data relative to these parameters. Nevertheless, we note that accurate model selection is often possible when parameters are only weakly identified. Our results have implications for more sophisticated methods inasmuch as the latter are generalizations of the case we study. ","198":"The observed impact of varying location-specific snail inputs sheds light on the diverse MDA response patterns noted in operational research on schistosomiasis control, such as the recent SCORE project. Efficiency of human-to-snail transmission is likely to be much higher than predicted by standard models, which, in practice, will make local elimination by implementation of MDA alone highly unlikely, even over a multi-decade period.Schistosomiasis is a chronic parasitic trematode disease that affects over 240 million people worldwide. The Schistosoma lifecycle is complex, involving transmission via specific intermediate-host freshwater snails. Predictive mathematical models of Schistosoma transmission have often chosen to simplify or ignore the details of environmental human-snail interaction in their analyses. Schistosome transmission models now aim to provide better precision for policy planning of elimination of transmission. This heightens the importance of including the environmental complexity of vector-pathogen interaction in order to make more accurate projections.We propose a nonlinear snail force of infection (FOI) that takes into account an intermediate larval stage (miracidium) and snail biology. We focused, in particular, on the effects of snail force of infection (FOI) on the impact of mass drug administration (MDA) in human communities. The proposed (modified) model was compared to a conventional model in terms of their predictions. A longitudinal dataset generated in Kenya field studies was used for model calibration and validation. For each sample community, we calibrated modified and conventional model systems, then used them to model outcomes for a range of MDA regimens. In most cases, the modified model predicted more vigorous post-MDA rebound, with faster relapse to baseline levels of infection. The effect was pronounced in higher risk communities. When compared to observed data, only the modified system was able to successfully predict persistent rebound of Schistosoma infection.","199":"Our results show that closing down the schools in the town where an outbreak begins and the town with the highest in degree centrality provides the largest reduction in percent of runs leading to an outbreak as well as a reduction in the geographic spread of the outbreak compared to only closing down the town where the outbreak begins. Although closing down schools in the town with the closest proximity to the town where the outbreak begins also provides a reduction in the chance of an outbreak, we do not find the reduction to be as large as when the schools in the high in degree centrality town are closed.To test the effects of a school closure policy on the spread of an infectious disease (in this case measles) we run simulations closing schools based on either the proximity of the town to the initial outbreak or the centrality of the town within the network of towns in the simulation. To do this we use a hybrid model that combines an agent-based model with an equation-based model. In our analysis, we use three measures to compare the effects of different intervention strategies: the total number of model runs leading to an outbreak, the total number of infected agents, and the geographic spread of outbreaks.In order to be prepared for an infectious disease outbreak it is important to know what interventions will or will not have an impact on reducing the outbreak. While some interventions might have a greater effect in mitigating an outbreak, others might only have a minor effect but all interventions will have a cost in implementation. Estimating the effectiveness of an intervention can be done using computational modelling. In particular, comparing the results of model runs with an intervention in place to control runs where no interventions were used can help to determine what interventions will have the greatest effect on an outbreak.Thus we believe that focusing on high in degree centrality towns during an outbreak is important in reducing the overall size of an outbreak.","200":"Wastewater-based disease surveillance is a promising approach for monitoring community outbreaks. Here we describe a nationwide campaign to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in the wastewater of 159 counties in 40 U.S. states, covering 13% of the U.S. population from February 18 to June 2, 2020. Out of 1,751 total samples analyzed, 846 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with overall viral concentrations declining from April to May. Wastewater viral titers were consistent with, and appeared to precede, clinical COVID-19 surveillance indicators, including daily new cases. Wastewater surveillance had a high detection rate (>80%) of SARS-CoV-2 when the daily incidence exceeded 13 per 100,000 people. Detection rates were positively associated with wastewater treatment plant catchment size. To our knowledge, this work represents the largest-scale wastewater-based SARS-CoV-2 monitoring campaign to date, encompassing a wide diversity of wastewater treatment facilities and geographic locations. Our findings demonstrate that a national wastewater-based approach to disease surveillance may be feasible and effective.","201":" (95% CI, 63 to 154). CD4 count at switch increased slightly over time (+10 CD4 cells\/year; 95% CI, 2 to 19). During the same period, the mean delay between confirmation of VF and switch was 530 days, with no significant decline over time (-14 days\/year; 95% CI, -58 to 52).VF in Africa remains an event recognized late in HIV infection, a problem compounded by ongoing delays between VF and second-line switch.The late recognition of virologic failure (VF) places persons with HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa at risk for HIV transmission, disease progression, and death. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine if the recognition and response to VF in the region has improved.We searched for studies reporting CD4 count at confirmed VF or at switch to second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). Using a random-effects metaregression model, we analyzed temporal trends in CD4 count at VF-or at second-line ART switch-over time. We also explored temporal trends in delay between VF and switch to second-line ART.","202":"There are many cases within epidemiology where infections compete to persist within a population. In studying models for such cases, one of the goals is to determine which infections can invade a population and persist when other infections are already resident within the population. Invasion reproductive numbers (IRN), which are tied to the stability of boundary endemic equilibria, can address this question. By reinterpreting resident infections epidemiologically, this study extends methods for finding IRNs to periodic systems, and presents some examples which illustrate the often complex computations required. Results identify conditions under which a simple time-average can be used to derive IRNs, and apply the methods to examine how seasonal fluctuations in influenza incidence facilitate the year-round persistence of bacterial respiratory infections.","203":"Malarial infections have long been recognized as a driver of human evolution, as demonstrated by the influence of Plasmodium falciparum on sickle-cell anemia persistence. Duffy-negativity is another blood disorder thought to have been selected because it confers nearly complete resistance against Plasmodium vivax infection. Recent evidence suggests that the benefits of being Duffy-negative cannot be expected to play a strong selective pressure on humans, whereas its costs cannot be considered as negligible. Here, we suggest that the cross-talk between P. falciparum and P. vivax in coinfected children could represent the most parsimonious explanation of the frequency of Duffy-negativity. We discuss how this new hypothesis could be tested and call for a reconsideration of the evolution of the Duffy-negative group.","204":"Most COVID-19 vaccines require two doses, however with limited vaccine supply, policymakers are considering single-dose vaccination as an alternative strategy. Using a mathematical model combined with optimization algorithms, we determined optimal allocation strategies with one and two doses of vaccine under various degrees of viral transmission. Under low transmission, we show that the optimal allocation of vaccine vitally depends on the single-dose efficacy. With high single-dose efficacy, single-dose vaccination is optimal, preventing up to 22% more deaths than a strategy prioritizing two-dose vaccination for older adults. With low or moderate single-dose efficacy, mixed vaccination campaigns with complete coverage of older adults are optimal. However, with modest or high transmission, vaccinating older adults first with two doses is best, preventing up to 41% more deaths than a single-dose vaccination given across all adult populations. Our work suggests that it is imperative to determine the efficacy and durability of single-dose vaccines, as mixed or single-dose vaccination campaigns may have the potential to contain the pandemic much more quickly.","205":"Serological results obtained in a single laboratory from twin-studies on maternal immunisation, in Vietnam and Belgium offer the opportunity to compare antibody kinetics in infants before and after infant vaccination in the presence of vaccine-induced maternal antibodies. Nonlinear mixed-effects models (NLMMs) making use of a hypothesised dynamic evolution that captures the change in antibody titres over time, were employed to model anti-PT and anti-Prn antibody dynamics. Our proposed modelling approach provided useful insight into understanding the differences in the infants' antibody kinetics in both countries since NLMMs offer the possibility of pooling all data in one analysis and incorporate relevant covariates of interest. In both controlled cohort studies, pregnant women were vaccinated with a tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine (Boostrix\u00ae, Belgium; Adacel\u00ae, Vietnam), and children were followed before and after primary vaccination, and before and after booster vaccination (Infanrix hexa\u00ae). From our models, both anti-PRN and anti-PT antibody titres at birth of Vietnamese infants were significantly lower than those of Belgian infants born to vaccinated women groups. Even though the antibody titres in the cord at birth of Belgian infants were also higher than those of Vietnamese infants born to the control women groups, the difference was not significant. The significant difference between infants born to vaccinated women in the two countries was likely due to the use of different vaccine brands in pregnant women and the different vaccination histories of women in these two countries. Our analyses also suggested that the blunting effect was present during the primary immunisation but went away afterward for anti-PT data. In contrast, for anti-PRN antibodies, the blunting effect persisted after the primary vaccination and possibly went away after the booster dose. Countries should be aware of the regional situation in view of recommending maternal immunization.","206":"The control of mosquito populations with insecticide treated bed nets and indoor residual sprays remains the cornerstone of malaria reduction and elimination programs. In light of widespread insecticide resistance in mosquitoes, however, alternative strategies for reducing transmission by the mosquito vector are urgently needed, including the identification of safe compounds that affect vectorial capacity via mechanisms that differ from fast-acting insecticides. Here, we show that compounds targeting steroid hormone signaling disrupt multiple biological processes that are key to the ability of mosquitoes to transmit malaria. When an agonist of the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) is applied to Anopheles gambiae females, which are the dominant malaria mosquito vector in Sub Saharan Africa, it substantially shortens lifespan, prevents insemination and egg production, and significantly blocks Plasmodium falciparum development, three components that are crucial to malaria transmission. Modeling the impact of these effects on Anopheles population dynamics and Plasmodium transmission predicts that disrupting steroid hormone signaling using 20E agonists would affect malaria transmission to a similar extent as insecticides. Manipulating 20E pathways therefore provides a powerful new approach to tackle malaria transmission by the mosquito vector, particularly in areas affected by the spread of insecticide resistance.","207":"This study therefore estimated the seroprevalence of Q-fever and associated risk factors of exposure in people and their livestock. exposure and risk-factors among people and their livestock are scarce. 0.724) despite high animal exposure levels, suggesting that Q-fever exposure in humans may be occurring at a scale larger than households.We conducted a cross-sectional study in pastoralist communities in Marsabit County in northern Kenya. A total of 1,074 women and 225 children were enrolled and provided blood samples for Q-fever testing. Additionally, 1,876 goats, 322 sheep and 189 camels from the same households were sampled. A structured questionnaire was administered to collect individual- and household\/herd-level data. Indirect IgG ELISA kits were used to test the samples.The one health approach used in this study revealed that Q-fever is endemic in this setting. Longitudinal studies of Q-fever burden and risk factors simultaneously assessed in human and animal populations as well as the socioeconomic impacts of the disease and further explore the role of environmental factors in Q-fever epidemiology are required. Such evidence may form the basis for designing Q-fever prevention and control strategies.","208":"Somalia is a complex and fragile setting with a demonstrated potential for disruptive, high-burden measles outbreaks. In response, since 2018, Somalian authorities have partnered with UNICEF and the WHO to implement measles vaccination campaigns across the country. In this paper, we create a Somalia-specific model of measles transmission based on a comprehensive epidemiological dataset including case-based surveillance, vaccine registries, and serological surveys. We use this model to assess the impact of these campaign interventions on Somalian's measles susceptibility, showing, for example, that across the roughly 10 million doses delivered, 1 of every 5 immunized a susceptible child. Finally, we use the model to explore a counter-factual epidemiology without the 2019-2020 campaigns, and we estimate that those interventions prevented over 10,000 deaths.","209":"Gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT, sleeping sickness) is one of several neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) where there is evidence of asymptomatic human infection but there is uncertainty of the role it plays in transmission and maintenance. To explore possible consequences of asymptomatic infections, particularly in the context of elimination of transmission-a goal set to be achieved by 2030-we propose a novel dynamic transmission model to account for the asymptomatic population. This extends an established framework, basing infection progression on a number of experimental and observation gHAT studies. Asymptomatic gHAT infections include those in people with blood-dwelling trypanosomes, but no discernible symptoms, or those with parasites only detectable in skin. Given current protocols, asymptomatic infection with blood parasites may be diagnosed and treated, based on observable parasitaemia, in contrast to many other diseases for which treatment (and\/or diagnosis) may be based on symptomatic infection. We construct a model in which exposed people can either progress to either asymptomatic skin-only parasite infection, which would not be diagnosed through active screening algorithms, or blood-parasite infection, which is likely to be diagnosed if tested. We add extra parameters to the baseline model including different self-cure, recovery, transmission and detection rates for skin-only or blood infections. Performing sensitivity analysis suggests all the new parameters introduced in the asymptomatic model can impact the infection dynamics substantially. Among them, the proportion of exposures resulting in initial skin or blood infection appears the most influential parameter. For some plausible parameterisations, an initial fall in infection prevalence due to interventions could subsequently stagnate even under continued screening due to the formation of a new, lower endemic equilibrium. Excluding this scenario, our results still highlight the possibility for asymptomatic infection to slow down progress towards elimination of transmission. Location-specific model fitting will be needed to determine if and where this could pose a threat.","210":"Lassa virus is a significant burden on human health throughout its endemic region in West Africa, with most human infections the result of spillover from the primary rodent reservoir of the virus, the natal multimammate mouse, M. natalensis. Here we develop a Bayesian methodology for estimating epidemiological parameters of Lassa virus within its rodent reservoir and for generating probabilistic predictions for the efficacy of rodent vaccination programs. Our approach uses Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to integrate mechanistic mathematical models, remotely-sensed precipitation data, and Lassa virus surveillance data from rodent populations. Using simulated data, we show that our method accurately estimates key model parameters, even when surveillance data are available from only a relatively small number of points in space and time. Applying our method to previously published data from two villages in Guinea estimates the time-averaged R0 of Lassa virus to be 1.74 and 1.54 for rodent populations in the villages of Bantou and Tanganya, respectively. Using the posterior distribution for model parameters derived from these Guinean populations, we evaluate the likely efficacy of vaccination programs relying on distribution of vaccine-laced baits. Our results demonstrate that effective and durable reductions in the risk of Lassa virus spillover into the human population will require repeated distribution of large quantities of vaccine.","211":" species' roles are conserved by treating species' utilization of this two-dimensional space as continuous, while also classifying species into categorical roles. Both approaches failed to detect the conservation of species' roles for a single species out of over 38 000 host and helminth parasite species. Together, our findings suggest that species' roles in host-helminth networks may not be conserved, pointing to the potential role of spatial and environmental gradients, as well as the importance of the context of the local host and helminth parasite community. This article is part of the theme issue 'Infectious disease macroecology: parasite diversity and dynamics across the globe'.","212":"Drawing on multiple data sources, we assembled a longitudinal national dataset to analyse AMR levels for critical priority antibiotic-bacterium combinations in 39 private and public hospitals (2008-2017) throughout the country and characterize the population at the municipality level. We first described trends of AMR in Chile. Second, we used multivariate regressions to examine the association of AMR with hospital characteristics and community-level socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental factors. Last, we estimated the expected distribution of AMR by region in Chile.Our results show that AMR for priority antibiotic-bacterium pairs steadily increased between 2008 and 2017 in Chile, driven primarily by Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Higher hospital complexity, a proxy for antibiotic use, and poorer local community infrastructure were significantly associated with greater AMR.Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is among the most critical global health threats of the 21st century. AMR is primarily driven by the use and misuse of antibiotics but can be affected by socioeconomic and environmental factors. Reliable and comparable estimates of AMR over time are essential to making public health decisions, defining research priorities, and evaluating interventions. However, estimates for developing regions are scant. We describe the evolution of AMR for critical priority antibiotic-bacterium pairs in Chile and examine their association with hospital and community-level characteristics using multivariate rate-adjusted regressions.This research was supported by the Agencia Nacional de Investigaci\u00f3n y Desarrollo (ANID), Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cient\u00edfico y Tecnol\u00f3gico FONDECYT, The Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR), and Centro UC de Pol\u00edticas P\u00fablicas, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile.Consistent with research in other countries in the region, our results show a worrisome increase in clinically relevant AMR in Chile and suggest that hospital complexity and living conditions in the community may affect the emergence and spread of AMR. Our results highlight the importance of understanding AMR in hospitals and their interaction with the community and the environment to curtail this ongoing public health crisis.","213":"The initial increase in perceived stress was related to daily biofeedback adherence and clinic responsibilities. Treatment group stress then decreased with self-regulation but was difficult to quantify in a small cohort. Larger studies could increase daily self-regulation adherence by improving biofeedback accessibility for leisurely use. Using self-regulation with biofeedback may be an innovative approach to reduce stress and improve job satisfaction in primary care. = 0.03) whose stress then decreased but was not significant. Overall and extrinsic job satisfaction similarly increased but were not significance.Two naturally occurring cohorts of clinicians and nurses were followed over 12 weeks. The treatment group (N = 9) completed 12 weeks of self-regulation with optional clinic-based biofeedback and received peer support for the first half. The control group (N = 9) started a delayed intervention after 6 weeks without peer support. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were conducted.We assessed whether self-regulation with biofeedback is effective at decreasing stress and improving job satisfaction among primary care clinicians and nurses.Burnout in healthcare professions is higher than other careers. An undesirable work-life balance has resulted in declining job satisfaction among primary care physicians. Biofeedback devices teach self-regulation techniques, which reduce stress and increase resilience.","214":" antibiotic resistance. We found that the relative strength and directionality of competition between drug-resistant and drug-sensitive pneumococcal strains was the most important determinant of whether vaccination would promote, inhibit, or have little effect upon the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Last, we show that country-specific differences in pathogen transmission substantially altered the predicted impact of vaccination, highlighting that policies for managing antibiotic resistance with vaccines must be tailored to a specific pathogen and setting.","215":"Sequence classification facilitates a fundamental understanding of the structure of microbial communities. Binary metagenomic sequence classifiers are insufficient because environmental metagenomes are typically derived from multiple sequence sources. Here we introduce a deep-learning based sequence classifier, DeepMicroClass, that classifies metagenomic contigs into five sequence classes, i.e.\u00a0viruses infecting prokaryotic or eukaryotic hosts, eukaryotic or prokaryotic chromosomes, and prokaryotic plasmids. DeepMicroClass achieved high performance for all sequence classes at various tested sequence lengths ranging from 500\u00a0bp to 100 kbps. By benchmarking on a synthetic dataset with variable sequence class composition, we showed that DeepMicroClass obtained better performance for eukaryotic, plasmid and viral contig classification than other state-of-the-art predictors. DeepMicroClass achieved comparable performance on viral sequence classification with geNomad and VirSorter2 when benchmarked on the CAMI II marine dataset. Using a coastal daily time-series metagenomic dataset as a case study, we showed that microbial eukaryotes and prokaryotic viruses are integral to microbial communities. By analyzing monthly metagenomes collected at HOT and BATS, we found relatively higher viral read proportions in the subsurface layer in late summer, consistent with the seasonal viral infection patterns prevalent in these areas. We expect DeepMicroClass will promote metagenomic studies of under-appreciated sequence types.","216":"The metaphors of the Red Queen and the arms race have inspired a large amount of research aimed at understanding the process of antagonistic coevolution between hosts and parasites. One approach that has been heavily used is to estimate the strength of parasite local adaptation using a reciprocal cross infection or transplant study. These studies frequently conclude that the locally adapted species is ahead in the coevolutionary race. Here, I use mathematical models to decompose parasite infectivity into components attributable to local versus global adaptation and to develop a robust index of which species is ahead in the coevolutionary race, which I term coevolutionary advantage. Computer simulations of coevolving host-parasite interactions demonstrate that because the magnitudes of local and global adaptation are largely independent, the link between the sign of local adaptation and coevolutionary advantage is tenuous. A consequence of the weak coupling between local adaptation and coevolutionary advantage is that the bulk of existing empirical studies do not sample enough populations for any reliable conclusions to be drawn. Together, these results suggest that the long-standing conventional wisdom holding that locally adapted parasites are ahead in the coevolutionary race should be reconsidered.","217":"We measured contact patterns using social contact diaries for 157 U.S. long-term care facility employees from December 2020 - June 2021. These data are crucial for analyzing mathematical transmission models and for informing healthcare setting infection control policy.The median number of daily contacts was 10 (IQR 8-11). Household contacts were more likely partially masked than fully masked, more likely to involve physical contact, and longer in duration compared to facility contacts.","218":"With norovirus vaccine candidates currently under development, now is the time to identify the vaccine characteristics and implementation thresholds at which vaccination becomes cost effective and cost saving in a community setting.This study outlines thresholds at which a norovirus vaccine would be cost effective and cost saving in the community when vaccinating children aged <5 years and older adults. Establishing these thresholds can help provide decision makers with targets to consider when developing and implementing a norovirus vaccine.Compared with no vaccination, vaccinating preschool-aged children averted 8%-72% of symptomatic norovirus cases in a community, whereas vaccinating older adults averted 2%-29% of symptomatic cases (varying with vaccine efficacy [25%-75%] and vaccination coverage [10%-80%]). Vaccination with a 25% vaccine efficacy was cost effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio \u2264$50,000 per quality-adjusted life year) when vaccination cost \u2264$445 and cost saving at \u2264$370 when vaccinating preschool-aged children and \u2264$42 and \u2264$30, respectively, when vaccinating older adults. With a 50% vaccine efficacy, vaccination was cost effective when it cost \u2264$1,190 and cost saving at \u2264$930 when vaccinating preschool-aged children and \u2264$110 and \u2264$64, respectively, when vaccinating older adults. These cost thresholds (cost effective and cost saving, respectively) further increased with a 75% vaccine efficacy to \u2264$1,600 and \u2264$1,300 for preschool-aged children and \u2264$165 and \u2264$100 for older adults.In 2020, a norovirus transmission, clinical, and economics computational simulation model representing different U.S. population segments was developed to simulate the spread of norovirus and the potential impact of vaccinating children aged <5 years and older adults (aged \u226565 years).","219":"Increasing incidence of tick-borne human diseases and geographic range expansion of tick vectors elevates the importance of research on characteristics of tick species that transmit pathogens. Despite their global distribution and role as vectors of pathogens such as Rickettsia spp., ticks in the genus Dermacentor Koch, 1844 (Acari: Ixodidae) have recently received less attention than ticks in the genus Ixodes Latreille, 1795 (Acari: Ixodidae). To address this knowledge gap, we compiled an extensive database of Dermacentor tick traits, including morphological characteristics, host range, and geographic distribution. Zoonotic vector status was determined by compiling information about zoonotic pathogens found in Dermacentor species derived from primary literature and data repositories. We trained a machine learning algorithm on this data set to assess which traits were the most important predictors of zoonotic vector status. Our model successfully classified vector species with ~84% accuracy (mean AUC) and identified two additional Dermacentor species as potential zoonotic vectors. Our results suggest that Dermacentor species that are most likely to be zoonotic vectors are broad ranging, both in terms of the range of hosts they infest and the range of ecoregions across which they are found, and also tend to have large hypostomes and be small-bodied as immature ticks. Beyond the patterns we observed, high spatial and species-level resolution of this new, synthetic dataset has the potential to support future analyses of public health relevance, including species distribution modeling and predictive analytics, to draw attention to emerging or newly identified Dermacentor species that warrant closer monitoring for zoonotic pathogens.","220":"Facility-based HIVST is a cost-effective strategy to increase the proportion of men\/youth tested for HIV in Malawi and decreases the human resource requirements for HIV testing in the OPD-providing additional healthcare worker time for other priority healthcare activities.Facility-based HIVST offered year-round resulted in the greatest increase in the proportion of men and youth tested in the OPD (from 45% to 72%-83%), was considered cost-saving for HIVST kit priced at $1.00, and generally reduced required personnel as compared to the status quo. At higher HIVST kit prices, and more relaxed eligibility criteria, all scenarios that considered year-round HIVST in the OPD remained on the cost-effectiveness frontier.A data-driven individual-based model was parameterized with data from a community-representative survey (socio-demographic, health service utilization and HIV testing history) of men and youth in Malawi (data collected August 2019). In total, 79 different strategies for the implementation of HIV self-testing (HIVST) and provider-initiated-testing-and-counselling at the outpatient department (OPD) were evaluated. Outcomes included percent of men\/youth tested for HIV in a 12-month period, cost-effectiveness and human resource requirements. The testing yield was assumed to be constant across the scenarios.Malawi is rapidly closing the gap in achieving the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets, with 90% of people living with HIV in Malawi aware of their status. As we approach epidemic control, interventions to improve coverage will become more costly. There is, therefore, an urgent need to identify innovative and low-cost strategies to maintain and increase testing coverage without diverting resources from other HIV services. The objective of this study is to model different combinations of facility-based HIV testing modalities and determine the most cost-effective strategy to increase the proportion of men and youth testing for HIV.","221":" and modulating ROCK\/YAP\/FOXM1 axis and suggests that targeting this pathway might have potential value in the management of asthma.","222":"There is growing concern about our preparedness for controlling the spread of pandemics such as H1N1 Influenza. The dynamics of epidemic spread in large-scale populations are very complex. Further, human behavior, social contact networks, and pandemics are closely intertwined and evolve as the epidemic spread. Individuals\u0092 changing behaviors in response to public policies and their evolving perception of how an infectious disease outbreak is unfolding can dramatically alter normal social interactions. Effective planning and response strategies must take these complicated interactions into account. Mathematical models are key to understanding the spread of epidemics. In this chapter, we discuss a recent approach of diffusion in network models for studying the complex dynamics of epidemics in large-scale populations. Analyzing these models leads to very challenging computational problems. Further, using these models for forecasting epidemic spread and developing public health policies leads to issues that are characteristic of big data applications. The chapter describes the state of the art in computational and big data epidemiology.","223":"Many public health responses and modeled scenarios for COVID-19 outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV-2 assume that infection results in an immune response that protects individuals from future infections or illness for some amount of time. The presence or absence of protective immunity due to infection or vaccination (when available) will affect future transmission and illness severity. Here, we review the scientific literature on antibody immunity to coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 as well as the related SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs). We reviewed 2,452 abstracts and identified 491 manuscripts relevant to 5 areas of focus: 1) antibody kinetics, 2) correlates of protection, 3) immunopathogenesis, 4) antigenic diversity and cross-reactivity, and 5) population seroprevalence. While further studies of SARS-CoV-2 are necessary to determine immune responses, evidence from other coronaviruses can provide clues and guide future research.","224":"A pertussis vaccination during pregnancy has recently been adopted in several countries to indirectly protect young infants. This study assessed the effect of adding a pertussis component to the tetanus vaccination, in the pregnancy immunization program in Vietnam. A randomized controlled trial was performed. Pregnant women received either a Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria acellular pertussis) vaccine or a tetanus only vaccine between 19 and 35 weeks' gestational age. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) against tetanus (TT), diphtheria (DT), pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemaglutinin (FHA) and pertactin (Prn) were measured using commercial ELISA tests, at baseline, 1 month after maternal vaccination, at delivery, and in infants from cord blood and before and after the primary series (EPI: month 2-3-4) of a pertussis containing vaccine. Significantly higher geometric mean concentrations (GMC) were observed for all 3 measured pertussis antigens in the offspring of the Tdap group, up to 2 months of age. One month after completion of the primary infant vaccination schedule, anti-Prn GMC, but not anti-PT and anti-FHA GMCs, was significantly (p=0.006) higher in the control group. Maternal antibodies induced by vaccination during pregnancy close the susceptibility gap for pertussis in young infants. Limited interference with the infant vaccine responses was observed. Whether this interference effect disappears with the administration of a fourth vaccine dose is further studied. ","225":"Hong Kong Research Grants Council.The comparative performance of different clinical sampling methods for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR among populations with suspected infection remains unclear. This meta-analysis aims to systematically compare the diagnostic performance of different clinical specimen collection methods.Our review suggests that, compared with the gold standard of nasopharyngeal swabs, pooled nasal and throat swabs offered the best diagnostic performance of the alternative sampling approaches for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ambulatory care. Saliva and nasal swabs gave comparable and very good diagnostic performance and are clinically acceptable alternative specimen collection methods. Throat swabs gave a much lower sensitivity and positive predictive value and should not be recommended. Self-collection for pooled nasal and throat swabs and nasal swabs was not associated with any significant impairment of diagnostic accuracy. Our results also provide a useful reference framework for the proper interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 testing results using different clinical specimens.In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SSRN, and Research Square from Jan 1, 2000, to Nov 16, 2020. We included original clinical studies that examined the performance of nasopharyngeal swabs and any additional respiratory specimens for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals presenting in ambulatory care. Studies without data on paired samples, or those that only examined different samples from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases were not useful for examining diagnostic performance of a test and were excluded. Diagnostic performance, including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, was examined using random effects models and double arcsine transformation.\u2009\u226530%) was observed in studies on saliva and nasal swabs.","226":") of 420 nm. SEM and TEM images revealed DSAgNPs were spherical and rod shaped, with a size range of 20 nm and 75 nm. The zeta potential was found to be -15.41 mV. XRD and EDX analyses confirmed the nature and presence of Ag and AgCl. DSAgNPs showed considerable antibacterial activity, exhibited better cytotoxicity against brine shrimp, and shown better photocatalytic activity against methylene blue. Based on the present research work, it can be concluded that DSAgNPs could be used in the field of water treatment, pharmaceuticals, biomedicine, biosensor and nanotechnology in near future.","227":"The study objective was to identify facilitators and barriers of parental attitudes and beliefs toward school-located influenza vaccination in the United States. In 2009, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expanded their recommendations for influenza vaccination to include school-aged children. We conducted a systematic review of studies focused on facilitators and barriers of parental attitudes toward school-located influenza vaccination in the United States from 1990 to 2016. We reviewed 11 articles by use of the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework. Facilitators were free\/low cost vaccination; having belief in vaccine efficacy, influenza severity, and susceptibility; belief that vaccination is beneficial, important, and a social norm; perception of school setting advantages; trust; and parental presence. Barriers were cost; concerns regarding vaccine safety, efficacy, equipment sterility, and adverse effects; perception of school setting barriers; negative physician advice of contraindications; distrust in vaccines and school-located vaccination programs; and health information privacy concerns. We identified the facilitators and barriers of parental attitudes and beliefs toward school-located influenza vaccination to assist in the evidence-based design and implementation of influenza vaccination programs targeted for children in the United States and to improve influenza vaccination coverage for population-wide health benefits.","228":"The Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in Latin America (2015-2016) has primarily been studied in urban centers, with less understanding of its impact on smaller rural communities. To address this gap, we analyzed ZIKV sero-epidemiology in six rural Ecuadorian communities (2018-2019) with varying access to a commercial hub. Seroprevalence ranged from 19% to 54% measured by NS1 blockade of binding ELISA. We observed a decline in ZIKV seroprevalence between 2018 and 2019 that was greater among younger populations, suggesting that the attack rates in the 2015-16 epidemic were significantly higher than our 2018 observations. These data indicate that the 2015-16 epidemic included significant transmission in rural and more remote settings. Our observations of high seroprevalence in our area of study highlights the importance of surveillance and research in rural areas lacking robust health systems to manage future Zika outbreaks and vaccine initiatives.","229":"Our findings simultaneously shed light on both the characteristics of the Delta variant, by identifying key age groups, risk factors, and transmission pathways, and planning a future response effort against SARS-CoV-2.Little is known about the epidemiology, natural history, and transmission patterns of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Delta variant. Monitoring the evolution of viral fitness of SARS-CoV-2 in the host population is key for preparedness and response planning.We analyzed a successfully contained local outbreak of Delta that took place in Hunan, China, and provided estimates of time-to-key event periods, infectiousness over time, and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission for a still poorly understood variant.","230":"In the United States, the relationship between the rates of growth in buprenorphine providers and patients became weaker after 2017. While efforts to increase buprenorphine-waivered providers were successful, there was less success in translating that into significant increases in buprenorphine receipt.All providers who have obtained a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine in the United States, and an estimate of the annual number of patients who had buprenorphine for opioid use disorder (OUD) dispensed to them at a retail pharmacy.From 2003 to 2021, the number of buprenorphine-waivered providers in the United States increased from fewer than 5000 in the first 2\u2009years of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to more than 114\u2009000 in 2021, while patients receiving buprenorphine products for OUD increased from approximately 19\u2009000 to more than 1.4 million. The strength of association between waivered providers and patients is significantly different before and after 2017 (P\u2009<\u20090.001). From 2003 to 2016, for each additional provider, there was an average increase of 32.1 [95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u200928.7-35.6] patients, but an increase of only 4.6 (95% CI=\u20093.5-5.7) patients for each additional provider, beginning in 2017.We synthesized and summarized data from multiple sources to assess the cumulative number of buprenorphine-waivered providers over time. We used national-level prescription data from IQVIA to estimate annual buprenorphine receipt for OUD.We sought to describe longitudinal trends in buprenorphine receipt and buprenorphine-waivered providers in the United States from 2003 to 2021 and measure whether the relationship between the two differed after capacity-building strategies were enacted nationally in 2017. This was a retrospective study of two separate cohorts covering the years 2003-21, testing whether the association between two trends in these cohorts changed comparing 2003 to 2016 and from 2017 to 2021, among buprenorphine providers in the United States, regardless of treatment setting. Patients receiving dispensed buprenorphine at retail pharmacies.","231":"The term \"global health equity\" has become more visible in recent years, yet we were unable to find a formal definition of the term. Our Viewpoint addresses this gap by offering a discussion of this need and proposing a definition. We define global health equity as mutually beneficial and power-balanced partnerships and processes leading to equitable human and environmental health outcomes (which we refer to as \"products\") on a global scale. Equitable partnerships actively work against racism and supremacy. Such partnerships foster processes with these same dynamics; for example, sharing lead authorship responsibilities with meaningful roles for host country researchers to frame relevant questions and to provide context and interpretation for the research findings. Equitable products, such as access to technology and tailored delivery of interventions effective in the specific context, are the fruits of these partnerships and processes.","232":"Bats (order Chiroptera) are some of the most abundant mammals on earth and their species ecology strongly influences zoonotic potential. While substantial research has been conducted on bat-associated viruses, particularly on those that can cause disease in humans and\/or livestock, globally, limited research has focused on endemic bats in the USA. The southwest region of the US is of particular interest because of its high diversity of bat species. We identified 39 single-stranded DNA virus genomes in the feces of Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) sampled in the Rucker Canyon (Chiricahua Mountains) of southeast Arizona (USA). Twenty-eight of these belong to the virus families Circoviridae (n\u00a0=\u00a06), Genomoviridae (n\u00a0=\u00a017), and Microviridae (n\u00a0=\u00a05). Eleven viruses cluster with other unclassified cressdnaviruses. Most of the viruses identified represent new species. Further research on identification of novel bat-associated cressdnaviruses and microviruses is needed to provide greater insights regarding their co-evolution and ecology relative to bats.","233":"In this article, we discuss the structural and practical identifiability of a nested immuno-epidemiological model of arbovirus diseases, where host-vector transmission rate, host recovery, and disease-induced death rates are governed by the within-host immune system. We incorporate the newest ideas and the most up-to-date features of numerical methods to fit multi-scale models to multi-scale data. For an immunological model, we use Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) time-series data obtained from livestock under laboratory experiments, and for an epidemiological model we incorporate a human compartment to the nested model and use the number of human RVFV cases reported by the CDC during the 2006-2007 Kenya outbreak. We show that the immunological model is not structurally identifiable for the measurements of time-series viremia concentrations in the host. Thus, we study the non-dimensionalized and scaled versions of the immunological model and prove that both are structurally globally identifiable. After fixing estimated parameter values for the immunological model derived from the scaled model, we develop a numerical method to fit observable RVFV epidemiological data to the nested model for the remaining parameter values of the multi-scale system. For the given (CDC) data set, Monte Carlo simulations indicate that only three parameters of the epidemiological model are practically identifiable when the immune model parameters are fixed. Alternatively, we fit the multi-scale data to the multi-scale model simultaneously. Monte Carlo simulations for the simultaneous fitting suggest that the parameters of the immunological model and the parameters of the immuno-epidemiological model are practically identifiable. We suggest that analytic approaches for studying the structural identifiability of nested models are a necessity, so that identifiable parameter combinations can be derived to reparameterize the nested model to obtain an identifiable one. This is a crucial step in developing multi-scale models which explain multi-scale data.","234":"Tuberculosis is a major infectious disease worldwide, but currently available diagnostics have suboptimal accuracy, particularly in patients unable to expectorate, and are often unavailable at the point-of-care in resource-limited settings. Test\/treatment decision are, therefore, often made on clinical grounds. We hypothesized that contextual factors beyond disease probability may influence clinical decisions about when to test and when to treat for tuberculosis. This umbrella review aimed to identify such factors, and to develop a framework for uncertainty in tuberculosis clinical decision-making. Systematic reviews were searched in seven databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL Complete, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, PROSPERO, Epistemonikos) using predetermined search criteria. Findings were classified as barriers and facilitators for testing or treatment decisions, and thematically analysed based on a multi-level model of uncertainty in health care. We included 27 reviews. Study designs and primary aims were heterogeneous, with seven meta-analyses and three qualitative evidence syntheses. Facilitators for decisions to test included providers' advanced professional qualification and confidence in tests results, availability of automated diagnostics with quick turnaround times. Common barriers for requesting a diagnostic test included: poor provider tuberculosis knowledge, fear of acquiring tuberculosis through respiratory sampling, scarcity of healthcare resources, and complexity of specimen collection. Facilitators for empiric treatment included patients' young age, severe sickness, and test inaccessibility. Main barriers to treatment included communication obstacles, providers' high confidence in negative test results (irrespective of negative predictive value). Multiple sources of uncertainty were identified at the patient, provider, diagnostic test, and healthcare system levels. Complex determinants of uncertainty influenced decision-making. This could result in delayed or missed diagnosis and treatment opportunities. It is important to understand the variability associated with patient-provider clinical encounters and healthcare settings, clinicians' attitudes, and experiences, as well as diagnostic test characteristics, to improve clinical practices, and allow an impactful introduction of novel diagnostics.","235":"Defining healthcare facility catchment areas is a key step in predicting future healthcare demand in epidemic settings. Forecasts of hospitalisations can be informed by leading indicators measured at the community level. However, this relies on the definition of so-called catchment areas or the geographies whose populations make up the patients admitted to a given hospital, which are often not well-defined. Little work has been done to quantify the impact of hospital catchment area definitions on healthcare demand forecasting.The choice of hospital catchment area definition affected the accuracy of hospital admission forecasts. The definition based on COVID-19 admissions data resulted in the most accurate forecasts at both a 7- and 14-day horizon and was one of the top two best-performing definitions across forecast dates and locations. The \"nearby\" heuristic also performed well, but less consistently than the COVID-19 data definition. The marginal distribution baseline, which did not include any spatial information, was the lowest-ranked definition. The relative performance of the definitions was larger when using case forecasts compared to future observed cases. All results were consistent across spatial scales of the catchment area definitions.We made forecasts of local-level hospital admissions using a scaled convolution of local cases (as defined by the hospital catchment area) and delay distribution. Hospital catchment area definitions were derived from either simple heuristics (in which people are admitted to their nearest hospital or any nearby hospital) or historical admissions data (all emergency or elective admissions in 2019, or COVID-19 admissions), plus a marginal baseline definition based on the distribution of all hospital admissions. We evaluated predictive performance using each hospital catchment area definition using the weighted interval score and considered how this changed by the length of the predictive horizon, the date on which the forecast was made, and by location. We also considered the change, if any, in the relative performance of each definition in retrospective vs. real-time settings, or at different spatial scales.Using catchment area definitions derived from context-specific data can improve local-level hospital admission forecasts. Where context-specific data is not available, using catchment areas defined by carefully chosen heuristics is a sufficiently good substitute. There is clear value in understanding what drives local admissions patterns, and further research is needed to understand the impact of different catchment area definitions on forecast performance where case trends are more heterogeneous.","236":"In response to unprecedented surges in the demand for hospital care during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, health systems have prioritized patients with COVID-19 to life-saving hospital care to the detriment of other patients. In contrast to these ad hoc policies, we develop a linear programming framework to optimally schedule elective procedures and allocate hospital beds among all planned and emergency patients to minimize years of life lost. Leveraging a large dataset of administrative patient medical records, we apply our framework to the National Health Service in England and show that an extra 50,750-5,891,608 years of life can be gained compared with prioritization policies that reflect those implemented during the pandemic. Notable health gains are observed for neoplasms, diseases of the digestive system, and injuries and poisoning. Our open-source framework provides a computationally efficient approximation of a large-scale discrete optimization problem that can be applied globally to support national-level care prioritization policies.","237":"We examined a natural history of opioid overdose deaths from 1999-2021 in the United States to describe state-level spatio-temporal heterogeneity in the waves of the epidemic. We obtained overdose death counts by state from 1999-2021, categorized as involving prescription opioids, heroin, synthetic opioids, or unspecified drugs. We developed a Bayesian multivariate multiple change point model to flexibly estimate the timing and magnitude of state-specific changes in death rates involving each drug type. We found substantial variability around the timing and severity of each wave across states. The first wave of prescription-involved deaths started between 1999 and 2005, the second wave of heroin-involved deaths started between 2010 and 2014, and the third wave of synthetic opioid-involved deaths started between 2014 and 2021. The severity of the second and third waves was greater in states in the eastern half of the country. Our study highlights state-level variation in the timing and severity of the waves of the opioid epidemic by presenting a 23-year natural history of opioid overdose mortality in the United States. While reinforcing the general notion of three waves, we find that states did not uniformly experience the impacts of each wave.","238":"A recent trial showed that universal decolonization in adult intensive care units (ICUs) resulted in greater reductions in all bloodstream infections and clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) than either targeted decolonization or screening and isolation. Since regional health-care facilities are highly interconnected through patient-sharing, focusing on individual ICUs may miss the broader impact of decolonization. Using our Regional Healthcare Ecosystem Analyst simulation model of all health-care facilities in Orange County, California, we evaluated the impact of chlorhexidine baths and mupirocin on all ICU admissions when universal decolonization was implemented for 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of ICU beds countywide (compared with screening and contact precautions). Direct benefits were substantial in ICUs implementing decolonization (a median 60% relative reduction in MRSA prevalence). When 100% of countywide ICU beds were decolonized, there were spillover effects in general wards, long-term acute-care facilities, and nursing homes resulting in median 8.0%, 3.0%, and 1.9% relative MRSA reductions at 1 year, respectively. MRSA prevalence decreased by a relative 3.2% countywide, with similar effects for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. We showed that a large proportion of decolonization's benefits are missed when accounting only for ICU impact. Approximately 70% of the countywide cases of MRSA carriage averted after 1 year of universal ICU decolonization were outside the ICU. ","239":"Our study supports the policy recommendation of IRS usage in a stable and perennial transmission area to rapidly reduce malaria transmission.The study was based upon a dynamic cohort of children aged 0.5-10 years enrolled from August 2011 to June 2017 in Nagongera Subcounty. Confirmed malaria infections and hemoglobin levels were recorded over time for each participant. After each of 4 rounds of IRS, malaria incidence, hemoglobin levels, and parasite density were evaluated and compared with pre-IRS levels. Analyses were carried out at the participant level while accounting for repeated measures and clustering by household.Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is widely used as a vector control measure, although there are conflicting findings of its effectiveness in reducing malaria incidence. The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of multiple IRS rounds on malaria incidence and hemoglobin levels in a cohort of children in rural southeastern Uganda.Incidence rate ratios comparing post-IRS to pre-IRS incidence rates for age groups 0-3, 3-5, and 5-11 were 0.108 (95% confidence interval [CI], .078-.149), 0.173 (95% CI, .136-.222), and 0.226 (95% CI, .187-.274), respectively. The mean hemoglobin levels significantly increased from 11.01 (pre-IRS) to 12.18 g\/dL (post-IRS).","240":"Consistent with results from randomized trials and observational studies in other populations, mRNA vaccines were highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections among incarcerated people. Prioritizing incarcerated people for vaccination, redoubling efforts to boost vaccination, and continuing other ongoing mitigation practices are essential in preventing COVID-19 in this disproportionately affected population.Among 60,707 cohort members, 49% received at least one BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 dose during the study period. Estimated vaccine effectiveness was 74% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64-82%) from day 14 after first dose until receipt of second dose and 97% (95% CI, 88-99%) from day 14 after second dose. Effectiveness was similar among the subset of residents who were medically vulnerable: 74% [95% CI, 62-82%] and 92% [95% CI, 74-98%] from 14 days after first and second doses, respectively.Prisons and jails are high-risk settings for COVID-19. Vaccines may substantially reduce these risks, but evidence is needed on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness for incarcerated people, who are confined in large, risky congregate settings.We conducted a retrospective cohort study to estimate effectiveness of mRNA vaccines, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna), against confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections among incarcerated people in California prisons from December 22, 2020 through March 1, 2021. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation provided daily data for all prison residents including demographic, clinical, and carceral characteristics, as well as COVID-19 testing, vaccination, and outcomes. We estimated vaccine effectiveness using multivariable Cox models with time-varying covariates, adjusted for resident characteristics and infection rates across prisons.","241":"The effect of weather conditions on transmission dynamics was not considered.The timing of implementing and easing social distancing measures has major effects on the number of COVID-19 cases.Agent-based model applied to Dane County, Wisconsin; the Milwaukee metropolitan (metro) area; and New York City (NYC).Different times for implementing and easing social distancing measures at different levels of adherence.The timing of and adherence to social distancing had a major effect on COVID-19 occurrence. In NYC, implementing social distancing measures 1 week earlier would have reduced the total number of confirmed cases from 203\u00a0261 to 41\u00a0366 as of 31 May 2020, whereas a 1-week delay could have increased the number of confirmed cases to 1\u00a0407\u00a0600. A delay in implementation had a differential effect on the number of cases in the Milwaukee metro area versus Dane County, indicating that the effect of social distancing measures varies even within the same state.National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.To determine the effect of social distancing measures in unique regions.An agent-based simulation model.The model represented the social network and interactions among persons in a region, considering population demographic characteristics, limited testing availability, \"imported\" infections, asymptomatic disease transmission, and age-specific adherence to social distancing measures. The primary outcome was the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.Across the United States, various social distancing measures were implemented to control the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the effectiveness of such measures for specific regions with varying population demographic characteristics and different levels of adherence to social distancing is uncertain.Synthetic population at different ages.","242":"Leptospirosis is a widespread and potentially life-threatening zoonotic disease caused by spirochaetes of the genus Leptospira. Humans become infected primarily via contact with environmental reservoirs contaminated by the urine of shedding mammalian hosts. Populations in high transmission settings, such as urban slums and subsistence farming communities, are exposed to low doses of Leptospira on a daily basis. Under these conditions, numerous factors determine whether infection occurs, including the route of exposure and inoculum dose. Skin wounds and abrasions are risk factors for leptospirosis, but it is not known whether broken skin is necessary for spillover, or if low-dose exposures to intact skin and mucous membranes can also cause infection. To establish a quantitative relationship between dose, route and probability of infection, we performed challenge experiments in hamsters and rats, developed mechanistic dose-response models representing the spatial dynamics of within-host infection and persistence, and fitted models to experimental data. Results show intact skin is a strong barrier against infection, and that broken skin is the predominant route by which low-dose environmental exposures cause infection. These results identify skin integrity as a bottleneck to spillover of Leptospira and underscore the importance of barrier interventions in the prevention of leptospirosis. This article is part of the theme issue 'Dynamic and integrative approaches to understanding pathogen spillover'.","243":"Lockdowns alone were predicted to delay the first epidemic peak but could not prevent overwhelming of the health service and were costly in lost working days. Impacts of post-lockdown interventions depended heavily on compliance. Assuming 80% compliance, symptoms-based household quarantining alone could not prevent hospitalisations exceeding capacity, whilst mask-wearing prevented overwhelming health services and was cost-effective given masks of high filtration efficiency. Combining masks with quarantine increased their impact. Recalibration to surging cases in 2021 suggested potential for a further wave in 2021, dependent on uncertainties in case reporting and immunity.Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) used to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission vary in their feasibility, appropriateness and effectiveness in different contexts. In Bangladesh a national lockdown implemented in March 2020 exacerbated poverty and was untenable long-term. A resurgence in 2021 warranted renewed NPIs. We sought to identify NPIs that were feasible in this context and explore potential synergies between interventions.We developed an SEIR model for Dhaka District, parameterised from literature values and calibrated to data from Bangladesh. We discussed scenarios and parameterisations with policymakers with the aid of an interactive app. These discussions guided modelling of lockdown and two post-lockdown measures considered feasible to deliver; symptoms-based household quarantining and compulsory mask-wearing. We compared NPI scenarios on deaths, hospitalisations relative to capacity, working days lost, and cost-effectiveness.Masks and symptoms-based household quarantining synergistically prevent transmission, and are cost-effective in Bangladesh. Our interactive app was valuable in supporting decision-making, with mask-wearing being mandated early, and community teams being deployed to support quarantining across Dhaka. These measures likely contributed to averting the worst public health impacts, but delivering an effective response with consistent compliance across the population has been challenging. In the event of a further resurgence, concurrent messaging to increase compliance with both mask-wearing and quarantine is recommended.","244":"Questionnaires administered at 422 households across 12 communities recorded household-level socio-demographic characteristics and participation in nine protective practices. Household inclusion in the analysis of occupational practices required having livestock and a household member with occupational exposure to livestock (n = 127), and inclusion in analysis of garden practices required having a garden and at least one animal (n = 233). The proportion of households participating in each protective practice was compared across community types through chi-square analyses. Mixed effects logistic regression assessed household-level associations between socio-demographic characteristics and participation in each protective practice.Despite well-recognized recommendations to reduce human exposure to zoonotic pathogens, the use of personal and herd-level protective practices is inconsistent in communities where human interactions with animals are common. This study assessed household-level participation in rodent- (extermination, proper food storage, trash disposal), occupational- (preventive veterinary care, boot-wearing, glove-wearing), and garden-associated (restricting animal access, boot-wearing, glove-wearing) protective practices in farms, villages, and slums in the Los Rios region, Chile, where zoonotic pathogens are endemic.Most households (95.3 %) reported participation in rodent control, and a positive association between the number of rodent signs in a household and rodent extermination was observed (OR: 1.75, 95 % CI: 1.41, 2.16). Occupational protective practices were reported in 61.8 % of eligible households; household size (OR: 1.63, 95 % CI: 1.17, 5.84) and having children (OR: 0.22, 95 % CI: 0.06, 0.78) were associated with preventive veterinary care. Among eligible households, 73.8 % engaged in protective practices when gardening, and species diversity was positively associated with wearing boots (OR: 1.27, 95 % CI: 1.03, 1.56). Household-level participation in all three protective practices within any exposure category was limited (<10.4 %) and participation in any individual protective practice varied considerably within and across community types.The levels of participation in protective practices reported in this study are consistent with descriptions in the literature of imperfect use of methods that reduce human exposure to zoonotic pathogens. The wide differences across communities in the proportion of households participating in protective practices against human exposure to zoonotic pathogens, suggests that future research should identify community-level characteristics that influence household participation in such practices.","245":"Large events and gatherings, particularly those taking place indoors, have been linked to multitransmission events that have accelerated the pandemic spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To provide real-time, geolocalized risk information, we developed an interactive online dashboard that estimates the risk that at least one individual with SARS-CoV-2 is present in gatherings of different sizes in the United States. The website combines documented case reports at the county level with ascertainment bias information obtained via population-wide serological surveys to estimate real-time circulating, per-capita infection rates. These rates are updated daily as a means to visualize the risk associated with gatherings, including county maps and state-level plots. The website provides data-driven information to help individuals and policy makers make prudent decisions (for example, increasing mask-wearing compliance and avoiding larger gatherings) that could help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in hard-hit regions.","246":"From 2011 to 2016, a total of 21,062 malaria cases with 138 deaths were reported, including 91% were imported and 9% were autochthonous. The geographic distribution of local transmission have shrunk dramatically, but there were still more than 10 counties reporting autochthonous cases in 2013-2016, particularly in counties bordering with countries in South-East Asia. The importation from 68 origins countries had an increasing annual trend from Africa but decreasing importation from Southeast Asia. Four distinct communities have been identified in the importation networks with the destinations in China varied by origin and species.Historically, malaria had been a widespread disease in China. A national plan was launched in China in 2010, aiming to eliminate malaria by 2020. In 2017, no indigenous cases of malaria were detected in China for the first time. To provide evidence for precise surveillance and response to achieve elimination goal, a comprehensive study is needed to determine the changing epidemiology of malaria and the challenges towards elimination.Using malaria surveillance data from 2011 to 2016, an integrated series of analyses was conducted to elucidate the changing epidemiological features of autochthonous and imported malaria, and the spatiotemporal patterns of malaria importation from endemic countries.China is on the verge of malaria elimination, but the residual transmission in border regions and the threats of importation from Africa and Southeast Asia are the key challenges to achieve and maintain malaria elimination. Efforts from China are also needed to help malaria control in origin countries and reduce the risk of introduced transmission.","247":"The study has been approved by ethics committees. There is minimal risk to study participants. Participant privacy is protected through the anonymisation of data for analysis, secure data transfer and restricted access. Findings will be disseminated through conferences, journal publications, related policy and research fora, and data may be shared in accordance with data sharing policies of the National Institutes of Health.Globally, recognition is growing of the harmful impacts of high ambient temperatures (heat) on health in pregnant women and children. There remain, however, major evidence gaps on the extent to which heat increases the risks for adverse health outcomes, and how this varies between settings. Evidence gaps are especially large in Africa. We will conduct an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis to quantify the impacts of heat on maternal and child health in sub-Saharan Africa. A detailed understanding and quantification of linkages between heat, and maternal and child health is essential for developing solutions to this critical research and policy area.CRD42022346068.We will use IPD from existing, large, longitudinal trial and cohort studies, on pregnant women and children from sub-Saharan Africa. We will systematically identify eligible studies through a mapping review, searching data repositories, and suggestions from experts. IPD will be acquired from data repositories, or through collaboration with data providers. Existing satellite imagery, climate reanalysis data, and station-based weather observations will be used to quantify weather and environmental exposures. IPD will be recoded and harmonised before being linked with climate, environmental, and socioeconomic data by location and time. Adopting a one-stage and two-stage meta-analysis method, analytical models such as time-to-event analysis, generalised additive models, and machine learning approaches will be employed to quantify associations between exposure to heat and adverse maternal and child health outcomes.","248":"The presence of patients with diverse pathologies in hospitals results in an environment that can be rich in various microorganisms including respiratory and enteric viruses, leading to outbreaks in hospitals or spillover infections to the community. All hospital patients are at risk of nosocomial viral infections, but vulnerable groups such as older adults, children and immuno-compromised\/-suppressed patients are at particular risk of severe outcomes including prolonged hospitalization or death. These pathogens could transmit through direct or indirect physical contact, droplets or aerosols, with increasing evidence suggesting the importance of aerosol transmission in nosocomial infections of respiratory and enteric viruses. Factors affecting the propensity to transmit and the severity of disease transmitted via the aerosol route include the biological characteristics affecting infectivity of the viruses and susceptibility of the host, the physical properties of aerosol particles, and the environmental stresses that alter these properties such as temperature and humidity. Non-specific systematic and individual-based interventions designed to mitigate the aerosol route are available although empirical evidence of their effectiveness in controlling transmission of respiratory and enteric viruses in healthcare settings are sparse. The relative importance of aerosol transmission in healthcare setting is still an on-going debate, with particular challenge being the recovery of infectious viral bioaerosols from real-life settings and the difficulty in delineating transmission events that may also be a result of other modes of transmission. For the prevention and control of nosocomial infections via the aerosol route, more research is needed on identifying settings, medical procedures or equipment that may be associated with an increased risk of aerosol transmission, including defining which procedures are aerosol-generating; and on the effectiveness of systematic interventions on aerosol transmission of respiratory and enteric viruses in healthcare settings.","249":"Dengue is the most common arboviral infection of humans and is a public health burden in more than 100 countries. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes stably infected with strains of the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia are resistant to dengue virus (DENV) infection and are being tested in field trials. To mimic field conditions, we experimentally assessed the vector competence of A. aegypti carrying the Wolbachia strains wMel and wMelPop after challenge with viremic blood from dengue patients. We found that wMelPop conferred strong resistance to DENV infection of mosquito abdomen tissue and largely prevented disseminated infection. wMel conferred less resistance to infection of mosquito abdomen tissue, but it did reduce the prevalence of mosquitoes with infectious saliva. A mathematical model of DENV transmission incorporating the dynamics of viral infection in humans and mosquitoes was fitted to the data collected. Model predictions suggested that wMel would reduce the basic reproduction number, R0, of DENV transmission by 66 to 75%. Our results suggest that establishment of wMelPop-infected A. aegypti at a high frequency in a dengue-endemic setting would result in the complete abatement of DENV transmission. Establishment of wMel-infected A. aegypti is also predicted to have a substantial effect on transmission that would be sufficient to eliminate dengue in low or moderate transmission settings but may be insufficient to achieve complete control in settings where R0 is high. These findings develop a framework for selecting Wolbachia strains for field releases and for calculating their likely impact. ","250":"Although seasonal variation has a known influence on the transmission of several respiratory viral infections, its role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission remains unclear. While there is a sizable and growing literature on environmental drivers of COVID-19 transmission, recent reviews have highlighted conflicting and inconclusive findings. This indeterminacy partly owes to the fact that seasonal variation relates to viral transmission by a complicated web of causal pathways, including many interacting biological and behavioural factors. Since analyses of specific factors cannot determine the aggregate strength of seasonal forcing, we sidestep the challenge of disentangling various possible causal paths in favor of a holistic approach. We model seasonality as a sinusoidal variation in transmission and infer a single Bayesian estimate of the overall seasonal effect. By extending two state-of-the-art models of non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) effects and their datasets covering 143 regions in temperate Europe, we are able to adjust our estimates for the role of both NPIs and mobility patterns in reducing transmission. We find strong seasonal patterns, consistent with a reduction in the time-varying reproduction number R(t) (the expected number of new infections generated by an infectious individual at time t) of 42.1% (95% CI: 24.7%-53.4%) from the peak of winter to the peak of summer. These results imply that the seasonality of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is comparable in magnitude to the most effective individual NPIs but less than the combined effect of multiple interventions.","251":", here we develop a modelling framework that uses daily travel networks to simulate different outbreak and intervention scenarios across China. We estimated that there were a total of 114,325 COVID-19 cases (interquartile range 76,776 - 164,576) in mainland China as of February 29, 2020. Without NPIs, the COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (interquartile range 44 - 94) by February 29, 2020, with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to have prevented more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but combined NPIs achieved the strongest and most rapid effect. The lifting of travel restrictions since February 17, 2020 does not appear to lead to an increase in cases across China if the social distancing interventions can be maintained, even at a limited level of 25% reduction on average through late April. Our findings contribute to an improved understanding of NPIs on COVID-19 and to inform response efforts across the World.","252":"The detection of evolutionary transitions in influenza A (H3N2) viruses' antigenicity is a major obstacle to effective vaccine design and development. In this study, we describe Novel Influenza Virus A Detector (NIAViD), an unsupervised machine learning tool, adept at identifying these transitions, using the HA1 sequence and associated physico-chemical properties. NIAViD performed with 88.9% (95% CI, 56.5-98.0%) and 72.7% (95% CI, 43.4-90.3%) sensitivity in training and validation, respectively, outperforming the uncalibrated null model-33.3% (95% CI, 12.1-64.6%) and does not require potentially biased, time-consuming and costly laboratory assays. The pivotal role of the Boman's index, indicative of the virus's cell surface binding potential, is underscored, enhancing the precision of detecting antigenic transitions. NIAViD's efficacy is not only in identifying influenza isolates that belong to novel antigenic clusters, but also in pinpointing potential sites driving significant antigenic changes, without the reliance on explicit modelling of haemagglutinin inhibition titres. We believe this approach holds promise to augment existing surveillance networks, offering timely insights for the development of updated, effective influenza vaccines. Consequently, NIAViD, in conjunction with other resources, could be used to support surveillance efforts and inform the development of updated influenza vaccines.","253":"The 2014-2016 Ebola virus disease outbreak revealed the fragility of the Guinean public health infrastructure. As a result, the Guinean Ministry of Health is collaborating with international partners to improve compliance with the International Health Regulations and work toward the Global Health Security Agenda goals, including enhanced case- and community-based disease surveillance. We assessed the case-based disease surveillance system during October 1, 2015-March 31, 2016, in the Boffa prefecture of Guinea. We conducted onsite interviews with public health staff at the peripheral (health center), middle (prefectural), and central (Ministry of Health) levels of the public health system to document leadership structure; methods for maintaining case registers and submitting weekly case reports; disease surveillance feedback; data analysis; and baseline surveillance information on four epidemic-prone diseases (cholera, meningococcal meningitis, measles, and yellow fever). The surveillance system was simple and paper-based at health centers and computer spreadsheet-based at the prefectural and central levels. Surveillance feedback to stakeholders at all levels was infrequent. Data analysis activities were minimal at the peripheral levels and progressively more robust at the prefectural and central levels. Reviewing the surveillance reports from Boffa during the study period, we observed zero reported cases of the four epidemic-prone diseases in the weekly reporting from the peripheral to the central level. Similarly, the national District Health Information System 2 had no reported cases of the four diseases in Boffa but did indicate reported cases among all four neighboring prefectures. Based on the assessment findings, which suggest low sensitivity of the case-based disease surveillance system in Boffa, we recommend additional training and support to improve surveillance data quality and enhance Guinean public health workforce capacity to use these data.","254":"The tumor ecosystem with heterogeneous cellular compositions and the tumor microenvironment has increasingly become the focus of cancer research in recent years. The extracellular matrix (ECM), the major component of the tumor microenvironment, and its interactions with the tumor cells and stromal cells have also enjoyed tremendously increased attention. Like the other components of the tumor microenvironment, the ECM in solid tumors differs significantly from that in normal organs and tissues. We review recent studies of the complex roles the tumor ECM plays in cancer progression, from tumor initiation, growth to angiogenesis and invasion. We highlight that the biomolecular, biophysical, and mechanochemical interactions between the ECM and cells not only regulate the steps of cancer progression, but also affect the efficacy of systemic cancer treatment. We further discuss the strategies to target and modify the tumor ECM to improve cancer therapy.","255":"The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has the potential to cause serious disease that can spread rapidly around the world. Much of our understanding of SARS-CoV pathogenesis comes from in vitro experiments. Unfortunately, in vitro experiments cannot replicate all the complexity of the in vivo infection. For example, proteases in the respiratory tract cleave the SARS-CoV surface protein to facilitate viral entry, but these proteases are not present in vitro. Unfortunately, proteases might also have an effect on other parts of the replication cycle. Here, we use mathematical modeling to estimate parameters characterizing viral replication for SARS-CoV in the presence of trypsin or elastase, and in the absence of either. In addition to increasing the infection rate, the addition of trypsin and elastase causes lengthening of the eclipse phase duration and the infectious cell lifespan.","256":"With the prompt administration of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines, highly vaccinated countries have begun to lift their stringent control measures. However, considering the spread of highly transmissible new variants, resuming socio-economic activities may lead to the resurgence of incidence, particularly in nations with a low proportion of individuals who have natural immunity. Here, we aimed to quantitatively assess an optimal COVID-19 exit strategy in the Republic of Korea, where only a small number of cumulative incidences have been recorded\u00a0as of September 2021, comparing epidemiological outcomes via scenario analysis.Our model-based projections provide evidence-based guidance for an exit strategy that allows society to resume normal life while sustaining the suppression of the COVID-19 epidemic in countries where the spread of COVID-19 has been well controlled.Our projection suggests that tapering the level of social distancing countermeasures to the minimum level from November 2021 can efficiently suppress a resurgence of incidence given the currently planned nationwide vaccine roll-out. In addition, considering the spread of the Delta variant, our model suggested that gradual easing of countermeasures for more than 4\u2009months can efficiently withstand the prevalence of severe COVID-19 cases until the end of 2022.A discrete-time deterministic compartmental model structured by age group was used, accounting for the variant-specific transmission dynamics and the currently planned nationwide vaccination. All parameters were calibrated using comprehensive empirical data obtained from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency.","257":") and % of breaths with flow limitation, and hypoxia by 'hypoxic burden'. Primary outcomes were medication-adjusted systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). We used generalised linear models adjusted for age, sex, race\/ethnicity, smoking, education, body mass index, alcohol use, periodic limb movements and alternative physiological disturbances.Higher duty cycle was associated with lower SBP overall and hypoxic burden with higher SBP and DBP among non-BP medication users. These findings suggest changes in both respiratory effort and oxygenation during sleep influence BP.Mechanisms underlying blood pressure (BP) changes in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) are incompletely understood. We assessed the associations between BP and selected polysomnography (PSG) traits: sleep depth, airflow limitation measurements and OSA-specific hypoxic burden.The sample had a mean age of 68.4 years and apnoea-hypopnoea index of 14.8 events\/hour. Sleep depth was not significantly associated with BP. Every 1 SD increment in log-transformed non-rapid eye movement duty cycle was associated with 0.9% decrease in SBP (95%\u2009CI: 0.1% to 1.6%), even after adjusting for sleep depth and hypoxic burden. Every 1 SD increment in log-transformed hypoxic burden was associated with a 1.1% increase in SBP (95%\u2009CI: 0.1% to 2.1%) and 1.9% increase in DBP (95%\u2009CI: 1.0% to 2.8%) among those not using hypertension medications.","258":"The basic reproductive number (R0) and superspreading potential (k) are key epidemiological parameters that inform our understanding of a disease's transmission. Often these values are estimated using the data obtained from contact tracing studies. Here we performed a simulation study to understand how incomplete data due to preferential contact tracing impacted the accuracy and inferences about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Our results indicate that as the number of positive contacts traced decreases, our estimates of R0 tend to decrease and our estimates of ktend to increase. Notably, when there are large amounts of positive contacts missed in the tracing process, we can conclude that there is no indication of superspreading even if we know there is. The results of this study highlight the need for a unified public health response to transmissible diseases.","259":"We report the rationale and design of a planned pragmatic, cluster randomized, double-blinded trial (N\u00a0=\u00a02700 in total nationwide), with 1500 newly diagnosed individuals with COVID-19 infection, together with up to one close household contact each (~1200 contacts), randomized to either vitamin D3 (loading dose, then 3200\u00a0IU\/day) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio and a household cluster design. The study duration is 4\u00a0weeks. The primary outcome for newly diagnosed individuals is the occurrence of hospitalization and\/or mortality. Key secondary outcomes include symptom severity scores among cases and changes in the infection (seroconversion) status for their close household contacts. Changes in vitamin D 25(OH)D levels will be assessed and their relation to study outcomes will be explored.The proposed pragmatic trial will allow parallel testing of vitamin D3 supplementation for early treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19. The household cluster design provides a cost-efficient approach to testing an intervention for reducing rates of hospitalization and\/or mortality in newly diagnosed cases and preventing infection among their close household contacts.To determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on disease progression and post-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19 infection. We hypothesize that high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation will reduce risk of hospitalization\/death among those with recently diagnosed COVID-19 infection and will reduce risk of COVID-19 infection among their close household contacts.","260":"Network analysis provides a powerful tool to analyze complex influences of social and ecological structures on community and household dynamics. Most network studies of social-ecological systems use simple, undirected, unweighted networks. We analyze multiplex, directed, and weighted networks of subsistence food flows collected in three small indigenous communities in Arctic Alaska potentially facing substantial economic and ecological changes. Our analysis of plausible future scenarios suggests that changes to social relations and key households have greater effects on community robustness than changes to specific wild food resources.","261":"Dengue is expanding globally, but how dengue emergence is shaped locally by interactions between climatic and socio-environmental factors is not well understood. Here, we investigate the drivers of dengue incidence and emergence in Vietnam, through analysing 23 years of district-level case data spanning a period of significant socioeconomic change (1998-2020). We show that urban infrastructure factors (sanitation, water supply, long-term urban growth) predict local spatial patterns of dengue incidence, while human mobility is a more influential driver in subtropical northern regions than the endemic south. Temperature is the dominant factor shaping dengue's distribution and dynamics, and using long-term reanalysis temperature data we show that warming since 1950 has expanded transmission risk throughout Vietnam, and most strongly in current dengue emergence hotspots (e.g., southern central regions, Ha Noi). In contrast, effects of hydrometeorology are complex, multi-scalar and dependent on local context: risk increases under either short-term precipitation excess or long-term drought, but improvements in water supply mitigate drought-associated risks except under extreme conditions. Our findings challenge the assumption that dengue is an urban disease, instead suggesting that incidence peaks in transitional landscapes with intermediate infrastructure provision, and provide evidence that interactions between recent climate change and mobility are contributing to dengue's expansion throughout Vietnam.","262":"In total, 1171 unique participants in 303 households were monitored for ARI. Of participating households, 128 (42%) included a child aged <5 years and 202 (67%) included a child aged 5-12 years. Of the 678 swabs collected during the surveillance period, 237 (35%) tested positive for one or more non-influenza respiratory viruses. Rhinovirus, common human coronaviruses, and respiratory syncytial virus were the most common. Four cases of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in three households.From November 2019 to April 2020, 303 households in the Seattle area were remotely monitored in a prospective longitudinal study for symptoms of respiratory viral illness. Enrolled participants reported weekly symptoms and submitted respiratory samples by mail in the event of an acute respiratory illness (ARI). Specimens were tested for fourteen viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, using RT-PCR. Participants completed all study procedures at home without physical contact with research staff.This study highlights the circulation of respiratory viruses within households during the winter months during the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Contactless methods of recruitment, enrollment and sample collection were utilized throughout this study, and demonstrate the feasibility of home-based, remote monitoring for respiratory infections.Non-influenza respiratory viruses are responsible for a substantial burden of disease in the United States. Household transmission is thought to contribute significantly to subsequent transmission through the broader community. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, contactless surveillance methods are of particular importance.","263":"2298 medical professionals were included in this study.Improving operative proficiency in electronic devices, accommodating to work schedules, increasing familiarity with e-hospitals and regulating practices will improve the readiness of healthcare providers to work at e-hospitals.Information was collected from healthcare providers who have more than 3 years of work experience from a tertiary hospital, secondary hospital, PHCs and private hospital.Overall, 86.3% had a positive response towards working at e-hospitals. Age (p<0.05), familiarity with e-hospitals (p<0.001) and prior work practices in online healthcare settings (p<0.001) were associated with participants' readiness to work at e-hospitals. Gender, education level, professional level, the tier of their affiliated hospital and workload were not statistically associated. Healthcare providers who had positive attitudes towards e-hospitals considered improved efficiency, patient satisfaction, communication among physicians, increased reputation and income, and alleviated workload to be advantages of adoption. The participants who were unwilling to work at e-hospitals perceived lack of time, insufficient authenticity\/reliability and underdeveloped policies as potential barriers.A cross-sectional study conducted in Sichuan, China, between June and September 2019.This study included a self-administered questionnaire that was used to assess participants' sociodemographic characteristics, online medical practices, willingness to use e-hospitals and perceived facilitators\/barriers to working at e-hospitals. Multivariate regression analysis was performed in order to evaluate the independent factors associated with e-hospital work.The growth and development of smartphones and eHealth technologies have enabled the potential for extended care hospitals (e-hospitals) in China in order to facilitate the success of a primary healthcare centre (PHC)-based integrated delivery model. Although the adoption of e-hospitals is essential, few studies have directed their research towards understanding the perspectives of healthcare providers. This study aims to identify the current readiness of healthcare providers to adopt e-hospital technologies, determine the factors influencing this adoption and describe the perceived facilitators and barriers in regard to working at e-hospitals.","264":"Eye-tracking is a valuable research tool that is used in laboratory and limited field environments. We take steps toward developing methods that enable widespread adoption of eye-tracking and its real-time application in clinical decision support. Eye-tracking will enhance awareness and enable intelligent views, more precise alerts, and other forms of decision support in the Electronic Medical Record (EMR). We evaluated a low-cost eye-tracking device and found the device's accuracy to be non-inferior to a more expensive device. We also developed and evaluated an automatic method for mapping eye-tracking data to interface elements in the EMR (e.g., a displayed laboratory test value). Mapping was 88% accurate across the six participants in our experiment. Finally, we piloted the use of the low-cost device and the automatic mapping method to label training data for a Learning EMR (LEMR) which is a system that highlights the EMR elements a physician is predicted to use.","265":"Lymphoid tissue is a key reservoir established by HIV-1 during acute infection. It is a site associated with viral production, storage of viral particles in immune complexes, and viral persistence. Although combinations of antiretroviral drugs usually suppress viral replication and reduce viral RNA to undetectable levels in blood, it is unclear whether treatment fully suppresses viral replication in lymphoid tissue reservoirs. Here we show that virus evolution and trafficking between tissue compartments continues in patients with undetectable levels of virus in their bloodstream. We present a spatial and dynamic model of persistent viral replication and spread that indicates why the development of drug resistance is not a foregone conclusion under conditions in which drug concentrations are insufficient to completely block virus replication. These data provide new insights into the evolutionary and infection dynamics of the virus population within the host, revealing that HIV-1 can continue to replicate and replenish the viral reservoir despite potent antiretroviral therapy. ","266":"Allosensitized children listed with a requirement for a negative prospective crossmatch have high mortality. Previously, we found that listing with the intent to accept the first suitable organ offer, regardless of the possibility of a positive crossmatch (TAKE strategy), results in a survival advantage from the time of listing compared to awaiting transplantation across a negative crossmatch (WAIT). The cost-effectiveness of these strategies is unknown. We used Markov modeling to compare cost-effectiveness between these waitlist strategies for allosensitized children listed urgently for heart transplantation. We used registry data to estimate costs and waitlist\/posttransplant outcomes. We assumed patients remained in hospital after listing, no positive crossmatches for WAIT, and a base-case probability of a positive crossmatch of 47% for TAKE. Accepting the first suitable organ offer cost less ($405\u2009904 vs. $534\u2009035) and gained more quality-adjusted life years (3.71 vs. 2.79). In sensitivity analyses, including substitution of waitlist data from children with unacceptable antigens specified during listing, TAKE remained cost-saving or cost-effective. Our findings suggest acceptance of the first suitable organ offer for urgently listed allosensitized pediatric heart transplant candidates is cost-effective and transplantation should not be denied because of allosensitization status alone. ","267":"During various stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries implemented diverse vaccine management approaches, influenced by variations in infrastructure and socio-economic conditions. This article provides a comprehensive overview of optimization models developed by the research community throughout the COVID-19 era, aimed at enhancing vaccine distribution and establishing a standardized framework for future pandemic preparedness. These models address critical issues such as site selection, inventory management, allocation strategies, distribution logistics, and route optimization encountered during the COVID-19 crisis. A unified framework is employed to describe the models, emphasizing their integration with epidemiological models to facilitate a holistic understanding. This article also summarizes evolving nature of literature, relevant research gaps, and authors' perspectives for model selection. Finally, future research scopes are detailed both in the context of modeling and solutions approaches.","268":"To quantify lessons learned to better prepare for similar pandemic crisis in the future, we assess the overall impact of social distancing on the daily growth rate of COVID-19 infections in the U.S. during the initial phase of the pandemic and the impacts' heterogeneity by urbanity and social vulnerability of the counties. The initial phase is chosen to purposely identify the essential and largest impact of the first-line of defense measure for similar pandemic: social distancing.Besides the substantial curve flattening effects of social distancing, our results show significant spillover effects induced by neighboring counties' social distancing levels even in the absence of significant within-county effects. Urban and areas with high social vulnerability are the ones benefit the most from social distancing and high level of compliance is needed. Moderate level is enough in reaching the peak marginal impact in rural and areas with low social vulnerability.Spatial Durbin models with county fixed effects were used to account for spatial dependencies and identify spatial spillover effects and spatial heterogeneity.","269":"Our objective is to bring together a variety of disease-related data and analytics needed to help public health analysts answer the following 3 primary questions for detecting and understanding disease re-emergence: Is there a potential disease re-emergence at the local (country) level? What are the potential contributing factors for this re-emergence? Is there a potential for global re-emergence?We collected and cleaned disease-related data (eg, case counts, vaccination rates, and indicators related to disease transmission) from several data sources including the World Health Organization (WHO), Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), World Bank, and Gideon. We combined these data with machine learning and visual analytics into a tool called RED Alert to detect re-emergence for the following 4 diseases: measles, cholera, dengue, and yellow fever. We evaluated the performance of the machine learning models for re-emergence detection and reviewed the output of the tool through a number of case studies.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tool that focuses specifically on disease re-emergence and addresses the important challenges mentioned above.Our supervised learning models were able to identify 82%-90% of the local re-emergence events, although with 18%-31% (except 46% for dengue) false positives. This is consistent with our goal of identifying all possible re-emergences while allowing some false positives. The review of the web-based tool through case studies showed that local re-emergence detection was possible and that the tool provided actionable information about potential factors contributing to the local disease re-emergence and trends in global disease re-emergence.Currently, the identification of infectious disease re-emergence is performed without describing specific quantitative criteria that can be used to identify re-emergence events consistently. This practice may lead to ineffective mitigation. In addition, identification of factors contributing to local disease re-emergence and assessment of global disease re-emergence require access to data about disease incidence and a large number of factors at the local level for the entire world. This paper presents Re-emerging Disease Alert (RED Alert), a web-based tool designed to help public health officials detect and understand infectious disease re-emergence.","270":"An outbreak of over 1,000 COVID-19 cases in Provincetown, Massachusetts (MA), in July 2021-the first large outbreak mostly in vaccinated individuals in the US-prompted a comprehensive public health response, motivating changes to national masking recommendations and raising questions about infection and transmission among vaccinated individuals. To address these questions, we combined viral genomic and epidemiological data from 467 individuals, including 40% of outbreak-associated cases. The Delta variant accounted for 99% of cases in this dataset; it was introduced from at least 40 sources, but 83% of cases derived from a single source, likely through transmission across multiple settings over a short time rather than a single event. Genomic and epidemiological data supported multiple transmissions of Delta from and between fully vaccinated individuals. However, despite its magnitude, the outbreak had limited onward impact in MA and the US overall, likely due to high vaccination rates and a robust public health response.","271":"Disruptions in routine immunizations due to the COVID-19 pandemic have been a cause of significant concern for health organizations worldwide. This research develops a system science approach to examine the potential risk of geographical clustering of underimmunized individuals for an infectious disease like measles. We use an activity-based population network model and school immunization records to identify underimmunized clusters of zip codes in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Although Virginia has high vaccine coverage at the state level for measles, finer-scale investigation at the zip code level finds three statistically significant underimmunized clusters. To estimate the criticality of these clusters, a stochastic agent-based network epidemic model is used. Results show that different clusters can cause vastly different outbreaks in the region, depending on their size, location, and network characteristics. This research aims to understand why some underimmunized geographical clusters do not cause a large outbreak while others do. A detailed network analysis shows that it is not the average degree of the cluster or the percentage of underimmunized individuals in the cluster but the average eigenvector centrality of the cluster that is important in determining its potential risk.","272":"A large-scale public health emergency, such as a severe influenza pandemic, can generate large numbers of critically ill patients in a short time. We modeled the number of mechanical ventilators that could be used in addition to the number of hospital-based ventilators currently in use.We identified key components of the health care system needed to deliver ventilation therapy, quantified the maximum number of additional ventilators that each key component could support at various capacity levels (ie, conventional, contingency, and crisis), and determined the constraining key component at each capacity level.The current US health care system may have limited capacity to use additional mechanical ventilators during a large-scale public health emergency. Emergency planners need to understand their health care systems' capability to absorb additional resources and expand care. This methodology could be adapted by emergency planners to determine stockpiling goals for critical resources or to identify alternatives to manage overwhelming critical care need.Our study results showed that US hospitals could absorb between 26,200 and 56,300 additional ventilators at the peak of a national influenza pandemic outbreak with robust pre-pandemic planning.","273":"We explore the spatial and temporal spread of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus under containment measures in three European countries based on fits to data of the early outbreak. Using data from Spain and Italy, we estimate an age dependent infection fatality ratio for SARS-CoV-2, as well as risks of hospitalization and intensive care admission. We use them in a model that simulates the dynamics of the virus using an age structured, spatially detailed agent based approach, that explicitly incorporates governmental interventions and changes in mobility and contact patterns occurred during the COVID-19 outbreak in each country. Our simulations reproduce several of the features of its spatio-temporal spread in the three countries studied. They show that containment measures combined with high density are responsible for the containment of cases within densely populated areas, and that spread to less densely populated areas occurred during the late stages of the first wave. The capability to reproduce observed features of the spatio-temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 makes this model a potential candidate for forecasting the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in other settings, and we recommend its application in low and lower-middle income countries which remain understudied.","274":"The recently emerged coronavirus in Wuhan, China has claimed at least two lives as of January 17 and infected hundreds if not thousands of individuals. The situation has drawn international attention, including from the virology community. We applaud the rapid release to the public of the genome sequence of the new virus by Chinese virologists, but we also believe that increased transparency on disease reporting and data sharing with international colleagues are crucial for curbing the spread of this newly emerging virus to other parts of the world.","275":"What drives the emergence of new species has fascinated biologists since Darwin. Reproductive barriers to gene flow are a key step in the formation of species, and recent advances have shed new light on how these are established. Genetic, genomic, and comparative techniques, together with improved theoretical frameworks, are increasing our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. They are also helping us forecast speciation and reveal the impact of human activity.","276":"Modeling studies of household transmission data have helped characterize the role of children in influenza and COVID-19 epidemics. However, estimates from these studies may be biased since they do not account for the heterogeneous nature of household contacts. Here, we quantified the impact of contact heterogeneity between household members on the estimation of child relative susceptibility and infectivity. We simulated epidemics of SARS-CoV-2-like and influenza-like infections in a synthetic population of 1,000 households assuming heterogeneous contact levels. Relative contact frequencies were derived from a household contact study according to which contacts are more frequent in the father-mother pair, followed by the child-mother, child-child, and finally child-father pairs. Child susceptibility and infectivity were then estimated while accounting for heterogeneous contacts or not. When ignoring contact heterogeneity, child relative susceptibility was underestimated by approximately 20% in the two disease scenarios. Child relative infectivity was underestimated by 20% when children and adults had different infectivity levels. These results are sensitive to our assumptions of European-style household contact patterns; but they highlight that household studies collecting both disease and contact data are needed to assess the role of complex household contact behavior on disease transmission and improve estimation of key biological parameters.","277":"Respiratory viruses cause acute respiratory diseases with a broad and overlapping spectrum of symptoms. We examined the clinical symptoms and explored the patterns of various respiratory viral infections in children in Hong Kong. Among 2090 specimens collected from outpatient care (2007-2010), 1343 (64.3%) were positive for any virus by the xTAG assay, and 81 (3.9%) were positive for co-infection. The most frequently detected viruses among children aged 6-15 years were enterovirus\/rhinovirus and influenza virus A, whereas most non-influenza viruses were more frequently detected in younger children. Higher body temperature was more common for illnesses associated with influenza viruses than for those associated with non-influenza viruses, but other symptoms were largely similar across all infections. The seasonality pattern varied among different viruses, with influenza virus A being the predominant virus detected in winter, and enterovirus\/rhinovirus being more commonly detected than influenza virus A in the other three seasons, except for 2009.","278":"Our model is able to successfully describe the initial wave of COVID-19 in Belgium and identifies interactions during leisure\/other activities as pivotal in the exit strategy. Indeed, we find a smaller impact of school re-openings as compared to restarting leisure activities and re-openings of work places. We also assess the impact of case isolation of new (suspected) infections, and find that it allows re-establishing relatively more social interactions while still ensuring epidemic control. Scenarios predicting a second wave of hospitalizations were not observed, suggesting that the per-contact probability of infection has changed with respect to the pre-lockdown period.Contacts during leisure activities are found to be most influential, followed by professional contacts and school contacts, respectively, for an impending second wave of COVID-19. Regular re-assessment of social contacts in the population is therefore crucial to adjust to evolving behavioral changes that can affect epidemic diffusion.We analysed the expected impact of relaxing stringent lockdown measures taken according to the phased Belgian exit strategy. We developed a stochastic, data-informed, meta-population model that accounts for mixing and mobility of the age-structured population of Belgium. The model is calibrated to daily hospitalization data and is able to reproduce the outbreak at the national level. We consider different scenarios for relieving the lockdown, quantified in terms of relative reductions in pre-pandemic social mixing and mobility. We validate our assumptions by making comparisons with social contact data collected during and after the lockdown.In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, several countries adopted measures of social distancing to a different degree. For many countries, after successfully curbing the initial wave, lockdown measures were gradually lifted. In Belgium, such relief started on May 4th with phase 1, followed by several subsequent phases over the next few weeks.","279":"Countries such as South Africa have limited intensive care unit (ICU) capacity to handle the expected number of COVID-19 patients requiring ICU care. Remdesivir can prevent deaths in countries such as South Africa by decreasing the number of days people spend in ICU, therefore freeing up ICU bed capacity.","280":"Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), which began as a small outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019, became a global pandemic within months due to its high transmissibility. In the absence of pharmaceutical treatment, various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to contain the spread of COVID-19 brought the entire world to a halt. After almost a year of seemingly returning to normalcy with the world\u2019s quickest vaccine development, the emergence of more infectious and vaccine resistant coronavirus variants is bringing the situation back to where it was a year ago. In the light of this new situation, we conducted a study to portray the possible scenarios based on the three key factors : impact of interventions (pharmaceutical and NPIs), vaccination rate, and vaccine efficacy. In our study, we assessed two of the most crucial factors, transmissibility and vaccination rate, in order to reduce the spreading of COVID-19 in a simple but effective manner. In order to incorporate the time-varying mutational landscape of COVID-19 variants, we estimated a weighted transmissibility composed of the proportion of existing strains that naturally vary over time. Additionally, we consider time varying vaccination rates based on the number of daily new cases. Our method for calculating the vaccination rate from past active cases is an effective approach in forecasting probable future scenarios as it actively tracks people\u2019s attitudes toward immunization as active cases change. Our simulations show that if a large number of individuals cannot be vaccinated in a short period of time, adopting NPIs is the best approach to manage disease transmission with the emergence of new vaccine breakthrough variants and more infectious variants.","281":"The surveillance of influenza activity is critical to early detection of epidemics and pandemics and the design of disease control strategies. Case reporting through a voluntary network of sentinel physicians is a commonly used method of passive surveillance for monitoring rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) worldwide. Despite its ubiquity, little attention has been given to the processes underlying the observation, collection, and spatial aggregation of sentinel surveillance data, and its subsequent effects on epidemiological understanding. We harnessed the high specificity of diagnosis codes in medical claims from a database that represented 2.5 billion visits from upwards of 120,000 United States healthcare providers each year. Among influenza seasons from 2002-2009 and the 2009 pandemic, we simulated limitations of sentinel surveillance systems such as low coverage and coarse spatial resolution, and performed Bayesian inference to probe the robustness of ecological inference and spatial prediction of disease burden. Our models suggest that a number of socio-environmental factors, in addition to local population interactions, state-specific health policies, as well as sampling effort may be responsible for the spatial patterns in U.S. sentinel ILI surveillance. In addition, we find that biases related to spatial aggregation were accentuated among areas with more heterogeneous disease risk, and sentinel systems designed with fixed reporting locations across seasons provided robust inference and prediction. With the growing availability of health-associated big data worldwide, our results suggest mechanisms for optimizing digital data streams to complement traditional surveillance in developed settings and enhance surveillance opportunities in developing countries.","282":"Although many parasites are transmitted between hosts by a suite of arthropod vectors, the impact of vector biodiversity on parasite transmission is poorly understood. Positive relationships between host infection prevalence and vector species richness (SR) may operate through multiple mechanisms, including (i) increased vector abundance, (ii) a sampling effect in which species of high vectorial capacity are more likely to occur in species-rich communities, and (iii) functional diversity whereby communities comprised species with distinct phenologies may extend the duration of seasonal transmission. Teasing such mechanisms apart is impeded by a lack of appropriate data, yet could highlight a neglected role for functional diversity in parasite transmission. We used statistical modelling of extensive host, vector and microparasite data to test the hypothesis that functional diversity leading to longer seasonal transmission explained variable levels of disease in a wildlife population. We additionally developed a simple transmission model to guide our expectation of how an increased transmission season translates to infection prevalence. Our study demonstrates that vector SR is associated with increased levels of disease reporting, but not via increases in vector abundance or via a sampling effect. Rather, the relationship operates by extending the length of seasonal transmission, in line with theoretical predictions.","283":"These data add further evidence of rVSV-ZEBOV safety and immunogenicity, including in people with pre-existing antibodies from suspected natural ZEBOV infection whose state does not blunt rVSV-ZEBOV immune response. Pre-vaccination serological screening is not required.Zaire Ebolavirus disease (EVD) outbreaks can be controlled using rVSV-ZEBOV vaccination and other public health measures. People in high-risk areas may have pre-existing antibodies from asymptomatic Ebolavirus exposure that might affect response to rVSV-ZEBOV. Therefore, we assessed the impact pre-existing immunity had on post-vaccination IgG titre, virus neutralisation, and reactogenicity following vaccination.In this prospective cohort study, 2115 consenting close contacts (\"proches\") of EVD survivors were recruited. Proches were vaccinated with rVSV-ZEBOV and followed up for 28\u00a0days for safety and immunogenicity. Anti-GP IgG titre at baseline and day 28 was assessed by ELISA. Samples from a representative subset were evaluated using live virus neutralisation.Ten percent were seropositive at baseline. At day 28, IgG in baseline seronegative (GMT 0.106\u00a0IU\/ml, 95% CI: 0.100 to 0.113) and seropositive (GMT 0.237\u00a0IU\/ml, 0.210 to 0.267) participants significantly increased from baseline (both p\u2009<\u20090.0001). There was strong correlation between antibody titres and virus neutralisation in day 28 samples (Spearman's rho 0.75). Vaccinees with baseline IgG antibodies against Zaire Ebolavirus had similar safety profiles to those without detectable antibodies (63.6% vs 66.1% adults experienced any adverse event; 49.1% vs 60.9% in children), with almost all adverse events graded as mild. No serious adverse events were attributed to vaccination. No EVD survivors tested positive for Ebolavirus by RT-PCR.","284":"We estimated that 2.0 (95% credible interval 0.5-4.5) reported GBS cases may occur per 10,000 Zika virus infections. The frequency of reported suspect Zika cases varied substantially and was highly uncertain, with a mean of 0.11 (95% credible interval 0.01-0.24) suspect cases reported per infection.Countries with ongoing outbreaks of Zika virus have observed a notable rise in reported cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), with mounting evidence of a causal link between Zika virus infection and the neurological syndrome. However, the risk of GBS following a Zika virus infection is not well characterized. In this work, we used data from 11 locations with publicly available data to estimate the risk of GBS following an infection with Zika virus, as well as the location-specific incidence of infection and the number of suspect GBS cases reported per infection.We built a mathematical inference framework utilizing data from 11 locations that had reported suspect Zika and GBS cases, two with completed outbreaks prior to 2015 (French Polynesia and Yap) and nine others in the Americas covering partial outbreaks and where transmission was ongoing as of early 2017.These estimates can help efforts to prepare for the GBS cases that may occur during Zika epidemics and highlight the need to better understand the relationship between infection and the reported incidence of clinical disease.","285":" was attributable to meteorological factors. The fractions attributable to meteorological factors generally were higher in northern counties than in southern counties. Our findings indicate that cold and dry weather and low levels of ultraviolet radiation are moderately associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, with humidity playing the largest role.","286":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) primarily impacts infants and older adults, with seasonal winter outbreaks in temperate countries. Biennial cycles of RSV activity have also been identified in Northern Europe and some states in the United States. Delayed RSV activity was reported worldwide during the 2009 influenza pandemic, and a disrupted biennial pattern of RSV activity was observed in northern Stockholm following the pandemic. Biennial patterns shifted to early\/large outbreaks in even-numbered years and late\/small outbreaks in odd-numbered years. However, the mechanisms underpinning this change in pattern remain unknown. In this work, we constructed an age-stratified mechanistic model to explicitly test three factors that could lead to the change in RSV transmission dynamics: 1) birth rates, 2) temperatures, and 3) viral interference. By fitting the model to weekly RSV admission data over a 20-year period and comparing different models, we found that viral interference from influenza was the only mechanism that explained the shifted biennial pattern. Our work demonstrates the complex interplay between different respiratory viruses, providing evidence that supports the presence of interactions between the H1N1 pandemic influenza virus and RSV at the population level, with implications for future public health interventions.","287":"Predicting infectious disease dynamics is a central challenge in disease ecology. Models that can assess which individuals are most at risk of being exposed to a pathogen not only provide valuable insights into disease transmission and dynamics but can also guide management interventions. Constructing such models for wild animal populations, however, is particularly challenging; often only serological data are available on a subset of individuals and nonlinear relationships between variables are common. Here we provide a guide to the latest advances in statistical machine learning to construct pathogen-risk models that automatically incorporate complex nonlinear relationships with minimal statistical assumptions from ecological data with missing data. Our approach compares multiple machine learning algorithms in a unified environment to find the model with the best predictive performance and uses game theory to better interpret results. We apply this framework on two major pathogens that infect African lions: canine distemper virus (CDV) and feline parvovirus. Our modelling approach provided enhanced predictive performance compared to more traditional approaches, as well as new insights into disease risks in a wild population. We were able to efficiently capture and visualize strong nonlinear patterns, as well as model complex interactions between variables in shaping exposure risk from CDV and feline parvovirus. For example, we found that lions were more likely to be exposed to CDV at a young age but only in low rainfall years. When combined with our data calibration approach, our framework helped us to answer questions about risk of pathogen exposure that are difficult to address with previous methods. Our framework not only has the potential to aid in predicting disease risk in animal populations, but also can be used to build robust predictive models suitable for other ecological applications such as modelling species distribution or diversity patterns.","288":"The Upper Guinea Forest (UGF) region of West Africa is one of the most climatically marginal and human-impacted tropical forest regions in the world. Research on the patterns and drivers of vegetation change is critical for developing strategies to sustain ecosystem services in the region and to understand how climate and land use change will affect other tropical forests around the globe. We compared six spectral indices calculated from the 2001\u00962015 MODIS optical-infrared reflectance data with manually-interpreted measurements of woody vegetation cover from high resolution imagery. The tasseled cap wetness (TCW) index was found to have the strongest association with woody vegetation cover, whereas greenness indices, such as the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), had relatively weak associations with woody cover. Trends in woody vegetation cover measured with the TCW index were analyzed using Mann\u0096Kendall statistics and were contrasted with trends in vegetation greenness measured with EVI. In the drier West Sudanian Savanna and Guinean Forest-Savanna Mosaic ecoregions, EVI trends were primarily positive, and TCW trends were primarily negative, suggesting that woody vegetation cover was decreasing, while herbaceous vegetation cover is increasing. In the wettest tropical forests in the Western Guinean Lowland Forest ecoregion, declining trends in both TCW and EVI were indicative of widespread forest degradation resulting from human activities. Across all ecoregions, declines in woody cover were less prevalent in protected areas where human activities were restricted. Multiple lines of evidence suggested that human land use and resource extraction, rather than climate trends or short-term climatic anomalies, were the predominant drivers of recent vegetation change in the UGF region of West Africa.","289":" contact to mosquitoes and to adult humans. Scenario exploration indicates that personal-protection is a more effective control strategy than mosquito-reduction strategy. It also shows that delaying conception reduces the number of microcephaly cases, although this does little to prevent Zika transmission in the broader community. However, by coupling aggressive vector control and personal protection use, it is possible to reduce both microcephaly and Zika transmission. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classifications: 92B05, 93A30, 93C15.","290":"Effective public health measures must balance potentially conflicting demands from populations they serve. In the case of infectious disease risks from mosquito-borne infections, such as Zika virus, public concern about the pathogen may be counterbalanced by public concern about environmental contamination from chemical agents used for vector control. Here we introduce a generic framework for modeling how the spread of an infectious pathogen might lead to varying public perceptions, and therefore tolerance, of both disease risk and pesticide use. We consider how these dynamics might impact the spread of a vector-borne disease. We tailor and parameterize our model for direct application to Zika virus as spread by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, though the framework itself has broad applicability to any arboviral infection. We demonstrate how public risk perception of both disease and pesticides may drastically impact the spread of a mosquito-borne disease in a susceptible population. We conclude that models hoping to inform public health decision making about how best to mitigate arboviral disease risks should explicitly consider the potential public demand for, or rejection of, chemical control of mosquito populations.","291":"We analyses the relationship between landscape and environmental variables estimated from high-resolution satellite images with the temporal variation of the abundance of Lutzomyia longipalpis and Migonemyia migonei, vectors of leishmaniasis, in Corrientes city. At 8 collection sites, 14 samples were conducted between March 2012 to February 2014. Proportion of land cover classes derived from high resolution satellite images as: water, bare soil, urban areas, low vegetation and high vegetation, as well as average, maximum and minimum values of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Normalized Difference Water Index) in buffer areas of 50\u00a0m, 100\u00a0m and 150\u00a0m were used to characterize and identify suitable environmental conditions for the development of sand flies through Generalized Linear Mixed Models. The most frequently collected species during the sampling period was Lu. longipalpis and followed by Mg. migonei. The models showed that high Lu. longipalpis abundance were related to low proportion of high vegetation coverage, while a negative association was among Mg. migonei abundance and with values of Normalized Difference Water Index and with the interaction between urban areas and minimum values of Normalized Difference Water Index, and a positive association with the interaction between low vegetation and average values of Normalized Difference Water Index.","292":"The quality of antibiotic consumption in the community can be assessed using 12 drug-specific quality indicators (DSQIs) developed by the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption (ESAC) project. We compared quality in 2009 and 2017 in the EU\/European Economic Area (EEA) and evaluated the impact of using different DDD values (ATC\/DDD indices 2011 and 2019) for the 2009 quality assessment using these DSQIs and a joint scientific opinion (JSO) indicator.The quality of antibiotic consumption in the community as measured by the DSQIs further decreased between 2009 and 2017, especially in Southern and Eastern European countries. A continuous effort to improve antibiotic consumption is essential to reduce antibiotic consumption in general and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in particular.We calculated the 12 DSQIs and the JSO indicator for 2017 and for 2009 for EU\/EEA countries able to deliver values. For each of the indicators we grouped the 2017 and 2009 indicator values into four quartiles. To evaluate changes in quality between 2009 and 2017, we used the quartile distribution of the 2009 indicator values in 30 EU\/EEA countries as benchmarks. In addition, we compared the quality assessment for 2009 using the ATC\/DDD indices 2011 and 2019.In 2017, a difference in the quality of antibiotic consumption in the community between northern and southern EU\/EEA countries remained, but also several eastern EU\/EEA countries shifted towards lower quality. Quality of antibiotic consumption decreased between 2009 and 2017 in particular indicator values for penicillin, quinolone, relative \u03b2-lactam and broad- versus narrow-spectrum antibiotic consumption, and seasonal variation. Using different ATC\/DDD indices did not substantially change countries' ranking based on their DSQI values.","293":"Among 1,370 participants, adjusted cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was 16.1% (95% credible interval (CrI): 13.5-19.2%) as of November 16, 2020. The reported fraction was 26.6% and IFR was 0.78%. Non-Hispanic Black (PR: 2.03, CI 1.0, 4.1) and Hispanic adults (PR: 1.98, CI 0.74, 5.31) were more likely than non-Hispanic White adults to be seropositive.From August to December 2020, we mailed specimen collection kits (nasal swabs and blood spots) to a random sample of Georgia addresses. One household adult completed a survey and returned specimens for virus and antibody testing. We estimated cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections adjusted for waning antibodies, reported fraction, and infection fatality ratio (IFR). Differences in seropositivity among demographic, geographic and clinical subgroups were explored with weighted prevalence ratios (PR).Reported COVID-19 cases underestimate true SARS-CoV-2 infections. Data on all infections, including asymptomatic infections, are needed to guide programs. To minimize biases in estimates from reported cases and seroprevalence surveys, we conducted a household-based probability survey in Georgia and estimated cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections adjusted for antibody waning.As of mid-November 2020, one in 6 adults in Georgia had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. The COVID-19 epidemic in Georgia is likely substantially underestimated by reported cases.","294":"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis and an increasing incidence, for which novel therapeutic strategies are urgently required. Since the immune system has been described to play a presumed role in the protection against MPM, characterization of its tumor immune microenvironment (TME) and immune checkpoints can identify new immunotherapeutic targets and their predictive and\/or prognostic value. To characterize the TME and the immune checkpoint expression profile, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections from 54 MPM patients (40 at time of diagnosis; 14 treated with chemotherapy). We stained for PD-1, PD-L1, TIM-3, LAG-3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, granzyme B, FoxP3 and CD68. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between the immunological parameters and survival, as well as response to chemotherapy. We found that TIM-3, PD-1 and PD-L1 were expressed on both immune and tumor cells. Strikingly, PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on tumor cells was only seen in unpretreated samples. No LAG-3 expression was observed. CD45RO expression in the stroma was an independent negative predictive factor for response on chemotherapy, while CD4 and TIM-3 expression in lymphoid aggregates were independent prognostic factors for better outcome. Our data propose TIM-3 as a promising new target in mesothelioma. Chemotherapy influences the expression of immune checkpoints and therefore further research on the best combination treatment schedule is required.","295":"Evolutionary biologists typically represent clines as spatial gradients in a univariate character (or a principal-component axis) whose mean changes as a function of location along a transect spanning an environmental gradient or ecotone. This univariate approach may obscure the multivariate nature of phenotypic evolution across a landscape. Clines might instead be plotted as a series of vectors in multidimensional morphospace, connecting sequential geographic sites. We present a model showing that clines may trace nonlinear paths that arc through morphospace rather than elongating along a single major trajectory. Arcing clines arise because different characters diverge at different rates or locations along a geographic transect. We empirically confirm that some clines arc through morphospace, using morphological data from threespine stickleback sampled along eight independent transects from lakes down their respective outlet streams. In all eight clines, successive vectors of lake-stream divergence fluctuate in direction and magnitude in trait space, rather than pointing along a single phenotypic axis. Most clines exhibit surprisingly irregular directions of divergence as one moves downstream, although a few clines exhibit more directional arcs through morphospace. Our results highlight the multivariate complexity of clines that cannot be captured with the traditional graphical framework. We discuss hypotheses regarding the causes, and implications, of such arcing multivariate clines.","296":"Each year in the United States, influenza causes illness in 9.2 to 35.6 million individuals and is responsible for 12,000 to 56,000 deaths. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tracks influenza activity through a national surveillance network. These data are only available after a delay of 1 to 2 weeks, and thus influenza epidemiologists and transmission modelers have explored the use of other data sources to produce more timely estimates and predictions of influenza activity. We evaluated whether data collected from a national commercial network of influenza diagnostic machines could produce valid estimates of the current burden and help to predict influenza trends in the United States. Quidel Corporation provided us with de-identified influenza test results transmitted in real-time from a national network of influenza test machines called the Influenza Test System (ITS). We used this ITS dataset to estimate and predict influenza-like illness (ILI) activity in the United States over the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 influenza seasons. First, we developed linear logistic models on national and regional geographic scales that accurately estimated two CDC influenza metrics: the proportion of influenza test results that are positive and the proportion of physician visits that are ILI-related. We then used our estimated ILI-related proportion of physician visits in transmission models to produce improved predictions of influenza trends in the United States at both the regional and national scale. These findings suggest that ITS can be leveraged to improve \"nowcasts\" and short-term forecasts of U.S. influenza activity.","297":"Quantitative analysis and mathematical models are useful tools in informing strategies to control or eliminate disease. Currently, there is an urgent need to develop these tools to inform policy to achieve the 2020 goals for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). In this paper we give an overview of a collection of novel model-based analyses which aim to address key questions on the dynamics of transmission and control of nine NTDs: Chagas disease, visceral leishmaniasis, human African trypanosomiasis, leprosy, soil-transmitted helminths, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis and trachoma. Several common themes resonate throughout these analyses, including: the importance of epidemiological setting on the success of interventions; targeting groups who are at highest risk of infection or re-infection; and reaching populations who are not accessing interventions and may act as a reservoir for infection,. The results also highlight the challenge of maintaining elimination 'as a public health problem' when true elimination is not reached. The models elucidate the factors that may be contributing most to persistence of disease and discuss the requirements for eventually achieving true elimination, if that is possible. Overall this collection presents new analyses to inform current control initiatives. These papers form a base from which further development of the models and more rigorous validation against a variety of datasets can help to give more detailed advice. At the moment, the models' predictions are being considered as the world prepares for a final push towards control or elimination of neglected tropical diseases by 2020. ","298":"We conducted a household transmission study of SARS-CoV-2 in Costa Rica, with SARS-CoV-2 index cases selected from a larger prospective cohort study and their household contacts were enrolled. A total of 719 household contacts of 304 household index cases were enrolled from November 21, 2020, through July 31, 2021. Blood specimens were collected from contacts within 30-60 days of index case diagnosis; and serum was tested for presence of spike and nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 prior infections among household contacts was defined based on the presence of both spike and nucleocapsid antibodies. We fitted a chain binomial model to the serologic data, to account for exogenous community infection risk and potential multi-generational transmissions within the household.Overall seroprevalence was 53% (95% confidence interval (CI) 48-58%) among household contacts. The estimated household secondary attack rate is 34% (95% CI 5-75%). Mask wearing by the index case is associated with the household transmission risk reduction by 67% (adjusted odds ratio\u2009=\u20090.33 with 95% CI: 0.09-0.75) and not sharing bedroom with the index case is associated with the risk reduction of household transmission by 78% (adjusted odds ratio\u2009=\u20090.22 with 95% CI 0.10-0.41). The estimated distribution of household secondary attack rates is highly heterogeneous across index cases, with 30% of index cases being the source for 80% of secondary cases.Modeling analysis suggests that behavioral factors are important drivers of the observed SARS-CoV-2 transmission heterogeneity within the household.Variability in household secondary attack rates and transmission risks factors of SARS-CoV-2 remain poorly understood.","299":"In a randomized controlled trial, we tested whether a structured, patient-centered phone call from a clinical officer after HIV testing improved linkage to\/re-engagement in HIV care. Among 130 HIV-positive persons, those randomized to the phone call were significantly more likely to link to care by 7 and 30 days (P = .04).","300":"Metapopulation models have been primarily explored in infectious disease epidemiology to study host subpopulation movements and between-host contact structures. They also have the potential to investigate environmental pathogen transferring. In this study, we demonstrate that metapopulation models serve as an ideal modeling framework to characterize and quantify pathogen transfer between environment and hosts. It therefore unifies host, pathogen, and environment, collectively known as the epidemiological triad, a fundamental concept in epidemiology. We develop a customizable and generalized pathogen-transferring model where pathogens dwell in and transferring (via contact) between environment and hosts. We analyze three specific case studies: pure pathogen transferring without pathogen demography, source-sink dynamics, and pathogen control via external disinfection. We demonstrate how pathogens circulate in the system between environment and hosts, as well as evaluate different controlling efforts for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). For pure pathogen transferring, system equilibria can be derived analytically to explicitly quantify long-term pathogen distribution in the system. For source-sink dynamics and pathogen control via disinfection, we demonstrate that complete eradication of pathogens can be achieved, but the rates of converging to system equilibria differ based on specific model parameterization. Direct host-host pathogen transferring and within-host dynamics can be future directions of this modeling framework by adding specific modules.","301":"\u2009=\u2009.033).

To illustrate our methodological work in application, we put them to use for interpreting networks constructed from the data collected over one year in an observational study in Buffalo and Erie counties in New York state during the 2016-2017 influenza season. Even with the limitations in the data size, our methods are able to reveal the global (city- and season-wide) patterns in the spread of influenza, taking into account population mobility and socio-economic factors.","303":"A real-world population-based longitudinal study, aimed at determining the magnitude and duration of immunity induced by different types of vaccines against COVID-19, started in 2021 by enrolling a cohort of 2,497 individuals at time of their first vaccination. The study cohort included both healthy adults aged \u226465 years and elderly subjects aged >65 years with two or more co-morbidities. Here, patterns of anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral and cell-mediated specific immune response, assessed on 1,182 remaining subjects, at 6 (T6) and 12 months (T12) after the first vaccine dose, are described. At T12 median anti-Spike IgG antibody levels were increased compared to T6. The determinants of increased anti-Spike IgG were the receipt of a third vaccine dose between T6 and T12 and being positive for anti-Nucleocapside IgG at T12, a marker of recent infection, while age had no significant effect. The capacity of T12 sera to neutralize in vitro the ancestral B strain and the Omicron BA.5 variant was assessed in a subgroup of vaccinated subjects. A correlation between anti-S IgG levels and sera neutralizing capacity was identified and higher neutralizing capacity was evident in healthy adults compared to frail elderly subjects and in those who were positive for anti-Nucleocapside IgG at T12. Remarkably, one third of T12 sera from anti-Nucleocapside IgG negative older individuals were unable to neutralize the BA.5 variant strain. Finally, the evaluation of T-cell mediated immunity showed that most analysed subjects, independently from age and comorbidity, displayed Spike-specific responses with a high degree of polyfunctionality, especially in the CD8 compartment. In conclusion, vaccinated subjects had high levels of circulating antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 12 months after the primary vaccination, which increased as compared to T6. The enhancing effect could be attributable to the administration of a third vaccine dose but also to the occurrence of breakthrough infection. Older individuals, especially those who were anti-Nucleocapside IgG negative, displayed an impaired capacity to neutralize the BA.5 variant strain. Spike specific T-cell responses, able to sustain immunity and maintain the ability to fight the infection, were present in most of older and younger subjects assayed at T12.","304":"Comparisons of the utility and accuracy of methods for measuring social interactions relevant to disease transmission are rare. To increase the evidence base supporting specific methods to measure social interaction, we compared data from self-reported contact surveys and wearable proximity sensors from a cohort of schoolchildren in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Although the number and type of contacts recorded by each participant differed between the two methods, we found good correspondence between the two methods in aggregate measures of age-specific interactions. Fewer, but longer, contacts were reported in surveys, relative to the generally short proximal interactions captured by wearable sensors. When adjusted for expectations of proportionate mixing, though, the two methods produced highly similar, assortative age-mixing matrices. These aggregate mixing matrices, when used in simulation, resulted in similar estimates of risk of infection by age. While proximity sensors and survey methods may not be interchangeable for capturing individual contacts, they can generate highly correlated data on age-specific mixing patterns relevant to the dynamics of respiratory virus transmission.","305":" human BBB model is developed using human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC\/D3) for the assessment of migration. We compare monocyte uptake of both polymeric and synthetic protein nanoparticles (SPNPs) of various sizes, as well as their effect on cell migration. SPNPs (human serum albumin\/HSA or human transferrin\/TF) are shown to promote increased monocyte-mediated transport across the BBB over polymeric nanoparticles. TF SPNPs (200 nm) associate readily, with an average uptake of 138 particles\/cell. Nanoparticle loading is shown to influence the migration of THP-1 monocytes. The migration of monocytes loaded with 200 nm TF and 200 nm HSA SPNPs was 2.3-fold and 2.1-fold higher than that of an untreated control. RNA-seq analysis after TF SPNP treatment suggests that the upregulation of several migration genes may be implicated in increased monocyte migration (ex. integrin subunits \u03b1 M and \u03b1 L). Integrin \u03b2 2 chain combines with either integrin subunit \u03b1 M chain or integrin subunit \u03b1 L chain to form macrophage antigen 1 and lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 integrins. Both products play a pivotal role in the transendothelial migration cascade. Our findings highlight the potential of SPNPs as drug and\/or gene delivery platforms for monocyte-mediated BBB transport, especially where conventional polymer nanoparticles are ineffective or otherwise not desirable.","306":"Past studies have shown a link between maternal condition or resource availability, and the resultant sex ratio of offspring in avian species, both wild and domesticated. This study utilized 200 male and 400 female chicks from a W-36 white leghorn parent stock and assessed the effects of three diets with different caloric and protein concentrations on the sex ratios of the Hy-Line W-36 laying hens. As expected, the development of both parent and filial generations was significantly affected by diet or egg composition, respectively. Sex ratio was not significantly different from an assumed population proportion of 0.50 across all experimental groups, but did approach significance among offspring of parents switched from \u201cHigh\u201d to \u201cControl\u201d diets at 17 weeks of age. Results suggest that continual availability of either high- or low-nutrient density feed resources does not predispose hens to bias the sex ratio of their offspring; however, a sudden change in diet, particularly to one of lower protein concentration, may influence such an effect. Further trials are needed to assess the efficacy of diet alteration prior to reproductive maturity as a means of sex allocation manipulation.","307":"The aim of this study was to assess mobility patterns among a sample of transgender women (n=14) in New York City via survey and Global Positioning System (GPS) monitoring. We found varying levels of concordance between the residential neighbourhood and each of the non-residential contexts: 64.3% considered the neighbourhood that they socialised in most often to be different from their residential neighbourhood. While participants' residences represented 10 zone improvement plan code tabulation areas (ZCTAs), GPS data were recorded in 124 of 263 ZCTAs (47.1%). Overall, 58.2% (n=373,262) were recorded in ZCTAs in the highest quartile of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence. The association between place, community HIV prevalence, mobility, and factors that increase the vulnerability of transgender women to HIV infection are worthy of future investigation in reducing the burden of the HIV epidemic in these communities.","308":"[This corrects the article on p. 1753 in vol. 8, PMID: 29033901.].","309":"Recent approaches to TB control have focused on identifying and treating active cases to halt further transmission. Patients with TB symptoms often delay to seek care, get appropriate diagnosis, and initiate effective treatment. These delays are partly influenced by whom the patients contact within their community network. We aimed to evaluate the community drivers of diagnostic delay in an urban setting in Uganda.Visits to health providers without access to appropriate diagnostic services accounted for 56% of contacts made by cohort members, and were significantly associated with community contact delay, as were symptoms common to other prevalent illnesses, such as bone and joint pain.In this study we analyze data from a retrospective cohort of 194\u2009TB patients in Kampala, Uganda. We characterized the patterns of contacts made by patients seeking care for TB symptoms. The main outcome of interest was total community contact delay, defined as the time patients spent seeking care before visiting a provider capable of diagnosing TB.Education programs aimed at primary care providers, as well as other community members, may benefit case identification, by informing them of rarer symptoms of TB, potential for co-infections of TB and other prevalent diseases, and the availability of diagnostic services.","310":"Social and decision-making deficits are often the first symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders. In recent years, economic games, together with computational models of strategic learning, have been increasingly applied to the characterization of individual differences in social behavior, as well as their changes across time due to disease progression, treatment, or other factors. At the same time, the high dimensionality of these data poses an important challenge to statistical estimation of these models, potentially limiting the adoption of such approaches in patients and special populations. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian implementation of a class of strategic learning models, experience-weighted attraction (EWA), that is widely used in behavioral game theory. Importantly, this approach provides a unified framework for capturing between- and within-participant variation, including changes associated with disease progression, comorbidity, and treatment status. We show using simulated data that our hierarchical Bayesian approach outperforms representative agent and individual-level estimation methods that are commonly used in extant literature, with respect to parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, using an empirical dataset, we demonstrate the value of our approach over competing methods with respect to balancing model fit and complexity. Consistent with the success of hierarchical Bayesian approaches in other areas of behavioral science, our hierarchical Bayesian EWA model represents a powerful and flexible tool to apply to a wide range of behavioral paradigms for studying the interplay between complex human behavior and biological factors.","311":"Size estimation is particularly important for populations whose members experience disproportionate health issues or pose elevated health risks to the ambient social structures in which they are embedded. Efforts to derive size estimates are often frustrated when the population is hidden or hard-to-reach in ways that preclude conventional survey strategies, as is the case when social stigma is associated with group membership or when group members are involved in illegal activities. This paper extends prior research on the problem of network population size estimation, building on established survey\/sampling methodologies commonly used with hard-to-reach groups. Three novel one-step, network-based population size estimators are presented, for use in the context of uniform random sampling, respondent-driven sampling, and when networks exhibit significant clustering effects. We give provably sufficient conditions for the consistency of these estimators in large configuration networks. Simulation experiments across a wide range of synthetic network topologies validate the performance of the estimators, which also perform well on a real-world location-based social networking data set with significant clustering. Finally, the proposed schemes are extended to allow them to be used in settings where participant anonymity is required. Systematic experiments show favorable tradeoffs between anonymity guarantees and estimator performance. Taken together, we demonstrate that reasonable population size estimates are derived from anonymous respondent driven samples of 250-750 individuals, within ambient populations of 5,000-40,000. The method thus represents a novel and cost-effective means for health planners and those agencies concerned with health and disease surveillance to estimate the size of hidden populations. We discuss limitations and future work in the concluding section.","312":" mosquitoes and maintained in the environment by avian hosts, the virus can spill over into humans and horses, sometimes causing severe neuroinvasive illness. Several modeling studies have evaluated drivers of WNV disease risk, but nearly all have done so at broad scales and have reported mixed results of the effects of common explanatory variables. As a result, fine-scale relationships with common explanatory variables, particularly climatic, socioeconomic, and human demographic, remain uncertain across varying spatial extents. Using an interdisciplinary approach and an ongoing 12-year study of the Chicago region, this study evaluated the factors explaining WNV disease risk at high spatiotemporal resolution, comparing the human WNV model and covariate performance across three increasing spatial extents: ultrafine, local, and county scales. Our results demonstrate that as spatial extent increased, model performance increased. In addition, only six of the 23 assessed covariates were included in best-fit models of at least two scales. These results suggest that the mechanisms driving WNV ecology are scale-dependent and covariate importance increases as extent decreases. These tools may be particularly helpful for public health, mosquito, and disease control personnel in predicting and preventing disease within local and fine-scale jurisdictions, before spillover occurs.","313":"). We grouped transcripts into gene modules and mapped regulatory loci for modules enriched with transcripts specific for \u03b1-cells, and another specific for \u03b4-cells. However, no single module enriched for \u03b2-cell-specific transcripts, suggesting heterogeneity of gene expression patterns within the \u03b2-cell population. A module enriched in transcripts associated with branched-chain amino acid metabolism was the most strongly correlated with physiological traits that reflect insulin resistance. Although the mice in this study were not overtly diabetic, the analysis of pancreatic islet gene expression under dietary-induced stress enabled us to identify correlated variation in groups of genes that are functionally linked to diabetes-associated physiological traits. Our analysis suggests an expected degree of concordance between diabetes-associated loci in the mouse and those found in human populations, and demonstrates how the mouse can provide evidence to support nominal associations found in human genome-wide association mapping.","314":"Experimental and computational studies have revealed that T-cell cross-reactivity is a widespread phenomenon that can either be advantageous or detrimental to the host. In particular, detrimental effects can occur whenever the clonal dominance of memory cells is not justified by their infection-clearing capacity. Using an agent-based model of the immune system, we recently predicted the \"memory anti-na\u00efve\" phenomenon, which occurs when the secondary challenge is similar but not identical to the primary stimulation. In this case, the pre-existing memory cells formed during the primary infection may be rapidly deployed in spite of their low affinity and can actually prevent a potentially higher affinity na\u00efve response from emerging, resulting in impaired viral clearance. This finding allowed us to propose a mechanistic explanation for the concept of \"antigenic sin\" originally described in the context of the humoral response. However, the fact that antigenic sin is a relatively rare occurrence suggests the existence of evolutionary mechanisms that can mitigate the effect of the memory anti-na\u00efve phenomenon. In this study we use computer modeling to further elucidate clonal dominance and the memory anti-na\u00efve phenomenon, and to investigate a possible mitigating factor called attrition. Attrition has been described in the experimental and computational literature as a combination of competition for space and apoptosis of lymphocytes via type-I interferon in the early stages of a viral infection. This study systematically explores the relationship between clonal dominance and the mechanism of attrition. Our results suggest that attrition can indeed mitigate the memory anti-na\u00efve effect by enabling the emergence of a diverse, higher affinity na\u00efve response against the secondary challenge. In conclusion, modeling attrition allows us to shed light on the nature of clonal interaction and dominance.","315":"Gut microbiota and the immune system interact to maintain tissue homeostasis, but whether this interaction is involved in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is unclear. Here we report that oral antibiotics given during active disease removed harmful bacteria from the gut microbiota and attenuated SLE-like disease in lupus-prone mice. Using MRL\/lpr mice, we showed that antibiotics given after disease onset ameliorated systemic autoimmunity and kidney histopathology. They decreased IL-17-producing cells and increased the level of circulating IL-10. In addition, antibiotics removed Lachnospiraceae and increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus spp., two groups of bacteria previously shown to be associated with deteriorated or improved symptoms in MRL\/lpr mice, respectively. Moreover, we showed that the attenuated disease phenotype could be recapitulated with a single antibiotic vancomycin, which reshaped the gut microbiota and changed microbial functional pathways in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, vancomycin treatment increased the barrier function of the intestinal epithelium, thus preventing the translocation of lipopolysaccharide, a cell wall component of Gram-negative Proteobacteria and known inducer of lupus in mice, into the circulation. These results suggest that mixed antibiotics or a single antibiotic vancomycin ameliorate SLE-like disease in MRL\/lpr mice by changing the composition of gut microbiota.","316":"Schistosomiasis, a chronic parasitic disease, remains a public health issue in tropical and subtropical regions, especially in low and moderate-income countries lacking assured access to safe water and proper sanitation. A national prevalence survey carried out by the Brazilian Ministry of Health from 2011 to 2015 found a decrease in human infection rates to 1%, with 19 out of 26 states still classified as endemic areas. There is a risk of schistosomiasis reemerging as a public health concern in low-endemic regions. This study proposes an integrated landscape-based approach to aid surveillance and control strategies for schistosomiasis in low-endemic areas.This study highlights the role of integrated landscape-based analyses in informing strategies for eliminating schistosomiasis. The methodology has produced new schistosomiasis risk maps covering the entire basin. The region's low endemicity can be partly explained by the limited connectivity among grouped landscape-units more prone to triggering schistosomiasis transmission. Nevertheless, changes in social, economic, and environmental landscapes, especially those linked to the rising pace of incomplete urbanization processes in the region, have the potential to increase risk of schistosomiasis transmission. This study will help target interventions to bring the region closer to schistosomiasis elimination.In the Middle Paranapanema river basin, specific landscapes linked to schistosomiasis were identified using a comprehensive methodology. This approach merged remote sensing, environmental, socioeconomic, epidemiological, and malacological data. A team of experts identified ten distinct landscape categories associated with varying levels of schistosomiasis transmission potential. These categories were used to train a supervised classification machine learning algorithm, resulting in a 92.5% overall accuracy and a 6.5% classification error. Evaluation revealed that 74.6% of collected snails from water collections in five key municipalities within the basin belonged to landscape types with higher potential for S. mansoni infection. Landscape connectivity metrics were also analysed.","317":"Human infection with avian influenza virus A(H7N9) remains a big threat and has a great potential to cause a pandemic in the foreseeable future. Antiviral treatment using the neuraminidase inhibitors has been recommended to treat H7N9 patients as early as possible, while evidence-based research on its effectiveness for the specific H7N9 infection was lacking.. We did not find an association between neuraminidase inhibitors treatment and survival benefit in H7N9 patients across various adjusted models and sensitivity analyses of missing data imputations.The result of our final model indicated that there is no significant association (Odds Ratio\u2009=\u20091.29, 95% Confidence Interval [0.78-2.15]) between time to neuraminidase inhibitors treatment and survivorship after controlling for both age and white cell count. Sensitivity analyses with multiple imputation for missing data concurred with the primary complete case analysis.We reviewed data from all laboratory-confirmed avian influenza A H7N9 cases in Zhejiang province between 2013 and 2017 and fit time-dependent survival models to evaluate the effectiveness of neuraminidase inhibitors treatment as an intervention to reduce death risk.","318":"To determine HCV testing proportion and factors associated with treatment initiation, and treatment outcomes in a large sample of FQHCs around the U.S.Of the 1,508,525 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 88,384 (5.9%) were tested for HCV, and 8694 (9.8%) of individuals tested had reactive results.

Here, we discuss 3 key facets to Twitter-enabled scientific exchange during public health emergencies, including some major drawbacks. This discussion also serves as a succinct primer on some of the pivotal epidemiological analyses (and their communication) during the early phases of the COVID-19 outbreak, as seen through the lens of a Twitter feed.","320":"The extent of efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines against infection, infectiousness, or disease, impacts strategies for vaccination and testing in nursing homes. If vaccines confer some protection against infection or infectiousness, encouraging vaccination in staff may reduce symptomatic cases in residents.Nursing home residents and staff were included in the first phase of COVID-19 vaccination in the United States. Because the primary trial endpoint was vaccine efficacy (VE) against symptomatic disease, there are limited data on the extent to which vaccines protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and the ability to infect others (infectiousness). Assumptions about VE against infection and infectiousness have implications for possible changes to infection prevention guidance for vaccinated populations, including testing strategies.Increasing vaccination coverage in staff decreases total symptomatic cases in each scenario. When there is low VE against infection and infectiousness, increasing staff coverage reduces symptomatic cases among residents. If vaccination only protects against symptoms, but asymptomatic cases remain infectious, increased staff coverage increases symptomatic cases among residents through exposure to asymptomatic but infected staff. High frequency testing is needed to reduce total symptomatic cases if the vaccine has low efficacy against infection and infectiousness, or only protects against symptoms.Encouraging staff vaccination is not only important for protecting staff, but might also reduce symptomatic cases in residents if a vaccine confers at least some protection against infection or infectiousness.We use a stochastic agent-based SEIR model of a nursing home to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We model three scenarios, varying VE against infection, infectiousness, and symptoms, to understand the expected impact of vaccination in nursing homes, increasing staff vaccination coverage, and different screening testing strategies under each scenario.","321":" genus of the Bunyaviridae family. These three viruses have been found to cause disease in both livestock animals, avian species, and humans. Thus, these viruses pose a potential threat to human public health, animal health, and food security. This is especially the case in the developing nations, where BUNV and NRIV are found, mainly in Africa. BUNV and BATV are fairly well characterized, while NRIV is not well characterized owing to only sporadic detection in human and animal populations in Africa. Reassortment is common among bunyaviruses, but NRIV is believed to be the only natural reassortant of the Bunyamwera serogroup. It resulted from a combination of BUNV S and L segments and the BATV M segment. This indicates at least some level co-circulation of BUNV and BATV, which have no historically been reported to overlap in geographic distributions. But as these viruses are undercharacterized, there remains a gap in the understanding of how such reassortment could occur, and the consequences of such. Due to their combined wide range of hosts and vectors, geographic distributions, potential severity of associated diseases, and potential for transmissibility between vertebrate hosts, these viruses represent a significant gap in knowledge with important One Health implications. The goal of this review is to report available knowledge of and identify potential future directions for study of these viruses. As these are collectively understudied viruses, there is a relative paucity of data; however, we use available studies to discuss different perspectives in an effort to promote a better understanding of these three viruses and the public and One Health threat(s) they may pose.","322":"Data were drawn from a respondent-driven sample collected in 2015 of 315 PWID in 4 rural communities approximately 30-40 miles from San Juan. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to examine risk subtypes using 3 injection and 3 sexual risk indicators. In addition, demographic and other PWID characteristics were examined as possible predictors of latent class membership.Four LCA subtypes were identified: low risk (36%), high injection\/low sexual risk (22%), low injection\/high sexual risk (20%), and high risk (22%). Younger age and past year homelessness predicted high risk latent class membership, relative to the other classes. In addition, daily speedball use predicted membership in the high injection\/low sexual risk class, relative to the low risk and low injection\/high sexual risk classes.The findings suggest ways in which PWID risk clusters can be identified for targeted interventions.The purpose of this study was to examine concurrent injection and sexual risk subtypes among a rural sample of PWID in Puerto Rico.People who inject drugs (PWID) in Puerto Rico engage in high levels of injection and sexual risk behavior, and they are at high risk for HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) infection, relative to their US counterparts. Less is known, however, about the clustering of risk behavior conducive to HIV and HCV infection among rural Puerto Rican communities.","323":"If provisioned water is provided to potential hosts of D. medinensis, metal containers create the most inhospitable environment for copepods. Plastic containers have little effect on copepod mortality. The use of metal containers for water provisions could be a useful tool assisting with interruption of D. medinensis transmission among dogs.The global Guinea Worm Eradication Program has reduced numbers of human infections of Guinea worm disease (dracunculiasis) to 49 cases in four countries. However, infections of domestic animals (dogs and cats) have recently been recognized and are increasing. Typically, Guinea worm (Dracunculus medinensis) transmission occurs via ingestion of copepods from water. Despite several interventions, including tethering of dogs while worms emerge, the number of infected dogs continue to increase. One hypothesis is that dogs could be infected through ingestion of copepods in provisioned water.The purpose of this study was to evaluate if copepods can survive in water containers under typical Chadian temperatures.All copepods in the metal containers die within four hours. Conversely, after eight hours, live copepods were still present in plastic, glass, and gourd containers.Four container types (plastic, glass, gourd, and metal) were seeded with copepods and exposed to simulated Chadian temperatures.","324":"From the 1930s through the 1940s, Lowell Reed and Wade Hampton Frost used mathematical models and mechanical epidemic simulators as research tools and to teach epidemic theory to students at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (then the School of Hygiene and Public Health). Since that time, modeling has become an integral part of epidemiology and public health. Models have been used for explanatory and inferential purposes, as well as in planning and implementing public health responses. In this article, we review a selection of developments in the history of modeling of infectious disease dynamics over the past 100 years. We also identify trends in model development and use and speculate as to the future use of models in infectious disease dynamics. ","325":") a population demographic transition due to declining birth rates and increasing life expectancy. We used mathematical models to simulate these hypotheses. We show that the initial high FoI can be explained by the introduction of DENV-3 in 1994-1998, and that the overall gradual decline in the FoI can be attributed to demographic shifts. Changes in immunity and demographics strongly impacted DENV transmission in Nicaragua. Population-level measures of transmission intensity are dynamic and thus challenging to use to guide vaccine implementation locally and globally.","326":"Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae generally cannot be treated with penicillins and cephalosporins. However, some later-generation cephalosporins, including cefepime, are poorly hydrolyzed by specific ESBL enzymes, and certain strains demonstrate in vitro susceptibility to these agents, potentially affording additional treatment opportunities. Moreover, the ability to adjust both the dose and dosing interval of beta-lactam agents allows the treatment of strains with elevated MICs that were formerly classified in the intermediate range. The ability to treat strains with elevated cefepime MICs is codified in new susceptible dose-dependent (SDD) breakpoints promulgated by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. In the interest of validating and implementing new cefepime SDD criteria, we evaluated the performances of Vitek 2, disk diffusion, and a MicroScan panel compared to that of reference broth microdilution (BMD) during the testing of 64 strains enriched for presumptive ESBL phenotype (based on nonsusceptibility to ceftriaxone). Surprisingly, categorical agreement with BMD was only 47.6%, 57.1%, and 44.6% for the three methods, respectively. Given these findings, we tested the performance of the HP D300 inkjet-assisted broth microdilution digital dispensing method (DDM), which was previously described by our group as an at-will testing alternative. In contrast to commercial methods, DDM results correlated well with the reference method, with 86% categorical agreement, 91.1% evaluable essential agreement, and no major or very major errors. The reproducibility and accuracy of MIC determinations were statistically equivalent to BMD. Our results provide support for the use of the DDM as a BMD equivalent methodology that will enable hospital-based clinical laboratories to support cefepime MIC-based dosing strategies.","327":"NMES might be a cost-effective treatment option for patients with mild OSA.To assess the potential cost-effectiveness of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) for treatment of mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).From a baseline AHI of 10.2 events\/hour, NMES, OA and CPAP reduced the AHI to 6.9, 7.0 and 1.4 events\/hour respectively. Long-term therapy adherence was estimated at 65-75% for NMES and 55% for both OA and CPAP. Compared to no treatment, NMES added between 0.268 and 0.536 QALYs and between USD7,481 and USD17,445 in cost, resulting in ICERs between USD15,436 and USD57,844 per QALY gained. Depending on long-term adherence assumptions, either NMES or CPAP were found to be the preferred treatment option, with NMES becoming more attractive with younger age and assuming CPAP was not used for the full night in all patients.A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to estimate health state progression, incremental cost, and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain of NMES compared to no treatment, continuous airway pressure (CPAP), or oral appliance (OA) treatment. The base case assumed no cardiovascular (CV) benefit for any of the interventions, while potential CV benefit was considered in scenario analyses. Therapy effectiveness was based on a recent multi-center trial for NMES, and on the TOMADO and MERGE studies for OA and CPAP. Costs, considered from a United States payer perspective, were projected over lifetime for a 48-year-old cohort, 68% of whom were male. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) threshold of USD150,000 per QALY gained was applied.","328":"Health perceptions and health-related behaviors can change at the population level as cultures evolve. In the last decade, despite the proven efficacy of vaccines, the developed world has seen a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) such as measles, pertussis, and polio. Vaccine hesitancy, which is influenced by historical, political, and socio-cultural forces, is believed to be a primary factor responsible for decreasing vaccine coverage, thereby increasing the risk and occurrence of VPD outbreaks. Behavior change models have been increasingly employed to understand disease dynamics and intervention effectiveness. However, since health behaviors are culturally influenced, it is valuable to examine them within a cultural evolution context. Here, using a mathematical modeling framework, we explore the effects of cultural evolution on vaccine hesitancy and vaccination behavior. With this model, we shed light on facets of cultural evolution (vertical transmission, community influences, homophily, etc.) that promote the spread of vaccine hesitancy, ultimately affecting levels of vaccination coverage and VPD outbreak risk in a population. In addition, we present our model as a generalizable framework for exploring cultural evolution when humans' beliefs influence, but do not strictly dictate, their behaviors. This model offers a means of exploring how parents' potentially conflicting beliefs and cultural traits could affect their children's health and fitness. We show that vaccine confidence and vaccine-conferred benefits can both be driving forces of vaccine coverage. We also demonstrate that an assortative preference among vaccine-hesitant individuals can lead to increased vaccine hesitancy and lower vaccine coverage.","329":"A 3-year-old, male, entire African pygmy hedgehog (Atelerix albiventris) was presented for a 10-day history of hyporexia, mucoid green faeces and lethargy. Survey radiographs revealed a left caudal abdominal mass effect with cranial displacement and gas distension of the intestinal loops. During exploratory laparotomy, the cause of the mass effect was revealed to be grossly enlarged seminal vesicles, which were excised. Histopathology revealed uniform polycystic glandular architecture, consistent with benign cystic hyperplasia. The patient recovered and was clinically healthy at the last follow-up examination. This is the first detailed report describing the antemortem diagnosis of benign seminal vesicular cystic hyperplasia resulting in presumptive clinical gastrointestinal disease in an African pygmy hedgehog.","330":"To assess if a heterogeneous pattern on research liver ultrasound examination can identify children at risk for advanced cystic fibrosis (CF) liver disease.Research liver ultrasound examinations can identify children with CF at increased risk for developing advanced CF liver disease.Planned 4-year interim analysis of a 9-year multicenter, case-controlled cohort study (Prospective Study of Ultrasound to Predict Hepatic Cirrhosis in CF). Children with pancreatic insufficient CF aged 3-12\u00a0years without known cirrhosis, Burkholderia species infection, or short bowel syndrome underwent a screening research ultrasound examination. Participants with a heterogeneous liver ultrasound pattern were matched (by age, Pseudomonas infection status, and center) 1:2 with participants with a normal pattern. Clinical status and laboratory data were obtained annually and research ultrasound examinations biannually. The primary end point was the development of a nodular research ultrasound pattern, a surrogate for advanced CF liver disease.There were 722 participants who underwent screening research ultrasound examination, of which 65 were heterogeneous liver ultrasound pattern and 592 normal liver ultrasound pattern. The final cohort included 55 participants with a heterogeneous liver ultrasound pattern and 116 participants with a normal liver ultrasound pattern. All participants with at least 1 follow-up research ultrasound were included. There were no differences in age or sex between groups at entry. Alanine aminotransferase (42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022 U\/L vs 32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019 U\/L; P\u00a0=\u00a0.0033), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a034 U\/L vs 15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08 U\/L; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), and aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (0.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 vs 0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) were higher in participants with a heterogeneous liver ultrasound pattern compared with participants with a normal liver ultrasound pattern. Participants with a heterogeneous liver ultrasound pattern had a 9.1-fold increased incidence (95% CI, 2.7-30.8; P\u00a0=\u00a0.0004) of nodular pattern vs a normal liver ultrasound pattern (23% in heterogeneous liver ultrasound pattern vs 2.6% in normal liver ultrasound pattern).","331":"Quantification of asymptomatic infections is fundamental for effective public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Discrepancies regarding the extent of asymptomaticity have arisen from inconsistent terminology as well as conflation of index and secondary cases which biases toward lower asymptomaticity. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and World Health Organization Global Research Database on COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and April 2, 2021 to identify studies that reported silent infections at the time of testing, whether presymptomatic or asymptomatic. Index cases were removed to minimize representational bias that would result in overestimation of symptomaticity. By analyzing over 350 studies, we estimate that the percentage of infections that never developed clinical symptoms, and thus were truly asymptomatic, was 35.1% (95% CI: 30.7 to 39.9%). At the time of testing, 42.8% (95% prediction interval: 5.2 to 91.1%) of cases exhibited no symptoms, a group comprising both asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections. Asymptomaticity was significantly lower among the elderly, at 19.7% (95% CI: 12.7 to 29.4%) compared with children at 46.7% (95% CI: 32.0 to 62.0%). We also found that cases with comorbidities had significantly lower asymptomaticity compared to cases with no underlying medical conditions. Without proactive policies to detect asymptomatic infections, such as rapid contact tracing, prolonged efforts for pandemic control may be needed even in the presence of vaccination.","332":"To determine the association between immunosuppression and time to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) clearance, we studied 3758 adults retested following initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cox proportional hazards models demonstrated delayed PCR clearance with older age, multiple comorbidities, and solid organ transplant but not by degree of immunocompromise. These findings challenge current retesting practices.","333":"To support COVID-19 pandemic planning, we develop a model-inference system to estimate epidemiological properties of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern using case and mortality data while accounting for under-ascertainment, disease seasonality, non-pharmaceutical interventions, and mass-vaccination. Applying this system to study three variants of concern, we estimate that B.1.1.7 has a 46.6% (95% CI: 32.3-54.6%) transmissibility increase but nominal immune escape from protection induced by prior wild-type infection; B.1.351 has a 32.4% (95% CI: 14.6-48.0%) transmissibility increase and 61.3% (95% CI: 42.6-85.8%) immune escape; and P.1 has a 43.3% (95% CI: 30.3-65.3%) transmissibility increase and 52.5% (95% CI: 0-75.8%) immune escape. Model simulations indicate that B.1.351 and P.1 could outcompete B.1.1.7 and lead to increased infections. Our findings highlight the importance of preventing the spread of variants of concern, via continued preventive measures, prompt mass-vaccination, continued vaccine efficacy monitoring, and possible updating of vaccine formulations to ensure high efficacy.","334":"Emergence of a novel pathogen drives the urgent need for diagnostic tests that can aid in defining disease prevalence. The limitations associated with rapid development and deployment of these tests result in a dilemma: In efforts to optimize prevalence estimates, would tests be better used in the lab to reduce uncertainty in test characteristics or to increase sample size in field studies? Here, we provide a framework to address this question through a joint Bayesian model that simultaneously analyzes lab validation and field survey data, and we define the impact of test allocation on inferences of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence. In many scenarios, prevalence estimates can be most improved by apportioning additional effort towards validation rather than to the field. The joint model provides superior estimation of prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity, compared with typical analyses that model lab and field data separately, and it can be used to inform sample allocation when testing is limited.","335":"Climate change alters many aspects of weed performance, and may also alter the effectiveness of management practices to control pests. Despite this concern, entire categories of widely-used management practices, such as physical control, remain understudied in this context. We conducted a field experiment growing the invasive pest musk thistle (Carduus nutans) at ambient and experimentally elevated temperatures. We tested mowing management strategies that varied in the timing of a single mowing event relative to thistles' stem elongation phenology and compared these with an un-mowed control. Results from this experiment informed demographic models to project population growth rates for different warming\/mowing scenarios. Compared to plants grown under ambient conditions, warmed thistles were more likely to survive the same mowing treatment, flowered earlier in the season, grew to taller heights, and produced more flowering capitula. Proportional reductions in plant height and capitulum production caused by mowing were smaller under warming. Warming did not change the relative ranking of mowing treatments; mowing late in the growing season (two weeks after individuals first reached a height of 40\u2009cm) was most effective at ambient temperatures and under warming. Warming caused significant increases in projected local population growth rate for all mowing treatments. For invasive musk thistle, warmed individuals outperformed individuals grown at ambient temperatures across all of the mowing treatments we considered. Our results suggest that to achieve outcomes comparable to those attainable at today's temperatures, farmers will need to apply supplemental management, possibly including additional mowing effort or alternative practices such as chemical control. We recommend that scientists test management practices under experimental warming, where possible, and that managers monitor ongoing management to identify changes in effectiveness. Information about changes in managed weeds' mortality, fecundity, and phenology can then be used to make informed decisions in future climates.","336":"Students attending schools play an important role in the transmission of influenza. In this study, we present a social network analysis of contacts among 1,828 students in eight different schools in urban and suburban areas in and near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America, including elementary, elementary-middle, middle, and high schools. We collected social contact information of students who wore wireless sensor devices that regularly recorded other devices if they are within a distance of 3 meters. We analyzed these networks to identify patterns of proximal student interactions in different classes and grades, to describe community structure within the schools, and to assess the impact of the physical environment of schools on proximal contacts. In the elementary and middle schools, we observed a high number of intra-grade and intra-classroom contacts and a relatively low number of inter-grade contacts. However, in high schools, contact networks were well connected and mixed across grades. High modularity of lower grades suggests that assumptions of homogeneous mixing in epidemic models may be inappropriate; whereas lower modularity in high schools suggests that homogenous mixing assumptions may be more acceptable in these settings. The results suggest that interventions targeting subsets of classrooms may work better in elementary schools than high schools. Our work presents quantitative measures of age-specific, school-based contacts that can be used as the basis for constructing models of the transmission of infections in schools. ","337":"Facility location decisions significantly impact customer behavior and consequently the resulting demand in a wide range of businesses. Furthermore, sequentially realized uncertain demand enforces strategically determining locations under partial information. To address these issues, we study a facility location problem where the distribution of customer demand is dependent on location decisions. We represent moment information of stochastic demand as a piecewise linear function of facility-location decisions. Then, we propose a decision-dependent distributionally robust optimization model, and develop its exact mixed-integer linear programming reformulation. We further derive valid inequalities to strengthen the formulation. We conduct an extensive computational study, in which we compare our model with the existing (decision-independent) stochastic and robust models. Our results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed approach with remarkable improvement in profit and quality of service by extensively testing problem characteristics, in addition to computational speed-ups due to the formulation enhancements. These results draw attention to the need of considering the impact of location decisions on customer demand within this strategic-level planning problem.","338":"HIV is now considered a chronic condition, and people living with HIV, when treated, have a similar life expectancy as compared to the general population. Consequently, improving and ensuring a good health-related quality of life (HrQoL) among people living with HIV (people living with HIV) is increasingly important and has risen on the global agenda in recent years. A 'fourth 90' as 90% of people with viral load suppression have a good HrQoL should therefore be adopted alongside the other 90-90-90 targets. This study aims to report the progress on HrQoL as the 'fourth 90' and compare against the general population in the Netherlands and England.In the Netherlands, individuals attending the HIV outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital were asked to complete the EQ-5D-5L from June 2016 until December 2018. In England, individuals attending one of 73 HIV outpatient clinics were randomly sampled to complete the Positive Voices survey, which included the EQ-5D-5L, from January to September 2017. HrQoL scores were combined with demographic data and compared to general population data.The study received funding (unrestricted grants) from: Gilead sciences, ViiV Healthcare, MSD, and Jansen pharmaceuticals. for people living with HIV was high in both countries and highly comparable to the general populations Nevertheless, there should be an increased focus on anxiety and depression in the people living with HIV population The EQ-5D-5L proved an easy HrQoL measurement tool and identified areas for improvement by social and behavioural interventions. in the Netherlands and England, respectively. Of the EQ-5D domains, anxiety\/depression was mostly affected, with one-third in Dutch (35%) and almost half (47%) of English people living with HIV reporting symptoms. This was higher compared to their respective general populations (21% NL and 31% England).","339":"African American (AA) women experience much greater mortality due to breast cancer (BC) than non-Latino Whites (NLW). Clinical patient navigation is an evidence-based strategy used by healthcare institutions to improve AA women's breast cancer outcomes. While empirical research has demonstrated the potential effect of navigation interventions for individuals, the population-level impact of navigation on screening, diagnostic completion, and stage at diagnosis has not been assessed. An agent-based model (ABM), representing 50-74-year-old AA women and parameterized with locally sourced data from Chicago, is developed to simulate screening mammography, diagnostic resolution, and stage at diagnosis of cancer. The ABM simulated three counterfactual scenarios: (1) a control setting without any navigation that represents the \"standard of care\"; (2) a clinical navigation scenario, where agents receive navigation from hospital-affiliated staff; and (3) a setting with network navigation, where agents receive clinical navigation and\/or social network navigation (i.e., receiving support from clinically navigated agents for breast cancer care). In the control setting, the mean population-level screening mammography rate was 46.3% (95% CI: 46.2%, 46.4%), the diagnostic completion rate was 80.2% (95% CI: 79.9%, 80.5%), and the mean early cancer diagnosis rate was 65.9% (95% CI: 65.1%, 66.7%). Simulation results suggest that network navigation may lead up to a 13% increase in screening completion rate, 7.8% increase in diagnostic resolution rate, and a 4.9% increase in early-stage diagnoses at the population-level. Results suggest that systems science methods can be useful in the adoption of clinical and network navigation policies to reduce breast cancer disparities.","340":"The ongoing Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in the Americas poses a major global public health emergency. While ZIKV is transmitted from human to human by bites of Aedes mosquitoes, recent evidence indicates that ZIKV can also be transmitted via sexual contact with cases of sexually transmitted ZIKV reported in Argentina, Canada, Chile, France, Italy, New Zealand, Peru, Portugal, and the USA. Yet, the role of sexual transmission on the spread and control of ZIKV infection is not well-understood. We introduce a mathematical model to investigate the impact of mosquito-borne and sexual transmission on the spread and control of ZIKV and calibrate the model to ZIKV epidemic data from Brazil, Colombia, and El Salvador. Parameter estimates yielded a basic reproduction number 0\u2009=\u20092.055 (95% CI: 0.523-6.300), in which the percentage contribution of sexual transmission is 3.044% (95% CI: 0.123-45.73). Our sensitivity analyses indicate that 0 is most sensitive to the biting rate and mortality rate of mosquitoes while sexual transmission increases the risk of infection and epidemic size and prolongs the outbreak. Prevention and control efforts against ZIKV should target both the mosquito-borne and sexual transmission routes.","341":"Three of four recent major sanitation intervention trials found no effect on diarrhea. These results conflicted with longstanding beliefs from decades of literature. To understand this discordance, we placed recent trials into the historical context that preceded them in two ways. First, we evaluated the history of published literature reviews on sanitation and diarrhea. Second, we conducted meta-analyses on studies from the most recent systematic review to uncover features that predict effectiveness. We found that 13 literature reviews dating to 1983 consistently estimated a significant protective effect of sanitation against diarrhea. However, these were marred by flawed studies and inappropriately averaged effects across widely heterogeneous interventions and contexts. Our meta-analyses highlight that the overall effect of sanitation on diarrhea was largely driven by sewerage and interventions that improved more than sanitation alone. There is no true overall effect of sanitation because variability between intervention types and implementation contexts is too complex to average. Ultimately, the null effects of recent latrine interventions are not surprising. Instead, the one trial that found a strong relative reduction in diarrhea is the historical outlier. The development of transformative sanitation interventions requires a better understanding of the social and environmental contexts that determine intervention effectiveness.","342":"Meiotic recombination landscapes differ greatly between distantly and closely related taxa, populations, individuals, sexes, and even within genomes; however, the factors driving this variation are yet to be well elucidated. Here, we directly estimate contemporary crossover rates and, for the first-time, non-crossover rates in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) from four three-generation pedigrees comprising 32 individuals. We further compare these results to historical, demography-aware, linkage-disequilibrium-based recombination rate estimates. From paternal meioses in the pedigrees, 165 crossover events with a median resolution of 22.3\u2005kb were observed, corresponding to a male autosomal map length of 2357 cM - approximately 15% longer than an existing linkage map based on human microsatellite loci. In addition, 85 non-crossover events with a mean tract length of 155\u2005bp were identified - similar to the tract lengths observed in the only other two primates in which non-crossovers have been studied to date, humans and baboons. Consistent with observations in other placental mammals with PRDM9-directed recombination, crossover (and to a lesser extent non-crossover) events in rhesus macaques clustered in intergenic regions and towards the chromosomal ends in males - a pattern in broad agreement with the historical, sex-averaged recombination rate estimates -- and evidence of GC-biased gene conversion was observed at non-crossover sites.","343":"Antimicrobial resistant bacteria (ARB) have been detected in numerous wildlife species across the globe, which may have important implications for human and animal health. Wildlife can be exposed to ARB via numerous pathways, including via spatial overlap with domestic animals. However, the interface with domestic animals has mostly been explored for livestock and little is known about the interface between wild animals and companion animals. Our work suggests that urban and suburban wildlife can have similar ARB to local domestic dogs, but local dogs are unlikely to be a direct source of exposure for urban-adapted wildlife. This finding is important because it underscores the need to incorporate wildlife into antimicrobial resistance surveillance efforts, and to investigate whether certain urban wildlife species could act as additional epidemiological pathways of exposure for companion animals, and indirectly for humans.","344":"COVID-19 has had an unprecedented global impact on human health. Understanding the Ab memory responses to infection is one tool needed to effectively control the pandemic. Among 173 outpatients who had virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, we evaluated serum Ab concentrations, microneutralization activity, and enumerated SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells in convalescent human blood specimens. Serum Ab concentrations were variable, allowing for stratification of the cohort into high and low responders. Neither participant sex, the timing of blood sampling following the onset of illness, nor the number of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific B cells correlated with serum Ab concentration. Serum Ab concentration was positively associated with microneutralization activity and participant age, with participants under the age of 30 showing the lowest Ab level. These data suggest that young adult outpatients did not generate as robust Ab memory, compared with older adults. Body mass index was also positively correlated with serum Ab levels. Multivariate analyses showed that participant age and body mass index were independently associated with Ab levels. These findings have direct implications for public health policy and current vaccine efforts. Knowledge gained regarding Ab memory following infection will inform the need for vaccination in those previously infected and allow for a better approximation of population-wide protective immunity.","345":"People with a previous diagnosis of GBS were recruited through a social media advert.We used a cross-sectional design and online self-administered questionnaire survey. Question domains, based on a previous systematic review and qualitative study, covered experiences of GBS, symptom severity at each stage, healthcare and factors supporting or hindering recovery. Descriptive, exploratory factor and reliability analyses and multivariable regression analysis were used to investigate the relationships between variables of interest, explore questionnaire reliability and validity and identify factors predicting recovery.Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is a rare inflammatory peripheral nerve disorder with variable recovery. Evidence is lacking on experiences of people with GBS and measurement of these experiences.Patients were involved in developing and piloting the questionnaire.We aimed to develop and validate an instrument to measure experiences of people with GBS.The questionnaire demonstrated good internal reliability of scales and subscales and construct validity for people following GBS.A total of 291 responders, of different sexes, and marital statuses, were included, with most diagnosed between 2015 and 2019. Factor analysis showed four scales: symptoms, information provided, factors affecting recovery and care received. Positive social interactions, physical activity including physiotherapy and movement, changes made at home and immunoglobulin treatment were important for recovery. Multivariable models showed that immunoglobulin and\/or plasma exchange were significant predictors of recovery. Employment and recovery factors (positive interactions, work support and changes at work or home, physical activity and therapy), though associated with recovery, did not reach statistical significance.","346":"Data came from a subsample of the ongoing P18 Cohort Study (n = 75). GPS feasibility and acceptability among participants was measured with: 1) a pre- and post-survey and 2) adherence to the GPS protocol which included returning the GPS device, self-report of charging and carrying the GPS device as well as objective data analyzed from the GPS devices. Analyses of the feasibility surveys were treated as repeated measures as each participant had a pre- and post-feasibility survey. When comparing the similar GPS survey items asked at baseline and at follow-up, we present percentages and associated p-values based on chi-square statistics.No global positioning system (GPS) technology study has been conducted among a sample of young gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (YMSM). As such, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using GPS methods to understand the spatial context of substance use and sexual risk behaviors among a sample of YMSM in New York City, a high-risk population.Results from this pilot study demonstrate that utilizing GPS methods among YMSM is feasible and acceptable. GPS devices may be used in spatial epidemiology research in YMSM populations to understand place-based determinants of health such as substance use and sexual risk behaviors.Participants reported high ratings of pre-GPS acceptability, ease of use, and low levels of wear-related concerns in addition to few concerns related to safety, loss, or appearance, which were maintained after baseline GPS feasibility data collection. The GPS return rate was 100%. Most participants charged and carried the GPS device on most days. Of the total of 75 participants with GPS data, 75 (100%) have at least one hour of GPS data for one day and 63 (84%) had at least one hour on all 7 days.","347":"We proposed the SIkJalpha model at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (early 2020). Since then, as the pandemic evolved, more complexities were added to capture crucial factors and variables that can assist with projecting desired future scenarios. Throughout the pandemic, multi-model collaborative efforts have been organized to predict short-term outcomes (cases, deaths, and hospitalizations) of COVID-19 and long-term scenario projections. We have been participating in five such efforts. This paper presents the evolution of the SIkJalpha model and its many versions that have been used to submit to these collaborative efforts since the beginning of the pandemic. Specifically, we show that the SIkJalpha model is an approximation of a class of epidemiological models. We demonstrate how the model can be used to incorporate various complexities, including under-reporting, multiple variants, waning of immunity, and contact rates, and to generate probabilistic outputs.","348":"The World Health Organization recommends drug-susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex for all patients with tuberculosis to guide treatment decisions and improve outcomes. Whether DNA sequencing can be used to accurately predict profiles of susceptibility to first-line antituberculosis drugs has not been clear.We obtained whole-genome sequences and associated phenotypes of resistance or susceptibility to the first-line antituberculosis drugs isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide for isolates from 16 countries across six continents. For each isolate, mutations associated with drug resistance and drug susceptibility were identified across nine genes, and individual phenotypes were predicted unless mutations of unknown association were also present. To identify how whole-genome sequencing might direct first-line drug therapy, complete susceptibility profiles were predicted. These profiles were predicted to be susceptible to all four drugs (i.e., pansusceptible) if they were predicted to be susceptible to isoniazid and to the other drugs or if they contained mutations of unknown association in genes that affect susceptibility to the other drugs. We simulated the way in which the negative predictive value changed with the prevalence of drug resistance.Genotypic predictions of the susceptibility of M. tuberculosis to first-line drugs were found to be correlated with phenotypic susceptibility to these drugs. (Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and others.).A total of 10,209 isolates were analyzed. The largest proportion of phenotypes was predicted for rifampin (9660 [95.4%] of 10,130) and the smallest was predicted for ethambutol (8794 [89.8%] of 9794). Resistance to isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide was correctly predicted with 97.1%, 97.5%, 94.6%, and 91.3% sensitivity, respectively, and susceptibility to these drugs was correctly predicted with 99.0%, 98.8%, 93.6%, and 96.8% specificity. Of the 7516 isolates with complete phenotypic drug-susceptibility profiles, 5865 (78.0%) had complete genotypic predictions, among which 5250 profiles (89.5%) were correctly predicted. Among the 4037 phenotypic profiles that were predicted to be pansusceptible, 3952 (97.9%) were correctly predicted.","349":"We sought to determine whether big data from social media might reveal seasonal trends of conjunctivitis, most forms of which are nonreportable.Social media posts broadly track the seasonal occurrence of allergic and infectious conjunctivitis, and may be a useful supplement for epidemiologic monitoring.Social media posts (from Twitter, and from online forums and blogs) were classified by age and by conjunctivitis type (allergic or infectious) using Boolean and machine learning methods. Based on spline smoothing, we estimated the circular mean occurrence time (a measure of central tendency for occurrence) and the circular variance (a measure of uniformity of occurrence throughout the year, providing an index of seasonality). Clinical records from a large tertiary care provider were analyzed in a similar way for comparison.Social media posts machine-coded as being related to infectious conjunctivitis showed similar times of occurrence and degree of seasonality to clinical infectious cases, and likewise for machine-coded allergic conjunctivitis posts compared to clinical allergic cases. Allergic conjunctivitis showed a distinctively different seasonal pattern than infectious conjunctivitis, with a mean occurrence time later in the spring. Infectious conjunctivitis for children showed markedly greater seasonality than for adults, though the occurrence times were similar; no such difference for allergic conjunctivitis was seen.","350":"Toxicokinetic (TK) models link administered doses to plasma, blood, and tissue concentrations. High-throughput TK (HTTK) performs in\u00a0vitro to in\u00a0vivo extrapolation to predict TK from rapid in\u00a0vitro measurements and chemical structure-based properties. A significant toxicological application of HTTK has been \"reverse dosimetry,\" in which bioactive concentrations from in\u00a0vitro screening studies are converted into in\u00a0vivo doses (mg\/kg BW\/day). These doses are predicted to produce steady-state plasma concentrations that are equivalent to in\u00a0vitro bioactive concentrations. In this study, we evaluate the impact of the approximations and assumptions necessary for reverse dosimetry and develop methods to determine whether HTTK tools are appropriate or may lead to false conclusions for a particular chemical. Based on literature in\u00a0vivo data for 87 chemicals, we identified specific properties (eg, in\u00a0vitro HTTK data, physico-chemical descriptors, and predicted transporter affinities) that correlate with poor HTTK predictive ability. For 271 chemicals we developed a generic HT physiologically based TK (HTPBTK) model that predicts non-steady-state chemical concentration time-courses for a variety of exposure scenarios. We used this HTPBTK model to find that assumptions previously used for reverse dosimetry are usually appropriate, except most notably for highly bioaccumulative compounds. For the thousands of man-made chemicals in the environment that currently have no TK data, we propose a 4-element framework for chemical TK triage that can group chemicals into 7 different categories associated with varying levels of confidence in HTTK predictions. For 349 chemicals with literature HTTK data, we differentiated those chemicals for which HTTK approaches are likely to be sufficient, from those that may require additional data. ","351":"We estimated that vaccination had little impact in Southeast Michigan (3% cases averted (95% confidence interval (CI): 1%-8%)) but had a substantial impact in the rest of the state, preventing a larger outbreak (91% cases averted (95% CI: 85%-97%) lasting several more years.We analyzed surveillance and vaccination data from Michigan using a disease transmission model to investigate how vaccine timing and coverage influenced the spatiotemporal patterns of the outbreak, distinguishing between Southeast Michigan, where the outbreak began, and the rest of the state.The U.S. is currently experiencing the largest hepatitis A virus (HAV) outbreak since the introduction of a vaccine in 1996. More than 31,000 cases have been reported since 2016. While HAV had largely been considered a foodborne pathogen in recent years, this outbreak has been spread primarily through person-to-person transmission in urban settings and has been associated with homelessness and substance use. Michigan was one of the first states to report an outbreak, with 910 reported cases between August 2016 and December 2018.Our results emphasize the value of targeting populations where local transmission is not yet sustained rather than populations where transmission is already waning. Simulation modeling can aid in proactive rather than reactive decision making and may help direct the response to outbreaks emerging in other states.","352":"The nonresponse rate was low in our study population. Our findings suggest that the vaccines being used for the primary vaccination are probably less immunogenic for older individuals, males, and persons of Western European origin.Baseline characteristics of the study population (n\u2009=\u200911\u2009567) were as follows: mean age 27.5 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 27.23-27.72), 99.4% born in the Netherlands and 93.5% of Western European origin. Of all identified subjects, 180 (1.6%) were HBV vaccine nonresponders and 549 (4.8%) were low responders. When compared with individuals aged <40 years, the rate of nonresponse (4.3% vs 0.8%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and low response (11.9% vs 2.9%; P\u200940 years in comparison with those younger than 40 years, P\u2009<\u2009.001. All nonresponders were born in the Netherlands. Although no significant association was found between nonresponse and individuals of Western European origin (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]\u2009=\u20091.20; 95% CI, 0.66-2.44; P\u2009=\u2009.163), low response to HBV vaccination was significantly associated with Western European origin (aOR\u2009=\u20092.21; 95% CI, 1.41-3.86; P\u2009=\u2009.001). Significant determinants for nonresponse were older age at vaccination (aOR\u2009=\u20091.06; 95% CI, 1.06-1.07; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and male gender (aOR\u2009=\u20092.51; 95% CI, 1.97-3.22; P\u2009<\u2009.001).Out of 76\u2009239 individuals who received HBV vaccination between April 1983 and December 2017, 11\u2009567 persons with a known country of birth and complete vaccination schedule were included in this study. Weighted multiple logistic regression with Firth's bias adjustment was used to assess the determinants of nonresponse (anti-HBs <\u200910\u2009mIU\/mL) and low response (anti-HBs 10-99\u2009mIU\/mL).Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination is recommended to all employees who have an occupational risk in the Netherlands. This study assessed the determinants of the immune response to primary standard three-dose HBV vaccination (0, 1, 6 months), with the main focus on ethnicity.","353":"Seasonal variation in habitat use and animal behavior can alter host contact patterns with potential consequences for pathogen transmission dynamics. The endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi) has experienced significant pathogen-induced mortality and continues to be at risk of future epidemics. Prior research has found increased panther movement in Florida's dry versus wet seasons, which may affect panther population connectivity and seasonally increase potential pathogen transmission. Our objective was to determine if Florida panthers are more spatially connected in dry seasons relative to wet seasons, and test if identified connectivity differences resulted in divergent predicted epidemic dynamics. We leveraged extensive panther telemetry data to construct seasonal panther home range overlap networks over an 11\u00a0year period. We tested for differences in network connectivity, and used observed network characteristics to simulate transmission of a broad range of pathogens through dry and wet season networks. We found that panthers were more spatially connected in dry seasons than wet seasons. Further, these differences resulted in a trend toward larger and longer pathogen outbreaks when epidemics were initiated in the dry season. Our results demonstrate that seasonal variation in behavioral patterns-even among largely solitary species-can have substantial impacts on epidemic dynamics.","354":" = 2.6). We fitted a nonlinear random effects model for longitudinal observations, allowing for differences between profile groups. We used the fitted model trajectories to generate descriptive analyses of intelligibility growth by group and to generate simulations to analyze how well 36-month intelligibility data predicted 96-month data accounting for profile groups. Results Children with CP who have NSMI have different growth and better intelligibility outcomes than those with speech motor impairment. Children with SMI-LCT tend to have better outcomes but similar intelligibility growth as children with SMI-LCI. There may be a subset of children that cut across SMI-LCI and SMI-LCT groups who have severe speech motor involvement and show limited growth in intelligibility. Conclusions Intelligibility outcomes for children with CP are affected by profile group membership. Intelligibility growth tends to be delayed in children with speech motor impairment. Intelligibility at 3 years is highly predictive of later outcomes regardless of profile group. Intervention decision making should include consideration of early intelligibility, and treatment directions should include consideration of augmentative and alternative communication.","355":"This study seeks to describe the rollout and current state of South Africa's GeneXpert molecular diagnostic program for tuberculosis (TB). Xpert MTB\/RIF was introduced in 2011 with a subsequent expansion to include extra-pulmonary and paediatric testing, followed by Xpert MTB\/RIF Ultra in 2017. Through a centralised laboratory information system and the use of a standardised platform for more than a decade, over 23 million tests were analysed, describing the numbers tested, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex detection, rifampin resistance, and the unsuccessful test rates. The stratification by province, specimen type, age, and sex identified significant heterogeneity across the program and highlighted testing gaps for men, low detection yield for paediatric pulmonary TB, and the effects of inadequate specimen quality on the detection rate. The insights gained from these data can aid in the monitoring of interventions in support of the national TB program beyond laboratory operational aspects.","356":"We analyzed the epidemic doubling time of the 2019-nCoV outbreak by province in mainland China. Mean doubling time ranged from 1.0 to 3.3 days, being 2.4 days for Hubei (January 20-February 2, 2020). Trajectory of increasing doubling time by province indicated social distancing measures slowed the epidemic with some success.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementGC acknowledges support from NSF grant 1414374 as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program.

We consider the effect of human and pathogen movement on optimal vaccination strategies. A metapopulation model is used, incorporating a susceptible-infected-recovered system of differential equations coupled with an equation modelling the concentration of Vibrio cholerae in an aquatic reservoir. The model compared spatial arrangements and varying scenarios to draw conclusions on how to effectively manage outbreaks. The work is motivated by the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti. Results give guidance for vaccination strategies in response to an outbreak. ","358":"Excess mortality studies provide crucial information regarding the health burden of pandemics and other large-scale events. Here, we use time series approaches to separate the direct contribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection on mortality from the indirect consequences of the pandemic in the United States. We estimate excess deaths occurring above a seasonal baseline from March 1, 2020 to January 1, 2022, stratified by week, state, age, and underlying mortality condition (including COVID-19 and respiratory diseases; Alzheimer's disease; cancer; cerebrovascular diseases; diabetes; heart diseases; and external causes, which include suicides, opioid overdoses, and accidents). Over the study period, we estimate an excess of 1,065,200 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 909,800-1,218,000) all-cause deaths, of which 80% are reflected in official COVID-19 statistics. State-specific excess death estimates are highly correlated with SARS-CoV-2 serology, lending support to our approach. Mortality from 7 of the 8 studied conditions rose during the pandemic, with the exception of cancer. To separate the direct mortality consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection from the indirect effects of the pandemic, we fit generalized additive models (GAM) to age- state- and cause-specific weekly excess mortality, using covariates representing direct (COVID-19 intensity) and indirect pandemic effects (hospital intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy and measures of interventions stringency). We find that 84% (95% CI 65-94%) of all-cause excess mortality can be statistically attributed to the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also estimate a large direct contribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection (\u226567%) on mortality from diabetes, Alzheimer's, heart diseases, and in all-cause mortality among individuals over 65 years. In contrast, indirect effects predominate in mortality from external causes and all-cause mortality among individuals under 44 years, with periods of stricter interventions associated with greater rises in mortality. Overall, on a national scale, the largest consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are attributable to the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infections; yet, the secondary impacts dominate among younger age groups and in mortality from external causes. Further research on the drivers of indirect mortality is warranted as more detailed mortality data from this pandemic becomes available.","359":"Preventative public health measures should be focused in the south of Viet Nam where incidence is highest. Vitamin D is unlikely to be a strong driver of seasonality but supplementation may play a role in a package of interventions.There were 610,676 cases of TB notified between 2010 and 2015 in Vietnam. Heat maps of TB incidence per quarter per province showed substantial temporal and geospatial variation. Time series analysis demonstrated seasonality throughout the country, with peaks in spring\/summer and troughs in autumn\/winter. Incidence was consistently higher in the south, the three provinces with the highest incidence per 100,000 population were Tay Ninh, An Giang and Ho Chi Minh City. However, relative seasonal amplitude was more pronounced in the north. Mixed-effect linear model confirmed that TB incidence was associated with time and latitude. Of the demographic, socio-economic and health related variables, population density, percentage of those under 15\u2009years of age, and HIV infection prevalence per province were associated with TB incidence. Of the climate variables, absolute humidity, average temperature and sunlight were associated with TB incidence.Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health burden, with an estimated quarter of the world's population being infected. The World Health Organization (WHO) launched the \"End TB Strategy\" in 2014 emphasising knowing the epidemic. WHO ranks Vietnam 12th in the world of high burden countries. TB spatial and temporal patterns have been observed globally with evidence of Vitamin D playing a role in seasonality. We explored the presence of temporal and spatial clustering of TB in Vietnam and their determinants to aid public health measures.Data were collected by the National TB program of Vietnam from 2010 to 2015 and linked to the following datasets: socio-demographic characteristics; climatic variables; influenza-like-illness (ILI) incidence; geospatial data. The TB dataset was aggregated by province and quarter. Descriptive time series analyses using LOESS regression were completed per province to determine seasonality and trend. Harmonic regression was used to determine the amplitude of seasonality by province. A mixed-effect linear model was used with province and year as random effects and all other variables as fixed effects.","360":"Treatment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection is empirical and based on population-wide susceptibilities. Increasing antimicrobial resistance underscores the potential importance of rapid diagnostic tests, including sequence-based tests, to guide therapy. However, the usefulness of sequence-based diagnostic tests depends on the prevalence and dynamics of the resistance mechanisms.Quinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae and reduced cefixime susceptibility appear amenable to development of sequence-based diagnostic tests, whereas the undefined mechanisms of resistance to ceftriaxone and azithromycin underscore the importance of phenotypic surveillance. The identification of multidrug-resistant isolates highlights the need for additional measures to respond to the threat of untreatable gonorrhea.We define the prevalence and dynamics of resistance markers to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones in 1102 resistant and susceptible clinical N. gonorrhoeae isolates collected from 2000 to 2013 via the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project.Reduced extended-spectrum cephalosporin susceptibility is predominantly clonal and associated with the mosaic penA XXXIV allele and derivatives (sensitivity 98% for cefixime and 91% for ceftriaxone), but alternative resistance mechanisms have sporadically emerged. Reduced azithromycin susceptibility has arisen through multiple mechanisms and shows limited clonal spread; the basis for resistance in 36% of isolates with reduced azithromycin susceptibility is unclear. Quinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae has arisen multiple times, with extensive clonal spread.","361":"Large US colleges and universities that re-opened campuses in the fall of 2020 and the spring of 2021 experienced high per capita rates of COVID-19. Returns to campus were controversial because they posed a potential risk to surrounding communities. A large university in Pennsylvania that returned to in-person instruction for Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 semesters reported high incidence of COVID-19 among students. However, the co-located non-student resident population in the county experienced fewer COVID-19 cases per capita than reported in neighboring counties. Activity patterns from mobile devices indicate that the non-student resident population near the university restricted their movements during the pandemic more than residents of neighboring counties. Respiratory virus prevention and management in student and non-student populations requires different, specifically targeted strategies.","362":"Our method was able to classify clinical severity for 100% of patient days for 2,756 patient encounters across two institutions.We describe a detailed blueprint for how to apply the WHO-CPS scale to patient data from the EHR.Using WHO-CPS as a guideline, we developed the technical blueprint to map EHR data to ordinal clinical severity scores. We applied our approach to data from two medical centers.Implementing new clinical scales can be challenging; strong understanding of health system data architecture was integral to meet the clinical intentions of the WHO-CPS.There is a need for a systematic method to implement the World Health Organization's Clinical Progression Scale (WHO-CPS), an ordinal clinical severity score for COVID-19 patients, to electronic health record (EHR) data. We discuss our process of developing guiding principles mapping EHR data to WHO-CPS scores across multiple institutions.","363":"We systematically reviewed studies reporting rotavirus genotypes from children <5 years of age globally between 2005 and 2023. We compared rotavirus genotypes between vaccine-introducing and non-introducing settings globally and by World Health Organization (WHO) region, calendar time, and time since vaccine introduction.When accounting for both regional and temporal trends, there was no substantial evidence of long-term vaccine-related selective pressures on circulating genotypes. Increased prevalence of G2P[4] may be transient after rotavirus vaccine introduction.Even moderate differences in rotavirus vaccine effectiveness against non-vaccine genotypes may exert selective pressures on circulating rotaviruses. Whether this vaccine effect or natural temporal fluctuations underlie observed changes in genotype distributions is unclear.Crude pooling of genotype data from 361 studies indicated higher G2P[4], a non-vaccine genotype, prevalence in vaccine-introducing settings, both globally and by WHO region. This difference did not emerge when examining genotypes over time in the Americas, the only region with robust longitudinal data. Relative to non-introducing settings, G2P[4] detections were more likely in settings with recent introduction (e.g. 1-2 years post-introduction aOR: 4.39 (95% CI: 2.87-6.72)) but were similarly likely in settings with more time elapsed since introduction, (e.g. 7 or more years aOR (1.62 95% CI: 0.49-5.37)).","364":"The Southeastern region of the U.S. has the highest rate of culture positivity in Labcorp tests for total NTM and, of all positive tests, the highest proportion of M. abscessus. These estimates may underrepresent the true number of M. abscessus infections because M. absesscus-specific probes are not commercially available and not all NTM testing in the United States is done by Labcorp. Analysis of real-time testing data from commercial laboratories may provide insights into risk factors for NTM culture positivity in 'hotspot' areas.We obtained national Labcorp data for the period January 2019 through mid-April 2022. We subset the data to only respiratory samples sent for Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) cultures. NTM positive results were defined as those which identified an NTM species and are not Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, or Mycobacterium gordonae.Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are environmental bacteria which may cause chronic lung disease. The prevalence of NTM pulmonary infection and disease has been increasing in the United States and globally. The predominant clinically relevant species of NTM in the United States are Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)\u00a0species\u00a0and Mycobacterium abscessus. With the development of rapid species identification methods for NTM (e.g. PCR probes), more testing for NTM is being conducted through commercial labs, such as Laboratory Corporation of America (Labcorp), which provides deidentified real-time testing data to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) pursuant to a data sharing agreement. Because NTM lung infections are not reportable in most states, other data sources are key to understanding NTM testing patterns, positivity rates, and species distributions to track infection trends and identify clinical care needs.Overall, 112,528 respiratory samples were sent for AFB testing during the study period; 26.3% were from the Southeast U.S., identified as HSS Region IV in the Labcorp dataset, and 23.0% were from the Pacific and South Pacific region (Region IX). The culture positive prevalence ranged from 20.2% in the Southeast to 9.2% in the East North Central region (Region V). In the Southeast US, M. abscessus prevalence was 4.0%. For MAC, the highest prevalence was observed in the Mountain region (Region VII) (13.5%) and the lowest proportion was in the East South\u00a0Central region (7.3%, Region III). Among positive tests, the proportion which was MAC varied from 61.8% to 88.9% and was highest in the Northeast U.S. The proportion of positive samples which were M. abscessus ranged from 3.8% to 19.7% and was highest in the Southeast.","365":"Cystic fibrosis-related liver disease (CFLD) begins early in life. Symptoms may be vague, mild or nonexistent. Progressive liver injury may be associated with decrements in patient health before liver disease is clinically apparent. We examined Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) in children enrolled in a multi-center study of cystic fibrosis-related liver disease (CFLD) to determine the impact of early CFLD on general and disease-specific QOL.US patterns of normal (NL), heterogeneous (HTG), homogeneous (HMG), or nodular (NOD) were assigned in a prospective manner to predict those at risk for advanced CFLD. Parents were informed of results. We assessed parent\/child-reported (age\u22655 y) HRQOL by PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core and CF Questionnaire-revised (CFQ-R) prior to US and annually. HRQOL scores were compared by US pattern at baseline (prior to US), between baseline and 1-year and at 5 years. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with Hotelling-Lawley trace tested for differences among US groups.Prior to US, among 515 participants and their parents there was no evidence that HTG or NOD US was associated with reduced PedsQL\/CFQ-R at baseline. Parents of NOD reported no change in PedsQL\/CFQ-R over the next year. Child-report PedsQL\/CFQ-R (95 NL, 20 NOD) showed improvement between baseline and year 5 for many scales, including Physical Function. Parents of HMG children reported improved CFQ-R scores related to weight.Early undiagnosed or pre-symptomatic liver disease had no impact on generic or disease-specific HRQoL, and HRQoL was remarkably stable in children with CF regardless of liver involvement.An infographic is available for this article at: http:\/\/links.lww.com\/MPG\/C930.","366":"Historical WNND cases were strong predictors of future cases with minimal increase in skill achieved by models that included other factors. Although opportunities might exist to specifically improve predictions for areas with large populations and low or high winter temperatures, areas with high case-count variability are intrinsically more difficult to predict. Also, the prediction of outbreaks, which are outliers relative to typical case numbers, remains difficult. Further improvements to prediction could be obtained with improved calibration of forecast uncertainty and access to real-time data streams (e.g. current weather and preliminary human cases).Simple models based on historical WNND cases generally scored better than more complex models and combined higher discriminatory power with better calibration of uncertainty. Forecast skill improved across updated forecast submissions submitted during the 2020 season. Among models using additional data, inclusion of climate or human demographic data was associated with higher skill, while inclusion of mosquito or land use data was associated with lower skill. We also identified population size, extreme minimum winter temperature, and interannual variation in WNND cases as county-level characteristics associated with variation in forecast skill.We performed a multi-model comparative assessment of probabilistic forecasts submitted by 15 teams for annual WNND cases in US counties for 2020 and assessed forecast accuracy, calibration, and discriminatory power. In the evaluation, we included forecasts produced by comparison models of varying complexity as benchmarks of forecast performance. We also used regression analysis to identify modeling approaches and contextual factors that were associated with forecast skill.West Nile virus (WNV) is the leading cause of mosquito-borne illness in the continental USA. WNV occurrence has high spatiotemporal variation, and current approaches to targeted control of the virus are limited, making forecasting a public health priority. However, little research has been done to compare strengths and weaknesses of WNV disease forecasting approaches on the national scale. We used forecasts submitted to the 2020 WNV Forecasting Challenge, an open challenge organized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to assess the status of WNV neuroinvasive disease (WNND) prediction and identify avenues for improvement.","367":"SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategies were designed to reduce COVID-19 mortality, morbidity, and health inequities. To assess the impact of vaccination strategies on disparities in COVID-19 burden among historically marginalized populations (HMPs), e.g. Black race and Hispanic ethnicity, we used an agent-based simulation model, populated with census-tract data from North Carolina. We projected COVID-19 deaths, hospitalizations, and cases from 2020 July 1 to 2021 December 31, and estimated racial\/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. We modeled 2-stage vaccination prioritization scenarios applied to sub-groups including essential workers, older adults (65+), adults with high-risk health conditions, HMPs, or people in low-income tracts. Additionally, we estimated the effects of maximal uptake (100% for HMP vs. 100% for everyone), and distribution to only susceptible people. We found strategies prioritizing essential workers, then older adults led to the largest mortality and case reductions compared to no prioritization. Under baseline uptake scenarios, the age-adjusted mortality for HMPs was higher (e.g. 33.3%-34.1% higher for the Black population and 13.3%-17.0% for the Hispanic population) compared to the White population. The burden on HMPs decreased only when uptake was increased to 100% in HMPs; however, the Black population still had the highest relative mortality rate even when targeted distribution strategies were employed. If prioritization schemes were not paired with increased uptake in HMPs, disparities did not improve. The vaccination strategies publicly outlined were insufficient, exacerbating disparities between racial and ethnic groups. Strategies targeted to increase vaccine uptake among HMPs are needed to ensure equitable distribution and minimize disparities in outcomes.","368":"Laboratory outreach programs for K-12 students in the United States from 2020-2022 were suspended or delayed due to COVID-19 restrictions. While Southern Nevada also observed similar closures for onsite programs, we and others hypothesized that in-person laboratory activities could be prioritized after increasing vaccine doses were available to the public and masking was encouraged. Here, we describe how the Laboratory of Neurogenetics and Precision Medicine at the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) collaborated with administrators from a local school district to conduct training activities for high school students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Science Education for the Youth (SEFTY) program's curriculum was constructed to incorporate experiential learning, fostering collaboration and peer-to-peer knowledge exchange. Leveraging neuroscience tools from our UNLV laboratory, we engaged with 117 high school applicants from 2021-2022. Our recruitment efforts yielded a diverse cohort, with >41% Pacific Islander and Asian students, >9% African American students, and >12% multiracial students. We assessed the impact of the SEFTY program through pre- and post-assessment student evaluations, revealing a significant improvement of 20.3% in science proficiency (p<0.001) after participating in the program. Collectively, our laboratory curriculum offers valuable insights into the capacity of an outreach program to actively foster diversity and cultivate opportunities for academic excellence, even in the challenging context of a global pandemic.Significance Statement The Science Education for the Youth (SEFTY) program at UNLV successfully engaged 117 diverse high school students in neuroscience-based experiential learning, demonstrating the viability of in-person education during a pandemic. Significant improvements in science proficiency (20.3% increase) underscore the program's effectiveness in fostering academic excellence and diversity. This initiative potentially serves as a model for maintaining high-quality, inclusive science education in challenging times.","369":"Meta-analyses of clinical trials typically focus on one outcome at a time. However, treatment decision-making depends on an overall assessment of outcomes balancing benefit in various domains and potential risks. This calls for meta-analysis methods for combined outcomes that encompass information from different domains. When individual patient data (IPD) are available from all studies, combined outcomes can be calculated for each individual and standard meta-analysis methods would apply. However, IPD are usually difficult to obtain. We propose a method to estimate the overall treatment effect for combined outcomes based on first reconstructing pseudo IPD from available summary statistics and then pooling estimates from multiple reconstructed datasets. We focus on combined outcomes constructed from two continuous original outcomes. The reconstruction step requires the specification of the joint distribution of these two original outcomes, including the correlation which is often unknown. For outcomes that are combined in a linear fashion, misspecifications of this correlation affect efficiency, but not consistency, of the resulting treatment effect estimator. For other combined outcomes, an accurate estimate of the correlation is necessary to ensure the consistency of treatment effect estimates. To this end, we propose several ways to estimate this correlation under different data availability scenarios. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods through simulation studies and apply these to two examples: (a) a meta-analysis of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors vs control on treating type 2 diabetes; and (b) a meta-analysis of positive airway pressure therapy vs control on lowering blood pressure among patients with obstructive sleep apnea.","370":"There is great interest in the use of reduced dosing schedules for pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, a strategy premised on maintaining an acceptable level of protection against disease and carriage of the organism. We asked about the practicality of measuring differential effectiveness against carriage in a population with and without widespread use of the vaccine for infants.In a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV)-na\u00efve population, the difference in vaccine-type (VT) pneumococcal carriage prevalence between trial arms was less than 7% and varied with sampling time. In a population already receiving routine PCV administration, VT pneumococcal prevalence is nearly indistinguishable between trial arms. Relative efficacy of different dosing schedules was strongly dependent on the time between enrollment and sampling, with maximal prevalence differences reached 1-3\u2009years post-enrollment. Moreover, vaccine efficacy estimates were typically slightly higher in trials in communities already receiving vaccination. Despite this, much larger sample sizes-by more than an order of magnitude-are required for a vaccine trial conducted in a population receiving routine PCV administration as compared to in a\u00a0PCV-na\u00efve population.These findings highlight some underappreciated aspects of clinical trials of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines with efficacy endpoints, such as the context- and time-dependence of efficacy estimates. They support the wisdom of conducting comparative dose schedule trials of conjugate vaccine effects on carriage in vaccine-na\u00efve populations.We adapted an existing transmission-dynamic, individual-based stochastic model fitted to the prevaccine epidemiology of pneumococcal carriage in the United States, and compared the observed vaccine-type carriage prevalence in different arms of a simulated trial with one, two, or three infant doses plus a 12-month booster. Using these simulations, we calculated vaccine efficacy that would be estimated at different times post-enrollment in the trial and calculated required sample sizes to see a difference in carriage prevalence.","371":"Addressing the persistence of bacterial indicators using qPCR and their respective DNA targets under various conditions is a critical part of risk assessment for water quality monitoring. The goal of this study was to examine the persistence of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) via Escherichia coli uidA, enterococci 23S rDNA and Bacteroides thetataiotaomicron 1,6 alpha mannanase from cells attached to a solid matrix and in suspension. Raw sewage (10% vol\/vol) was seeded into autoclaved river water with half of the sample volume in suspension and the other half was filtered onto membranes and stored at 4\u00b0, 27\u00b0 and 37\u00b0C for up to 28 days. At various time points, DNA from cells was extracted, markers were quantified, and were fit to linear and non-linear models (first order exponential, biphasic (double) exponential, two-staged, log-logistic, and Gompertz 3-parameter). First order and biphasic exponential models fit 73% of the experimental data. Persistence increased significantly when the cells were stored in an attached state (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Increasing temperature had an inverse effect on persistence for the cells in suspension. Bacterial cells could be stored on a solid matrix at 4\u00b0, 27\u00b0 and 37\u00a0\u00b0C for up to 27, 18, and 3 days, respectively, with \u00a028 days in an attached state at all temperatures. ","372":"Access to medical treatment for fever is essential to prevent morbidity and mortality in individuals and to prevent transmission of communicable febrile illness in communities. Quantification of the rates at which treatment is accessed is critical for health system planning and a prerequisite for disease burden estimates. In this study, national data on the proportion of children under five years old with fever who were taken for medical treatment were collected from all available countries in Africa, Latin America, and Asia (n = 91). We used generalised additive mixed models to estimate 30-year trends in the treatment-seeking rates across the majority of countries in these regions (n = 151). Our results show that the proportions of febrile children brought for medical treatment increased steadily over the last 30 years, with the greatest increases occurring in areas where rates had originally been lowest, which includes Latin America and Caribbean, North Africa and the Middle East (51 and 50% increase, respectively), and Sub-Saharan Africa (23% increase). Overall, the aggregated and population-weighted estimate of children with fever taken for treatment at any type of facility rose from 61% (59-64 95% CI) in 1990 to 71% (69-72 95% CI) in 2020. The overall population-weighted average for fraction of treatment in the public sector was largely unchanged during the study period: 49% (42-58 95% CI) sought care at public facilities in 1990 and 47% (44-52 95% CI) in 2020. Overall, the findings indicate that improvements in access to care have been made where they were most needed, but that despite rapid initial gains, progress can plateau without substantial investment. In 2020 there remained significant gaps in care utilisation that must be factored in when developing control strategies and deriving disease burden estimates.","373":"Household-based interventions are the mainstay of public health policy against epidemic respiratory pathogens when vaccination is not available. Although the efficacy of these interventions has traditionally been measured by their ability to reduce the proportion of household contacts who exhibit symptoms [household secondary attack rate (hSAR)], this metric is difficult to interpret and makes only partial use of data collected by modern field studies. Here, we use Bayesian transmission model inference to analyze jointly both symptom reporting and viral shedding data from a three-armed study of influenza interventions. The reduction in hazard of infection in the increased hand hygiene intervention arm was 37.0% [8.3%, 57.8%], whereas the equivalent reduction in the other intervention arm was 27.2% [-0.46%, 52.3%] (increased hand hygiene and face masks). By imputing the presence and timing of unobserved infection, we estimated that only 61.7% [43.1%, 76.9%] of infections met the case criteria and were thus detected by the study design. An assessment of interventions using inferred infections produced more intuitively consistent attack rates when households were stratified by the speed of intervention, compared with the crude hSAR. Compared with adults, children were 2.29 [1.66, 3.23] times as infectious and 3.36 [2.31, 4.82] times as susceptible. The mean generation time was 3.39 d [3.06, 3.70]. Laboratory confirmation of infections by RT-PCR was only able to detect 79.6% [76.5%, 83.0%] of symptomatic infections, even at the peak of shedding. Our results highlight the potential use of robust inference with well-designed mechanistic transmission models to improve the design of intervention studies. ","374":"Both models were able to generate the T. cruzi seroprevalence for the next time period within reason to the historical data. The PHICOR\/CIDMA model estimates of the total population seroprevalence more closely followed the trends seen in the historic data, while the Princeton model estimates of the age-specific seroprevalence more closely followed historic trends when simulating over 9 years. Additionally, results from both models overestimated T. cruzi seroprevalence among younger age groups, while underestimating the seroprevalence of T. cruzi in older age groups.Mathematical models can help aid public health responses to Chagas disease. Models are typically developed to fulfill a particular need, and comparing outputs from different models addressing the same question can help identify the strengths and weaknesses of the models in answering particular questions, such as those for achieving the 2020 goals for Chagas disease.Using two separately developed models (PHICOR\/CIDMA model and Princeton model), we simulated dynamics for domestic transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi). We compared how well the models targeted the last 9 years and last 19 years of the 1968-1998 historical seroprevalence data from Venezuela.The PHICOR\/CIDMA and Princeton models differ in level of detail and included features, yet both were able to generate the historical changes in T. cruzi seroprevalence in Venezuela over 9 and 19-year time periods. Our model comparison has demonstrated that different model structures can be useful in evaluating disease transmission dynamics and intervention strategies.","375":"A total of 1,656 field-collected conjunctival images were obtained from clinical trial participants in Niger and Ethiopia. Images were scored for trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) and trachomatous inflammation-intense (TI) according to the simplified World Health Organization grading system by expert raters. We developed an automated procedure for image enhancement followed by application of a convolutional neural net classifier for TF and separately for TI. One hundred images were selected for testing TF and TI, and these images were not used for training.Trachoma programs base treatment decisions on the community prevalence of the clinical signs of trachoma, assessed by direct examination of the conjunctiva. Automated assessment could be more standardized and more cost-effective. We tested the hypothesis that an automated algorithm could classify eyelid photographs better than chance.The agreement score for TF and TI tasks for the automated algorithm relative to expert graders was \u03ba = 0.44 (95% CI: 0.26 to 0.62, P < 0.001) and \u03ba = 0.69 (95% CI: 0.55 to 0.84, P < 0.001), respectively.For assessing the clinical signs of trachoma, a convolutional neural net performed well above chance when tested against expert consensus. Further improvements in specificity may render this method suitable for field use.","376":"Inference of effective population size from genomic data can provide unique information about demographic history and, when applied to pathogen genetic data, can also provide insights into epidemiological dynamics. The combination of nonparametric models for population dynamics with molecular clock models which relate genetic data to time has enabled phylodynamic inference based on large sets of time-stamped genetic sequence data. The methodology for nonparametric inference of effective population size is well-developed in the Bayesian setting, but here we develop a frequentist approach based on nonparametric latent process models of population size dynamics. We appeal to statistical principles based on out-of-sample prediction accuracy in order to optimize parameters that control shape and smoothness of the population size over time. Our methodology is implemented in a new R package entitled mlesky. We demonstrate the flexibility and speed of this approach in a series of simulation experiments and apply the methodology to a dataset of HIV-1 in the USA. We also estimate the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19 in England using thousands of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. By incorporating a measure of the strength of these interventions over time within the phylodynamic model, we estimate the impact of the first national lockdown in the UK on the epidemic reproduction number.","377":"Prompt identification of infections is critical for slowing the spread of infectious diseases. However, diagnostic testing shortages are common in emerging diseases, low resource settings, and during outbreaks. This forces difficult decisions regarding who receives a test, often without knowing the implications of those decisions on population-level transmission dynamics. Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) are commonly used tools to guide clinical decisions.We found that applying this CPR (AUC: 0.69 (95% CI: 0.68 - 0.70)) to prioritize testing increased the proportion of those testing positive in settings of limited testing capacity. We found that prioritized testing led to a delayed and lowered infection peak (i.e., \"flattens the curve\"), with the greatest impact at lower values of the effective reproductive number (such as with concurrent community mitigation efforts), and when higher proportions of infectious persons seek testing. Additionally, prioritized testing resulted in reductions in overall infections as well as hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) burden.We highlight the population-level benefits of evidence-based allocation of limited diagnostic capacity.Using early SARS-CoV-2 as an example, we used data from electronic health records to develop a parsimonious 5-variable CPR to identify those who are most likely to test positive. To consider the implications of gains in daily case detection at the population level, we incorporated testing using the CPR into a compartmentalized model of SARS-CoV-2.","378":"To estimate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, attack rates, and reinfection in eastern Uganda using serologic surveillance from 2020 to early 2022.In this cohort study in a rural population in eastern Uganda, there was evidence of very high SARS-CoV-2 infection rates throughout the pandemic inconsistent with national level case data and high reinfection rates during the Omicron wave.A total of 1483 samples from 441 participants living in 76 households were tested. Of the 441 participants, 245 (55.6%) were female, and their mean (SD) age was 16.04 (16.04) years. By the end of the Delta wave and before widespread vaccination, adjusted SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 67.7% (95% credible interval [CrI], 62.5%-72.6%) in the study population. During the subsequent Omicron wave, 84.8% (95% CrI, 67.9%-93.7%) of unvaccinated, previously seronegative individuals were infected for the first time, and 50.8% (95% CrI, 40.6%-59.7%) of unvaccinated, already seropositive individuals were likely reinfected, leading to an overall seropositivity of 96.0% (95% CrI, 93.4%-97.9%) in this population. These results suggest a lower probability of reinfection in individuals with higher preexisting antibody levels. There was evidence of household clustering of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion. No significant associations were found between SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and gender, household size, or recent Plasmodium falciparum malaria exposure.This cohort study was conducted in the Tororo and Busia districts of eastern Uganda. Plasma samples from participants in the Program for Resistance, Immunology, Surveillance, and Modeling of Malaria in Uganda Border Cohort were obtained at 4 sampling intervals: October to November 2020, March to April 2021, August to September 2021, and February to March 2022. Each participant contributed up to 4 time points for SARS-CoV-2 serology, with almost half of all participants contributing at all 4 time points, and almost 90% contributing at 3 or 4 time points. Information on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status was collected from participants, with the earliest reported vaccinations in the cohort occurring in May 2021.Estimating the true burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been difficult in sub-Saharan Africa owing to asymptomatic infections and inadequate testing capacity. Antibody responses from serologic surveys can provide an estimate of SARS-CoV-2 exposure at the population level.The main outcomes of this study were antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as measured with a bead-based serologic assay. Individual-level outcomes were aggregated to population-level SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, attack rates, and boosting rates. Estimates were weighted by the local age distribution according to census data.","379":"Hepatitis C is a major public health problem in the United States and worldwide. Outbreaks of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are associated with unsafe injection practices, drug diversion, and other exposures to blood and are difficult to detect and investigate. Here, we developed and validated a simple approach for molecular detection of HCV transmissions in outbreak settings. We obtained sequences from the HCV hypervariable region 1 (HVR1), using end-point limiting-dilution (EPLD) technique, from 127 cases involved in 32 epidemiologically defined HCV outbreaks and 193 individuals with unrelated HCV strains. We compared several types of genetic distances and calculated a threshold, using minimal Hamming distances, that identifies transmission clusters in all tested outbreaks with 100% accuracy. The approach was also validated on sequences obtained using next-generation sequencing from HCV strains recovered from 239 individuals, and findings showed the same accuracy as that for EPLD. On average, the nucleotide diversity of the intrahost population was 6.2 times greater in the source case than in any incident case, allowing the correct detection of transmission direction in 8 outbreaks for which source cases were known. A simple and accurate distance-based approach developed here for detecting HCV transmissions streamlines molecular investigation of outbreaks, thus improving the public health capacity for rapid and effective control of hepatitis C. ","380":"Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 has enormous potential to contribute to COVID-19 pandemic response efforts. However, the required performance characteristics of antibody tests will critically depend on the use case (individual-level vs. population-level).","381":"We developed a method to simultaneously analyze ethinyl estradiol (EE2), etonogestrel (ENG), levonorgestrel (LNG), medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and norethisterone (NET), along with estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4), in human serum for a Shimadzu Nexera-LCMS-8050 LC-MS\/MS platform. We analyzed serum collected from women self-reporting use of oral contraceptives, contraceptive implants or injectable contraceptives (n=14) and normally cycling women using no HC (n=15) as well as pooled samples from women administered various HCs (ENG, n=6; LNG, n=14; MPA, n=7; NET, n=5).This analytical method can be used for quantitating contraceptive steroid levels in women for monitoring systemic exposure to determine drug interactions, nonadherence, misreporting and proper dosing.We have developed a robust, accurate and sensitive method for simultaneously analyzing commonly used contraceptive steroids and endogenous sex steroids in human serum.The objective was to develop a method to simultaneously quantify five commonly used hormonal contraceptives (HCs) and two endogenous sex steroids by liquid chromatography-tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) and apply this method to human serum samples.Limits of quantitation were 0.010ng\/mL for E2, EE2 and P4; 0.020ng\/mL for ENG, LNG and MPA; and 0.040ng\/mL for NET. Precisions for all assays, as indicated by coefficient of variation, were less than or equal to 12.1%. Accuracies for all assays were in the range of 95%-108%. Endogenous hormone values obtained from analysis of human serum samples are in agreement with levels previously reported in the literature for normally cycling women as well as for women taking the appropriate HC.","382":"We developed a multiyear HCV treatment budget allocation model to evaluate the tradeoffs of 7 prioritization strategies. We used optimization to identify the priority schedule that maximizes population net monetary benefit (NMB). We compared prioritization schedules in terms of the number of individuals treated, the number of individuals who progress to end-stage liver disease (ESLD), and population total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We applied the model to the population of treatment-naive patients with a total annual HCV treatment budget of US$8.6 billion.The total cost of treating the 3 million Americans chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) represents a substantial affordability challenge requiring treatment prioritization. This study compares the health and economic outcomes of alternative treatment prioritization schedules.First-come, first-served (FCFS) treats the fewest people with advanced fibrosis, prevents the fewest cases of ESLD, and gains the fewest QALYs. A schedule developed from optimizing population NMB prioritizes treatment in the first year to patients with moderate to severe fibrosis who are younger than 65 years, followed by older individuals with moderate to severe fibrosis. While this strategy yields the greatest population QALYs, prioritization by disease severity alone prevents more cases of ESLD. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the differences between prioritization schedules are greater when the budget is smaller. A 10% annual treatment price reduction enabled treatment 1 year sooner to several patient subgroups, specifically older patients and those with less severe liver fibrosis.In the absence of a sufficient budget to treat all patients, explicit prioritization targeting younger people with more severe disease first provides the greatest health benefits. We provide our spreadsheet model so that decision makers can compare health tradeoffs of different budget levels and various prioritization strategies with inputs tailored to their population.","383":"Tests of absolute model fit are crucial in model-based inference because poorly structured models can lead to biased parameter estimates. In Bayesian inference, posterior predictive simulations can be used to test absolute model fit. However, such tests have not been commonly practiced in phylogenetic inference due to a lack of convenient and flexible software. Here, we describe our newly implemented tests of model fit using posterior predictive testing, based on both data- and inference-based test statistics, in the phylogenetics software RevBayes. This new implementation makes a large spectrum of models available for use through a user-friendly and flexible interface.","384":"The malaria vector, Anopheles stephensi, which is typically restricted to South Asia and the Middle East, was recently detected in the Horn of Africa. Addressing the spread of this vector could involve integrated vector control that considers the status of insecticide resistance of multiple vector species in the region. Previous reports indicate that the knockdown resistance mutations (kdr) in the voltage-gated sodium channel (vgsc) are absent in both pyrethroid-resistant and pyrethroid-sensitive An. stephensi in eastern Ethiopia; however, similar information about other vector species in the same areas is limited. In this study, kdr and the neighboring intron were analyzed in An. stephensi, An. arabiensis, and Culex pipiens s.l. collected between 2016 and 2017 to determine the evolutionary history of kdr in eastern Ethiopia. A sequence analysis revealed that all of Cx. pipiens s.l. (N = 42) and 71.6% of the An. arabiensis (N = 67) carried kdr L1014F, which is known to confer target-site pyrethroid resistance. Intronic variation was only observed in An. stephensi (six segregating sites, three haplotypes), which was previously shown to have no kdr mutations. In addition, no evidence of non-neutral evolutionary processes was detected at the An. stephensi kdr intron, thereby further supporting the target-site mechanism not being a major resistance mechanism in this An. stephensi population. Overall, these results show key differences in the evolution of target-site pyrethroid\/dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane resistance mutations in populations of vector species from the same region. Variations in insecticide resistance mechanism profiles between eastern Ethiopian mosquito vectors may lead to different responses to insecticides used in integrated vector control.","385":"Over 390 million people worldwide are infected with dengue fever each year. In the absence of an effective vaccine for general use, national control programs must rely on hospital readiness and targeted vector control to prepare for epidemics, so accurate forecasting remains an important goal. Many dengue forecasting approaches have used environmental data linked to mosquito ecology to predict when epidemics will occur, but these have had mixed results. Conversely, human mobility, an important driver in the spatial spread of infection, is often ignored. Here we compare time-series forecasts of dengue fever in Thailand, integrating epidemiological data with mobility models generated from mobile phone data. We show that geographically-distant provinces strongly connected by human travel have more highly correlated dengue incidence than weakly connected provinces of the same distance, and that incorporating mobility data improves traditional time-series forecasting approaches. Notably, no single model or class of model always outperformed others. We propose an adaptive, mosaic forecasting approach for early warning systems.","386":"Vectored gene delivery of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) using recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) is a promising alternative to conventional vaccines for preventing new HIV-1 infections and for therapeutically suppressing established HIV-1 infections. Passive infusion of single bNAbs has already shown promise in initial clinical trials to temporarily decrease HIV-1 load in viremic patients, and to delay viral rebound from latent reservoirs in suppressed patients during analytical treatment interruptions of antiretroviral therapy. Long-term, continuous, systemic expression of such bNAbs could be achieved with a single injection of rAAV encoding antibody genes into muscle tissue, which would bypass the challenges of eliciting such bNAbs through traditional vaccination in na\u00efve patients, and of life-long repeated passive transfers of such biologics for therapy. rAAV delivery of single bNAbs has already demonstrated protection from repeated HIV-1 vaginal challenge in humanized mouse models, and phase I clinical trials of this approach are underway. Selection of which individual, or combination of, bNAbs to deliver to counter pre-existing resistance and the rise of escape mutations in the virus remains a challenge, and such choices may differ depending on use of this technology for prevention versus therapy.","387":"Testing individuals for pathogens can affect the spread of epidemics. Understanding how individual-level processes of sampling and reporting test results can affect community- or population-level spread is a dynamical modeling question. The effect of testing processes on epidemic dynamics depends on factors underlying implementation, particularly testing intensity and on whom testing is focused. Here, we use a simple model to explore how the individual-level effects of testing might directly impact population-level spread. Our model development was motivated by the COVID-19 epidemic, but has generic epidemiological and testing structures. To the classic SIR framework we have added a per capita testing intensity, and compartment-specific testing weights, which can be adjusted to reflect different testing emphases-surveillance, diagnosis, or control. We derive an analytic expression for the relative reduction in the basic reproductive number due to testing, test-reporting and related isolation behaviours. Intensive testing and fast test reporting are expected to be beneficial at the community level because they can provide a rapid assessment of the situation, identify hot spots, and may enable rapid contact-tracing. Direct effects of fast testing at the individual level are less clear, and may depend on how individuals' behaviour is affected by testing information. Our simple model shows that under some circumstances both increased testing intensity and faster test reporting can reduce the effectiveness of control, and allows us to explore the conditions under which this occurs. Conversely, we find that focusing testing on infected individuals always acts to increase effectiveness of control.","388":"As the population is ageing, small households and LTCFs become more prevalent. Additionally, families with children become smaller (i.e. low fertility, single-parent families). The overall attack rate slightly decreases as the population is ageing, but to a larger degree for influenza than for SARS-CoV-2 due to differential age-specific attack rates. Nevertheless, the number of deaths and QALY losses per 1,000 people is increasing for both infections and at a speed influenced by the share living in LTCFs.Population ageing is associated with smaller outbreaks of COVID-19 and influenza, but at the same time it is causing a substantially larger burden of mortality, even if the proportion of LTCF residents were to decrease. These relationships are influenced by age patterns in epidemiological parameters. Not only the shift in the age distribution, but also the induced changes in the household structures are important to consider when assessing the potential impact of population ageing on the transmission and burden of emerging respiratory infections.Using longitudinal individual-level data from population registers, we model the Belgian population with evolving age and household structures, and explicitly consider long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Three scenarios are presented for the future proportion of older adults living in LTCFs. For each demographic scenario, we simulate outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 and a novel influenza A virus in 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050 and distinguish between household and community transmission. We estimate attack rates by age and household size\/type, as well as disease-related deaths and the associated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost.Increasing life expectancy and persistently low fertility levels have led to old population age structures in most high-income countries, and population ageing is expected to continue or even accelerate in the coming decades. While older adults on average have few interactions that potentially could lead to disease transmission, their morbidity and mortality due to infectious diseases, respiratory infections in particular, remain substantial. We aim to explore how population ageing affects the future transmission dynamics and mortality burden of emerging respiratory infections.","389":"We developed a computational Chagas Markov model to evaluate the clinical and economic value of a therapeutic vaccine given in conjunction with benznidazole in indeterminate and chronic Chagas patients. Scenarios explored the vaccine's impact on reducing drug treatment dosage, duration, and adverse events, and risk of disease progression.When administering standard-of-care benznidazole to 1000 indeterminate patients, 148 discontinued treatment and 219 progressed to chronic disease, resulting in 119 Chagas-related deaths and 2293 DALYs, costing $18.9 million in lifetime societal costs. Compared to benznidazole-only, therapeutic vaccination administered with benznidazole (25-75% reduction in standard dose and duration), resulted in 37-111 more patients (of 1000) completing treatment, preventing 11-219 patients from progressing, 6-120 deaths, and 108-2229 DALYs (5-100% progression risk reduction), saving \u2264$16,171 per patient. When vaccinating determinate Kuschnir class 1 Chagas patients, 10-197 fewer patients further progressed compared to benznidazole-only, averting 11-228 deaths and 144-3037 DALYs (5-100% progression risk reduction), saving \u2264$34,059 per person. When vaccinating Kuschnir class 2 patients, 13-279 fewer progressed (279 with benznidazole-only), averting 13-692 deaths and 283-10,785 DALYs (5-100% progression risk reduction), saving \u2264$89,759. Therapeutic vaccination was dominant (saved costs and provided health benefits) with \u2265\u202f5% progression risk reduction, except when only reducing drug treatment regimen and adverse events, but remained cost-effective when costing <$200.Therapeutic vaccines to prevent Chagas disease progression to cardiomyopathy are under development because the only available medications (benznidazole and nifurtimox) are limited by their efficacy, long treatment course, and side effects. Better understanding the potential clinical and economic value of such vaccines can help guide development and implementation.Our study helps outline the thresholds at which a therapeutic Chagas vaccine may be cost-effective (e.g., <5% reduction in preventing cardiac progression, 25% reduction in benznidazole treatment doses and duration) and cost-saving (e.g., \u22655% and 25%, respectively).","390":". Antiviral activity was boosted when combined with Ritonavir, potentially diminishing development of drug resistance, while providing effective treatment for drug resistant HIV-1 variants.","391":"Substantial progress has been made globally to control malaria, however there is a growing need for innovative new tools to ensure continued progress. One approach is to harness genetic sequencing and accompanying methodological approaches as have been used in the control of other infectious diseases. However, to utilise these methodologies for malaria we first need to extend the methods to capture the complex interactions between parasites, human and vector hosts, and environment, which all impact the level of genetic diversity and relatedness of malaria parasites. We develop an individual-based transmission model to simulate malaria parasite genetics parameterised using estimated relationships between complexity of infection and age from 5 regions in Uganda and Kenya. We predict that cotransmission and superinfection contribute equally to within-host parasite genetic diversity at 11.5% PCR prevalence, above which superinfections dominate. Finally, we characterise the predictive power of six metrics of parasite genetics for detecting changes in transmission intensity, before grouping them in an ensemble statistical model. The model predicted malaria prevalence with a mean absolute error of 0.055. Different assumptions about the availability of sample metadata were considered, with the most accurate predictions of malaria prevalence made when the clinical status and age of sampled individuals is known. Parasite genetics may provide a novel surveillance tool for estimating the prevalence of malaria in areas in which prevalence surveys are not feasible. However, the findings presented here reinforce the need for patient metadata to be recorded and made available within all future attempts to use parasite genetics for surveillance.","392":"Identifying periods of increased vulnerability to air pollution during pregnancy with respect to the development of adverse birth outcomes can improve understanding of possible mechanisms of disease development and provide guidelines for protection of the child. Exposure to air pollution during pregnancy is typically based on the mother's residence at delivery, potentially resulting in exposure misclassification and biasing the estimation of critical windows of pregnancy. In this study, we determined the impact of maternal residential mobility during pregnancy on defining weekly exposure to particulate matter less than or equal to 10 \u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) and estimating windows of susceptibility to term low birth weight. We utilized data sets from 4 Connecticut birth cohorts (1988-2008) that included information on all residential addresses between conception and delivery for each woman. We designed a simulation study to investigate the impact of increasing levels of mobility on identification of critical windows. Increased PM10 exposure during pregnancy weeks 16-18 was associated with an increased probability of term low birth weight. Ignoring residential mobility when defining weekly exposure had only a minor impact on the identification of critical windows for PM10 and term low birth weight in the data application and simulation study. Identification of critical pregnancy windows was robust to exposure misclassification caused by ignoring residential mobility in these Connecticut birth cohorts.","393":"Wastewater surveillance has proved to be a valuable tool to track the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most studies using wastewater surveillance data revolve around establishing correlations and lead time relative to reported case data. In this perspective, we advocate for the integration of wastewater surveillance data with dynamic within-host and between-host models to better understand, monitor, and predict viral disease outbreaks. Dynamic models overcome emblematic difficulties of using wastewater surveillance data such as establishing the temporal viral shedding profile. Complementarily, wastewater surveillance data bypasses the issues of time lag and underreporting in clinical case report data, thus enhancing the utility and applicability of dynamic models. The integration of wastewater surveillance data with dynamic models can enhance real-time tracking and prevalence estimation, forecast viral transmission and intervention effectiveness, and most importantly, provide a mechanistic understanding of infectious disease dynamics and the driving factors. Dynamic modeling of wastewater surveillance data will advance the development of a predictive and responsive monitoring system to improve pandemic preparedness and population health.","394":" fungi, which likely affects both pathogen and host distributions.","395":"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted a need for better understanding of countries' vulnerability and resilience to not only pandemics but also disasters, climate change, and other systemic shocks. A comprehensive characterization of vulnerability can inform efforts to improve infrastructure and guide disaster response in the future. In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework for studying countries' vulnerability and resilience to incident disasters across multiple dimensions of society. To illustrate this methodology, we leverage the rich data landscape surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic to characterize observed resilience for several countries (USA, Brazil, India, Sweden, New Zealand, and Israel) as measured by pandemic impacts across a variety of social, economic, and political domains. We also assess how observed responses and outcomes (i.e., resilience) of the COVID-19 pandemic are associated with pre-pandemic characteristics or vulnerabilities, including (1) prior risk for adverse pandemic outcomes due to population density and age and (2) the systems in place prior to the pandemic that may impact the ability to respond to the crisis, including health infrastructure and economic capacity. Our work demonstrates the importance of viewing vulnerability and resilience in a multi-dimensional way, where a country's resources and outcomes related to vulnerability and resilience can differ dramatically across economic, political, and social domains. This work also highlights key gaps in our current understanding about vulnerability and resilience and a need for data-driven, context-specific assessments of disaster vulnerability in the future.","396":"Marine Thaumarchaeota are abundant ammonia-oxidizers but have few representative laboratory-cultured strains. We report the cultivation of Candidatus Nitrosomarinus catalina SPOT01, a novel strain that is less warm-temperature tolerant than other cultivated Thaumarchaeota. Using metagenomic recruitment, strain SPOT01 comprises a major portion of Thaumarchaeota (4-54%) in temperate Pacific waters. Its complete 1.36 Mbp genome possesses several distinguishing features: putative phosphorothioation (PT) DNA modification genes; a region containing probable viral genes; and putative urea utilization genes. The PT modification genes and an adjacent putative restriction enzyme (RE) operon likely form a restriction modification (RM) system for defence from foreign DNA. PacBio sequencing showed >98% methylation at two motifs, and inferred PT guanine modification of 19% of possible TGCA sites. Metagenomic recruitment also reveals the putative virus region and PT modification and RE genes are present in 18-26%, 9-14% and <1.5% of natural populations at 150 m with \u226585% identity to strain SPOT01. The presence of multiple probable RM systems in a highly streamlined genome suggests a surprising importance for defence from foreign DNA for dilute populations that infrequently encounter viruses or other cells. This new strain provides new insights into the ecology, including viral interactions, of this important group of marine microbes.","397":"Influenza infections result in considerable public health and economic impacts each year. One of the contributing factors to the high annual incidence of human influenza is the virus's ability to evade acquired immunity through continual antigenic evolution. Understanding the evolutionary forces that act within and between hosts is therefore critical to interpreting past trends in influenza virus evolution and in predicting future ones. Several studies have analyzed longitudinal patterns of influenza A virus genetic diversity in natural human infections to assess the relative contributions of selection and genetic drift on within-host evolution. However, in these natural infections, within-host viral populations harbor very few single-nucleotide variants, limiting our resolution in understanding the forces acting on these populations in vivo. Furthermore, low levels of within-host viral genetic diversity limit the ability to infer the extent of drift across transmission events. Here, we propose to use influenza virus genomic diversity as an alternative signal to better understand within- and between-host patterns of viral evolution. Specifically, we focus on the dynamics of defective viral genomes (DVGs), which harbor large internal deletions in one or more of influenza virus's eight gene segments. Our longitudinal analyses of DVGs show that influenza A virus populations are highly dynamic within hosts, corroborating previous findings based on viral genetic diversity that point toward the importance of genetic drift in driving within-host viral evolution. Furthermore, our analysis of DVG populations across transmission pairs indicates that DVGs rarely appeared to be shared, indicating the presence of tight transmission bottlenecks. Our analyses demonstrate that viral genomic diversity can be used to complement analyses based on viral genetic diversity to reveal processes that drive viral evolution within and between hosts.","398":"Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is a zoonotic disease caused by protozoan Leishmania infantum. Dogs with CanL are often coinfected with tick-borne bacterial pathogens, including Borrelia burgdorferi in the United States. These coinfections have been causally associated with hastened disease progression and mortality. However, the specific cellular mechanisms of how coinfections affect microbicidal responses against L. infantum are unknown. We hypothesized that B. burgdorferi coinfection impacts host macrophage effector functions, prompting L. infantum intracellular survival. In vitro experiments demonstrated that exposure to B. burgdorferi spirochetes significantly increased L. infantum parasite burden and pro-inflammatory responses in DH82 canine macrophage cells. Induction of cell death and generation of mitochondrial ROS were significantly decreased in coinfected DH82 cells compared to uninfected and L. infantum-infected cells. Ex vivo stimulation of PBMCs from L. infantum-seronegative and -seropositive subclinical dogs with spirochetes and\/or total Leishmania antigens promoted limited induction of IFN\u03b3. Coexposure significantly induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with Th17 differentiation and neutrophilic and monocytic recruitment in PBMCs from L. infantum-seropositive dogs. Excessive pro-inflammatory responses have previously been shown to cause CanL pathology. This work supports effective tick prevention and risk management of coinfections as critical strategies to prevent and control L. infantum progression in dogs.","399":"Quantifying rotavirus shedding among vaccinated individuals will aid understanding of vaccine indirect effects. Serial stool samples were collected from 196 children who presented with rotavirus gastroenteritis to health facilities in Blantyre, Malawi, and were tested for rotavirus using a VP6 semi-quantitative, real-time polymerase chain reaction. The median duration of fecal shedding was 28 days (95% CI, 19-28). The median copy numbers for peak shedding were 1.99 \u00d7 107 (interquartile range, 3.39 \u00d7 106 to 6.37 \u00d7 107). The fecal viral load was positively associated with disease severity and negatively associated with serum anti-rotavirus immunoglobin A. High and persistent rotavirus shedding among vaccinated children with breakthrough disease may contribute to ongoing transmission in this setting.","400":"We recruited smokers on Facebook using online advertisements. These recruited smokers (seeds) and subsequent waves of smokers (peer recruits) were provided the Share2Quit peer recruitment Facebook app and other tools. Smokers were incentivized for up to seven successful peer recruitments and had 30 days to recruit from date of registration. Successful peer recruitment was defined as a peer recruited smoker completing the registration on the TATI following a referral. Our primary questions were (1) whether smokers would recruit other smokers and (2) whether peer recruitment would extend the reach of the intervention to harder-to-reach groups, including those not ready to quit and minority smokers.Overall, 759 smokers were recruited (seeds: 190; peer recruits: 569). Fifteen percent (n = 117) of smokers successfully recruited their peers (seeds: 24.7%; peer recruits: 7.7%) leading to four recruitment waves. Compared to seeds, peer recruits were less likely to be ready to quit (peer recruits 74.2% vs. seeds 95.1%), more likely to be male (67.1% vs. 32.9%), and more likely to be African American (23.8% vs. 10.8%) (p < .01 for all comparisons).Although technology-assisted tobacco interventions (TATIs) are effective, they are underused due to recruitment challenges. We tested whether we could successfully recruit smokers to a TATI using peer marketing through a social network (Facebook).This study demonstrates the successful recruitment of smokers to a TATI using a Facebook-based peer marketing strategy. Smokers on Facebook were willing and able to recruit other smokers to a TATI, yielding a large and diverse population of smokers.Peer marketing quadrupled our engaged smokers and enriched the sample with not-ready-to-quit and African American smokers. Peer recruitment is promising, and our study uncovered several important challenges for future research.","401":"Quantifying the variation of pathogens' life history traits in multiple host systems is crucial to understand their transmission dynamics. It is particularly important for arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), which are prone to infecting several species of vertebrate hosts. Here, we focus on how host-pathogen interactions determine the ability of host species to transmit a virus to susceptible vectors upon a potentially infectious contact. Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral, vector-borne, zoonotic disease, chosen as a case study. The relative contributions of livestock species to RVFV transmission has not been previously quantified. To estimate their potential to transmit the virus over the course of their infection, we 1) fitted a within-host model to viral RNA and infectious virus measures, obtained daily from infected lambs, calves, and young goats, 2) estimated the relationship between vertebrate host infectious titers and probability to infect mosquitoes, and 3) estimated the net infectiousness of each host species over the duration of their infectious periods, taking into account different survival outcomes for lambs. Our results indicate that the efficiency of viral replication, along with the lifespan of infectious particles, could be sources of heterogeneity between hosts. Given available data on RVFV competent vectors, we found that, for similar infectious titers, infection rates in the Aedes genus were on average higher than in the Culex genus. Consequently, for Aedes-mediated infections, we estimated the net infectiousness of lambs to be 2.93 (median) and 3.65 times higher than that of calves and goats, respectively. In lambs, we estimated the overall infectiousness to be 1.93 times higher in individuals which eventually died from the infection than in those recovering. Beyond infectiousness, the relative contributions of host species to transmission depend on local ecological factors, including relative abundances and vector host-feeding preferences. Quantifying these contributions will ultimately help design efficient, targeted, surveillance and vaccination strategies.","402":"Dengue remains the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease in humans. While probing for blood vessels, Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes transmit the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1-4) by injecting virus-containing saliva into the skin. Even though arthropod saliva is known to facilitate transmission and modulate host responses to other pathogens, the full impact of mosquito saliva on dengue pathogenesis is still not well understood. Inoculating mice lacking the interferon-\u03b1\/\u03b2 receptor intradermally with DENV revealed that mosquito salivary gland extract (SGE) exacerbates dengue pathogenesis specifically in the presence of enhancing serotype-cross-reactive antibodies-when individuals already carry an increased risk for severe disease. We further establish that SGE increases viral titers in the skin, boosts antibody-enhanced DENV infection of dendritic cells and macrophages in the dermis, and amplifies dendritic cell migration to skin-draining lymph nodes. We demonstrate that SGE directly disrupts endothelial barrier function in vitro and induces endothelial permeability in vivo in the skin. Finally, we show that surgically removing the site of DENV transmission in the skin after 4 hours rescued mice from disease in the absence of SGE, but no longer prevented lethal antibody-enhanced disease when SGE was present. These results indicate that SGE accelerates the dynamics of dengue pathogenesis after virus transmission in the skin and induces severe antibody-enhanced disease systemically. Our study reveals novel aspects of dengue pathogenesis and suggests that animal models of dengue and pre-clinical testing of dengue vaccines should consider mosquito-derived factors as well as enhancing antibodies.","403":"Cox models with time-dependent coefficients and covariates are widely used in survival analysis. In high-dimensional settings, sparse regularization techniques are employed for variable selection, but existing methods for time-dependent Cox models lack flexibility in enforcing specific sparsity patterns (ie, covariate structures). We propose a flexible framework for variable selection in time-dependent Cox models, accommodating complex selection rules. Our method can adapt to arbitrary grouping structures, including interaction selection, temporal, spatial, tree, and directed acyclic graph structures. It achieves accurate estimation with low false alarm rates. We develop the sox package, implementing a network flow algorithm for efficiently solving models with complex covariate structures. sox offers a user-friendly interface for specifying grouping structures and delivers fast computation. Through examples, including a case study on identifying predictors of time to all-cause death in atrial fibrillation patients, we demonstrate the practical application of our method with specific selection rules.","404":"To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of current Medicaid policies restricting hepatitis C treatment to patients with advanced disease compared with a strategy providing unrestricted access to hepatitis C treatment, assess the budget and public health impact of each strategy, and estimate the feasibility and long-term effects of increased access to treatment for patients with hepatitis C.Current Medicaid policies restricting hepatitis C treatment to patients with advanced disease are more costly and less effective than unrestricted, full-access strategies. Collaboration between state and federal payers may be needed to realize the full public health impact of recent innovations in hepatitis C treatment.Using a Markov model, we compared two strategies for 45- to 55-year-old Medicaid beneficiaries: 1) Current Practice-only advanced disease is treated before Medicare eligibility and 2) Full Access-both early-stage and advanced disease are treated before Medicare eligibility. Patients could develop progressive fibrosis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma, undergo transplantation, or die each year. Morbidity was reduced after successful treatment. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and compared the costs and public health effects of each strategy from the perspective of Medicare alone as well as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services perspective. We varied model inputs in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.Full Access was less costly and more effective than Current Practice for all cohorts and perspectives, with differences in cost ranging from $5,369 to $11,960 and in effectiveness from 0.82 to 3.01 quality-adjusted life-years. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, Full Access was cost saving in 93% of model iterations. Compared with Current Practice, Full Access averted 5,994 hepatocellular carcinoma cases and 121 liver transplants per 100,000 patients.Interferon-free hepatitis C treatment regimens are effective but very costly. The cost-effectiveness, budget, and public health impacts of current Medicaid treatment policies restricting treatment to patients with advanced disease remain unknown.","405":"Forecasts of the trajectory of an infectious agent can help guide public health decision making. A traditional approach to forecasting fits a computational model to structured data and generates a predictive distribution. However, human judgment has access to the same data as computational models plus experience, intuition, and subjective data. We propose a chimeric ensemble-a combination of computational and human judgment forecasts-as a novel approach to predicting the trajectory of an infectious agent. Each month from January, 2021 to June, 2021 we asked two generalist crowds, using the same criteria as the COVID-19 Forecast Hub, to submit a predictive distribution over incident cases and deaths at the US national level either two or three weeks into the future and combined these human judgment forecasts with forecasts from computational models submitted to the COVID-19 Forecasthub into a chimeric ensemble. We find a chimeric ensemble compared to an ensemble including only computational models improves predictions of incident cases and shows similar performance for predictions of incident deaths. A chimeric ensemble is a flexible, supportive public health tool and shows promising results for predictions of the spread of an infectious agent.","406":"Infectious disease epidemiology is increasingly reliant on large-scale computation and inference. Models have guided health policy for epidemics including COVID-19 and Ebola and endemic diseases including malaria and tuberculosis. Yet a coding bug may bias results, yielding incorrect conclusions and actions causing avoidable harm. We are ethically obliged to make our code as free of error as possible. Unit testing is a coding method to avoid such bugs, but it is rarely used in epidemiology. We demonstrate how unit testing can handle the particular quirks of infectious disease models and aim to increase the uptake of this methodology in our field.","407":"To determine whether ocular trauma occurs more frequently in the summer months.Retrospective, cross-sectional study.Eye trauma, although decreasing in incidence, is a seasonal condition. Prevention efforts would likely be most effective if implemented in the spring or summer months. Further study to identify other individual-level or regional-level factors that would most benefit from public health efforts is warranted.The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) is a large, publicly available administrative database that provides nationally representative estimates of emergency department (ED) visits in the United States. Billing codes from NEDS from 2006 to 2013 were used to identify all cases of ocular trauma, and the United States decennial census was used to estimate the population at risk for visiting an ED. The main outcome measures were the seasonal and annual trends in the incidence of ED-diagnosed eye trauma.Eye trauma was the primary diagnosis for an estimated 5 615 532 ED encounters over the 8-year study period. Those with an eye trauma encounter were predominantly male (66%) and under 60 years of age (91%). The most common ocular trauma presentations were superficial injury of eye and adnexa (101 ED-diagnosed cases per 100 000 population), extraocular foreign body (54 per 100 000 population), contusion of eye and adnexa (27 per 100 000 population), and ocular adnexal open wound (26 per 100 000 population). Each exhibited a statistically significant annual cycle, with a mean annual peak between May and July (P < .01 for each, Edwards test). Eye trauma visits decreased by an average of 4% per year over the study period, with a similar pattern of decline during each calendar month (incidence rate ratio 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.94-0.98).","408":"Accurate data extraction is a key component of evidence synthesis and critical to valid results. The advent of publicly available large language models (LLMs) has generated interest in these tools for evidence synthesis and created uncertainty about the choice of LLM. We compare the performance of two widely available LLMs (Claude 2 and GPT-4) for extracting pre-specified data elements from 10 published articles included in a previously completed systematic review. We use prompts and full study PDFs to compare the outputs from the browser versions of Claude 2 and GPT-4. GPT-4 required use of a third-party plugin to upload and parse PDFs. Accuracy was high for Claude 2 (96.3%). The accuracy of GPT-4 with the plug-in was lower (68.8%); however, most of the errors were due to the plug-in. Both LLMs correctly recognized when prespecified data elements were missing from the source PDF and generated correct information for data elements that were not reported explicitly in the articles. A secondary analysis demonstrated that, when provided selected text from the PDFs, Claude 2 and GPT-4 accurately extracted 98.7% and 100% of the data elements, respectively. Limitations include the narrow scope of the study PDFs used, that prompt development was completed using only Claude 2, and that we cannot guarantee the open-source articles were not used to train the LLMs. This study highlights the potential for LLMs to revolutionize data extraction but underscores the importance of accurate PDF parsing. For now, it remains essential for a human investigator to validate LLM extractions.","409":"We used a network model to simulate a monkeypox epidemic among men who have sex with men. Our findings suggest that unrecognized infections have an important impact on the epidemic, and that vaccination of individuals at highest risk of infection reduces epidemic size more than post-exposure vaccination of sexual partners.","410":"A difference in the average total direct expenditures between uninsured and privately insured patients was found. Uninsured had the lowest health care utilization while Medicaid reported significantly higher number of ER visits. Despite differences in program structures, health care expenditures across insurance types were similar. Lower utilization of health care services among uninsured suggests cost maybe a barrier to accessing care.A total of 1140 (weighted\u00a0=\u00a013.9 million) cancer survivors were identified. Compared to the adjusted mean annual health care expenditures for the private group ($14,265; 95% confidence interval (CI): $12,645 to $16,092), the adjusted mean annual health care expenditures for the Medicare group were higher ($15,112; 95%CI: $13,361 to $17,092). As compared to the private group, the average annual expenditures for uninsured cancer survivors ($2315; 95%CI:1038 to $3501) was significantly lower and so was their health care utilization. Adjusted rates of ER visits for Medicaid were twice (AIRR:2.04; SE:0.28; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) as compared to privately insured.A cross-sectional study of cancer survivors aged \u226518 years, identified from the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS) during 2017 using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes specific for cancer. Health insurance was categorized into Private, Medicare, Medicaid, and uninsured. Multivariable ordinary least squares regression was used to examine the association between log expenditures and health insurance. Negative binomial regression with log link was used to obtain adjusted incident rate ratios (AIRR) for health care utilization. Survey weights were used to produce nationally representative estimates of the US population.Health care expenditures for cancer care has increased significantly over the past decade and is further projected to rise. This study examined the associations between health insurance status and total direct health care expenditures and health care utilization among cancer survivors living in the United States.","411":"Prioritizing PrEP for adolescents had a negligible impact on incidence. At 50% uptake among eligible adolescents and 90% ART coverage, including adolescents only improved the percentage of infections averted from 80.1% to 80.3%. In 10 of 15 scenarios explored, there was no reduction in new infections when PrEP eligibility was expanded to include adolescents age<18. At 95% ART coverage at the population-level incidence among adolescents declined by over 80%, but PrEP uptake among adolescents did not contribute to additional declines in incidence among adolescents.An HIV-transmission model was built to simulate the HIV epidemic in the South. Increased ART and PrEP uptake were systematically varied with and without PrEP eligibility including individuals age<18.The \"Ending the HIV Epidemic\" (EHE) initiative seeks to reduce new HIV infections in the U.S. by prioritizing federal resources towards highly impacted populations. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are essential for reaching EHE goals. Adolescents are often at increased risk for HIV because they may lack agency in negotiating their sexual partnerships and may not have the same access to treatment and prevention as adults. This study estimates the potential contribution of expanded PrEP coverage among adolescents ages 15-17 to achieving the EHE goals in the South.Prioritizing PrEP for adolescents did not significantly contribute to reaching EHE incidence reductions goal. Focusing resources to specific adolescent populations at risk, such sexual minority males in high incidence settings, will remain an important public health goal outside the context of EHE.","412":"Evolving in sync with the computation revolution over the past 30 years, computational biology has emerged as a mature scientific field. While the field has made major contributions toward improving scientific knowledge and human health, individual computational biology practitioners at various institutions often languish in career development. As optimistic biologists passionate about the future of our field, we propose solutions for both eager and reluctant individual scientists, institutions, publishers, funding agencies, and educators to fully embrace computational biology. We believe that in order to pave the way for the next generation of discoveries, we need to improve recognition for computational biologists and better align pathways of career success with pathways of scientific progress. With 10 outlined steps, we call on all adjacent fields to move away from the traditional individual, single-discipline investigator research model and embrace multidisciplinary, data-driven, team science.","413":"Oscine songbirds have been an important study system for social learning, particularly because their learned songs provide an analog for human languages and music. Here we propose a different analogy: from an evolutionary perspective, could birds' songs change over time more like arrowheads than arias? Small improvements to a bird's song can lead to large fitness differences for its singer, which could make songs more analogous to human tools than languages. We modify a model of human tool evolution to accommodate cultural evolution of birdsong: each song learner chooses the most skilled available tutor to emulate, and each is more likely to produce an inferior copy than a superior one. Similarly to human tool evolution, our model suggests that larger populations of birds could foster improvements in song over time, even when learners restrict their pool of tutors to a subset of individuals in their social network. We also demonstrate that song elements could be simplified instead of lost after population bottlenecks if lower-quality traits are easier to imitate than higher-quality ones. We show that these processes could plausibly generate empirically observed patterns of song evolution for some song traits, and we make predictions about the types of song elements most likely to be lost when populations shrink. More broadly, we aim to connect the modeling approaches used in human and non-human systems, moving toward a cohesive theoretical framework that accounts for both cognitive and demographic processes.

Cases with chromosomal abnormalities or neural tube defects were excluded. The association between cCMV and microcephaly was estimated in the pooled cohort using prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% CIs.Congenital cytomegalovirus infection increases the prevalence of microcephaly at birth by at least 7-fold. Prevention of CMV infection during pregnancy might substantially reduce the number of newborns with microcephaly and other cCMV-related outcomes in the United States.Congenital cytomegalovirus infection documented in inpatient or outpatient newborn claims records.In the pooled cohort of 2\u202f338\u202f580 pregnancies (2\u202f075\u202f410 pregnancies [88.7%] were among women younger than 35 years), 336 infants (0.014%) had a cCMV diagnosis. The prevalence of microcephaly among newborns with and without a cCMV diagnosis was 655 and 2.8 per 10\u202f000 live births, respectively (PR, 232; 95% CI, 154-350). After restricting to CMV-tested newborns (572 [0.024%]) to correct for preferential testing of infants with microcephaly, the PR was 15 (95% CI, 5.2-41). However, this PR is biased if other cCMV-related outcomes (eg, hearing loss) trigger testing because cCMV prevalence in tested infants, with ([46%]) or without microcephaly (22 of 559 [3.9%]), would overestimate that in the source population. Therefore, the prevalence of cCMV in overall infants with microcephaly (22 of 669 [3.2%]) was compared with that from an external unbiased sample of US infants screened at birth (449 of 100\u202f332 [0.45%]) to estimate a PR of 7.4 (95% CI, 4.8-11.5) as a conservative lower bound.Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) has received far less clinical and public health attention as a teratogenic infection than the Zika virus epidemic. However, cCMV may be responsible for a large fraction of microcephaly cases in the United States.This population-based cohort study included pregnant women and their newborns identified in 2 insurance claims databases from the United States: Medicaid Analytic eXtract (January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2013) and IBM Research MarketScan, a database for employer-sponsored private health insurance (January 1, 2011, to September 30, 2015). All pregnancies that resulted in live births in women with full health benefits were included. Analysis began June 2016 and ended May 2020.","415":"Introducci\u00f3n: la pobreza es un determinante sensible del estado de salud de una poblaci\u00f3n y directamente relacionado con la presencia de algunas condiciones patol\u00f3gicas.

Materiales y m\u00e9todos: se realiz\u00f3 estudio ecol\u00f3gico que mide las desigualdades regionales de la tasa de mortalidad infantil (TMI) en Colombia, para los a\u00f1os de los censos de poblaci\u00f3n de 1993 y 2005. Para esto se utilizaron indicadores como: raz\u00f3n y diferencia de tasas (RT y DT), \u00edndice de efecto y riesgo atribuible poblacional (RAP). Resultados: en 1993 la diferencia absoluta entre los departamentos con mayor y menor pobreza (Choc\u00f3: 80.4%; Bogot\u00e1, D.C.:17.3%) fue 63.1%. Para 2005, esta diferencia pas\u00f3 a ser del 70.4%. Para los mismos a\u00f1os, entre estos departamentos la RT de mortalidad infantil fue de 2.9 y 4.2 y las DT fue de 56.4 y 59.2 respectivamente.

It varies greatly in different populations geographically and based on criteria used to diagnose the disease. This review was conducted to determine the prevalence of MetS among apparently healthy adults of Pakistan. A systematic review was performed on Medline\/PubMed, SCOPUS, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases until July 2022. Articles published on Pakistani healthy adult population reporting MetS were included. Pooled prevalence was reported with 95% confidence interval (CI). Of 440 articles, 20 articles met the eligibility.The pooled prevalence of MetS was 28.8% (95% CI: 17.8-39.7). The maximum prevalence was from a sub-urban village of Punjab (68%, 95% CI: 66.6-69.3) and Sindh province (63.7%, 95% CI: 61.1-66.3). International Diabetes Federation guidelines had shown 33.2% (95% CI: 18.5-48.0) whereas National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines showed 23.9% (95% CI: 8.0-39.8) prevalence of MetS. Furthermore, individuals with low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 48.2% (95% CI: 30.8-65.6), central obesity 37.1% (95% CI: 23.7-50.5), and high triglyceride 35.8% (95% CI: 24.3-47.3) showed higher prevalence.A considerably higher prevalence of MetS was observed among apparently healthy individuals in Pakistan. High triglyceride, low HDL, and central obesity were found as significant risk factors.

Previous estimates of the ratio of infections to clinical cases have varied widely (2 to 100). Understanding cholera epidemiology and immunity relies on the ability to translate between numbers of clinical cases and the underlying number of infections in the population. We estimated the infection incidence during the first months of an outbreak in a cholera-naive population using a Bayesian vibriocidal antibody titer decay model combining measurements from a representative serosurvey and clinical surveillance data. 3,880 suspected cases were reported in Grande Saline, Haiti, between 20 October 2010 and 6 April 2011 (clinical attack rate 18.4%). We found that more than 52.6% (95% Credible Interval (CrI) 49.4-55.7) of the population \u22652 years showed serologic evidence of infection, with a lower infection rate among children aged 2-4 years (35.5%; 95%CrI 24.2-51.6) compared with people \u22655 years (53.1%; 95%CrI 49.4-56.4). This estimated infection rate, nearly three times the clinical attack rate, with underdetection mainly seen in those \u22655 years, has likely impacted subsequent outbreak dynamics. Our findings show how seroincidence estimates improve understanding of links between cholera burden, transmission dynamics and immunity.","418":"Quinolone consumption in the community is no longer increasing in the EU\/EEA, but its seasonal variation continues to increase significantly as is the proportion of quinolones to treat respiratory infections.For the period 1997-2017, data on consumption of quinolones, i.e. ATC group J01M, in the community and aggregated at the level of the active substance, were collected using the WHO ATC\/DDD methodology (ATC\/DDD index 2019). Consumption was expressed in DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day and in packages per 1000 inhabitants per day. Quinolone consumption was analysed by subgroups based on pharmacokinetic profile, and presented as trends, seasonal variation, presence of change-points and compositional changes.In 2017, quinolone consumption in the community expressed in DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day varied by a factor of 8.2 between countries with the highest (Bulgaria) and the lowest (Norway) consumption. The second-generation quinolones accounted for >50% of quinolone consumption in most countries. Quinolone consumption significantly increased up to 2001, and did not change significantly afterwards. Seasonal variation increased significantly over time. Proportional consumption of third-generation quinolones significantly increased over time relative to that of second-generation quinolones, while proportional consumption of both third- and second-generation quinolones significantly increased relative to that of first-generation quinolones. Levofloxacin and moxifloxacin represented >40% of quinolone consumption in the community in southern EU\/EEA countries.Data on quinolone consumption in the community were collected from 30 EU\/European Economic Area (EEA) countries over two decades. This article reviews temporal trends, seasonal variation, presence of change-points and changes in the composition of main subgroups of quinolones.","419":"Our transmission model suggests that maternal protection of infants is seasonal, with 38-62% of infants born with protection against RSV. Our economic analysis found that to cost-effectively and affordably replace the current monoclonal antibody Palivizumab programme with long-acting monoclonal antibodies, the purchase price per dose would have to be less than around \u00a34350 but dropping to \u00a3200 for vaccinated heightened risk infants or \u00a390 for all infants. A seasonal maternal vaccine would have to be priced less than \u00a385 to be cost-effective and affordable. While vaccinating pre-school and school-age children is likely not cost-effective relative to elderly vaccination programmes, vaccinating the elderly is not likely to be affordable. Conversely, vaccinating infants at 2\u2009months seasonally would be cost-effective and affordable if priced less than \u00a380.In a setting with seasonal RSV epidemiology, maternal protection conferred to newborns is also seasonal, an assumption not previously incorporated in transmission models of RSV. For a country with seasonal RSV dynamics like England, seasonal programmes rather than year-round intervention programmes are always optimal.To compare the next generation of RSV prophylactics, we integrated a novel transmission model with an economic analysis. We estimated key epidemiological parameters by calibrating the model to 7\u00a0years of historical epidemiological data using a Bayesian approach. We determined the cost-effective and affordable maximum purchase price for a comprehensive suite of intervention programmes.With a suite of promising new RSV prophylactics on the horizon, including long-acting monoclonal antibodies and new vaccines, it is likely that one or more of these will replace the current monoclonal Palivizumab programme. However, choosing the optimal intervention programme will require balancing the costs of the programmes with the health benefits accrued.","420":"A prospective, observational study in 17 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and South America, including adults with confirmed COVID-19 assessed at 2 to <6\u2009and 6 to <12 months post-hospital discharge. A standardised case report form developed by International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium's Global COVID-19 Follow-up working group evaluated the frequency of fever, persistent symptoms, breathlessness (MRC dyspnoea scale), fatigue and impact on daily activities.A proportion of people develop Long Covid after acute COVID-19, but with most studies concentrated in high-income countries (HICs), the global burden is largely unknown. Our study aims to characterise long-term COVID-19 sequelae in populations globally and compare the prevalence of reported symptoms in HICs and low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).Our data show that Long Covid affects populations globally, manifesting similar symptomatology and impact on functioning in both HIC and LMICs. The prevalence was higher in HICs versus LMICs. Although we identified a lower prevalence, the impact of Long Covid may be greater in LMICs if there is a lack of support systems available in HICs. Further research into the aetiology of Long Covid and the burden in LMICs is critical to implement effective, accessible treatment and support strategies to improve COVID-19 outcomes for all.Of 11\u2009860 participants (median age: 52 (IQR: 41-62) years; 52.1% females), 56.5% were from HICs and 43.5% were from LMICs. The proportion identified with Long Covid was significantly higher in HICs vs LMICs at both assessment time points (69.0% vs 45.3%, p<0.001; 69.7% vs 42.4%, p<0.001). Participants in HICs were more likely to report not feeling fully recovered (54.3% vs 18.0%, p<0.001; 56.8% vs 40.1%, p<0.001), fatigue (42.9% vs 27.9%, p<0.001; 41.6% vs 27.9%, p<0.001), new\/persistent fever (19.6% vs 2.1%, p<0.001; 20.3% vs 2.0%, p<0.001) and have a higher prevalence of anxiety\/depression and impact on usual activities compared with participants in LMICs at 2 to <6\u2009and 6 to <12 months post-COVID-19 hospital discharge, respectively.","421":"We analyze a network of needle-sharing ties among 117 people who inject drugs (PWID) in rural Puerto Rico, using exponential random graph modeling to examine whether network members engage in partner restriction to lower their risk of contracting HIV or hepatitis C (HCV), or in informed altruism to prevent others from contracting these infections. Although sharing of used syringes is a significant risk factor for transmission of these diseases among PWID, we find limited evidence for partner restriction or informed altruism in the network of reported needle-sharing ties. We find however that sharing of needles is strongly reciprocal, and individuals with higher injection frequency are more likely to have injected with a used needle. Drawing on our ethnographic work, we discuss how the network structures we observe may relate to a decision-making rationale focused on avoiding withdrawal sickness, which leads to risk-taking behaviors in this poor, rural context where economic considerations often lead PWID to cooperate in the acquisition and use of drugs.","422":"To mitigate the effects of zoonotic diseases on human and animal populations, it is critical to understand what factors alter transmission dynamics. Here we assess the risk of exposure to lethal concentrations of the anthrax bacterium, Bacillus anthracis, for grazing animals in a natural system over time through different transmission mechanisms. We follow pathogen concentrations at anthrax carcass sites and waterholes for five years and estimate infection risk as a function of grass, soil or water intake, age of carcass sites, and the exposure required for a lethal infection. Grazing, not drinking, seems the dominant transmission route, and transmission is more probable from grazing at carcass sites 1-2 years of age. Unlike most studies of virulent pathogens that are conducted under controlled conditions for extrapolation to real situations, we evaluate exposure risk under field conditions to estimate the probability of a lethal dose, showing that not all reservoirs with detectable pathogens are significant transmission pathways.","423":"We used data from the largest health care organization in Israel to evaluate the safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. For each potential adverse event, in a population of persons with no previous diagnosis of that event, we individually matched vaccinated persons to unvaccinated persons according to sociodemographic and clinical variables. Risk ratios and risk differences at 42 days after vaccination were derived with the use of the Kaplan-Meier estimator. To place these results in context, we performed a similar analysis involving SARS-CoV-2-infected persons matched to uninfected persons. The same adverse events were studied in the vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection analyses.In the vaccination analysis, the vaccinated and control groups each included a mean of 884,828 persons. Vaccination was most strongly associated with an elevated risk of myocarditis (risk ratio, 3.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.55 to 12.44; risk difference, 2.7 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 1.0 to 4.6), lymphadenopathy (risk ratio, 2.43; 95% CI, 2.05 to 2.78; risk difference, 78.4 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 64.1 to 89.3), appendicitis (risk ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.01; risk difference, 5.0 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 0.3 to 9.9), and herpes zoster infection (risk ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.73; risk difference, 15.8 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 8.2 to 24.2). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a substantially increased risk of myocarditis (risk ratio, 18.28; 95% CI, 3.95 to 25.12; risk difference, 11.0 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 5.6 to 15.8) and of additional serious adverse events, including pericarditis, arrhythmia, deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, and thrombocytopenia.In this study in a nationwide mass vaccination setting, the BNT162b2 vaccine was not associated with an elevated risk of most of the adverse events examined. The vaccine was associated with an excess risk of myocarditis (1 to 5 events per 100,000 persons). The risk of this potentially serious adverse event and of many other serious adverse events was substantially increased after SARS-CoV-2 infection. (Funded by the Ivan and Francesca Berkowitz Family Living Laboratory Collaboration at Harvard Medical School and Clalit Research Institute.).Preapproval trials showed that messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had a good safety profile, yet these trials were subject to size and patient-mix limitations. An evaluation of the safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine with respect to a broad range of potential adverse events is needed.","424":"Increased FHS coverage would be expected to reduce inequalities in mortality among cities (from 2.8 to 2.4 deaths per 1000 between the highest-mortality and lowest-mortality city, given a 40\u2009percentage point increase in coverage), between welfare recipients and non-recipients (from 1.3 to 1.0 deaths per 1,000), and among race\/ethnic groups (between Black and White Brazilians from 1.0 to 0.8 deaths per 1,000). Even a 40\u2009percentage point increase in coverage, however, would be insufficient to reach SDG targets alone, as it would be expected to reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by 20% (vs the target of 33%), and communicable diseases by 15% (vs 100%).15 largest cities by population size in Brazil.Microsimulation model.As middle-income countries strive to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it remains unclear to what degree expanding primary care coverage can help achieve those goals and reduce within-country inequalities in mortality. Our objective was to estimate the potential impact of primary care expansion on cause-specific mortality in the 15 largest Brazilian cities.Crude and age-standardised mortality by cause, infant mortality and under-5 mortality.We performed survival analysis to estimate HRs of death by cause and by demographic group, from a national administrative database linked to the Estrat\u00e9gia de Sa\u00fade da Fam\u00edlia (Family Health Strategy, FHS) electronic health and death records among 1.2\u2009million residents of Rio de Janeiro (2010-2016). We incorporated the HRs into a microsimulation to estimate the impact of changing primary care coverage in the 15 largest cities by population size in Brazil.Simulated populations.FHS primary care coverage may be critically beneficial to reducing within-country health inequalities, but reaching SDG targets will likely require coordination between primary care and other sectors.","425":"A dramatic resurgence of malaria in Tororo was temporally associated with a change to clothianidin-based IRS formulations and emergence of An. funestus as the predominant vector. Malaria decreased after a shift back to IRS with Actellic. This study highlights the ability of malaria vectors to rapidly circumvent control efforts and the importance of high-quality surveillance systems to assess the impact of malaria control interventions and generate timely, actionable data.At Nagongera Health Center average monthly malaria cases varied from 419 prior to implementation of IRS; to 56 after 5 years of IRS with Bendiocarb and Actellic; to 1591 after the change in IRS to Fludora Fusion\/SumiShield; to 155 after a change back to Actellic. Among cohort participants living away from the border in Tororo, malaria incidence increased over 8-fold (0.36 vs. 2.97 episodes per person year, p<0.0001) and parasite prevalence increased over 4-fold (17% vs. 70%, p<0.0001) from 2021 to 2022 when Fludora Fusion\/SumiShield was used. Incidence decreased almost 5-fold (2.97 vs. 0.70, p<0.0001) and prevalence decreased by 39% (70% vs. 43%, p<0.0001) after shifting back to Actellic. There was a similar pattern among those living near the border in Tororo, with increased incidence between 2021 and 2022 (0.93 vs. 2.40, p<0.0001) followed by a decrease after the change to Actellic (2.40 vs. 1.33, p<0.001). Among residents of Busia, malaria incidence did not change significantly over the 3 years of observation. Malaria resurgence in Tororo was temporally correlated with the replacement of An. gambiae s.s. by An. funestus as the primary vector, with a marked decrease in the density of An. funestus following the shift back to IRS with Actellic. In Busia, An. gambiae s.s. remained the primary vector throughout the observation period. Sporozoite rates were approximately 50% higher among An. funestus compared to the other common malaria vectors. Insecticide resistance phenotyping of An. funestus revealed high tolerance to clothianidin, but full susceptibility to Actellic.Tororo District, Uganda experienced a dramatic decrease in malaria burden from 2015-19 following 5 years of indoor residual spraying (IRS) with carbamate (Bendiocarb) and then organophosphate (Actellic) insecticides. However, a marked resurgence occurred in 2020, which coincided with a change to a clothianidin-based IRS formulations (Fludora Fusion\/SumiShield). To quantify the magnitude of the resurgence, investigate causes, and evaluate the impact of a shift back to IRS with Actellic in 2023, we assessed changes in malaria metrics in regions within and near Tororo District.Malaria surveillance data from Nagongera Health Center, Tororo District was included from 2011-2023. In addition, a cohort of 667 residents from 84 houses was followed from August 2020 through September 2023 from an area bordering Tororo and neighboring Busia District, where IRS has never been implemented. Cohort participants underwent passive surveillance for clinical malaria and active surveillance for parasitemia every 28 days. Mosquitoes were collected in cohort households every 2 weeks using CDC light traps. Female Anopheles were speciated and tested for sporozoites and phenotypic insecticide resistance. Temporal comparisons of malaria metrics were stratified by geographic regions.","426":"The pandemic of COVID-19 has imposed tremendous pressure on public health systems and social economic ecosystems over the past years. To alleviate its social impact, it is important to proactively track the prevalence of COVID-19 within communities. The traditional way to estimate the disease prevalence is to estimate from reported clinical test data or surveys. However, the coverage of clinical tests is often limited and the tests can be labor-intensive, requires reliable and timely results, and consistent diagnostic and reporting criteria. Recent studies revealed that patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19 often undergo fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 virus into wastewater, which makes wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for COVID-19 surveillance a promising approach to complement traditional clinical testing. In this paper, we survey the existing literature regarding WBE for COVID-19 surveillance and summarize the current advances in the area. Specifically, we have covered the key aspects of wastewater sampling, sample testing, and presented a comprehensive and organized summary of wastewater data analytical methods. Finally, we provide the open challenges on current wastewater-based COVID-19 surveillance studies, aiming to encourage new ideas to advance the development of effective wastewater-based surveillance systems for general infectious diseases.","427":"Climate-sensitive infectious disease modelling is crucial for public health planning and is underpinned by a complex network of software tools. We identified only 37 tools that incorporated both climate inputs and epidemiological information to produce an output of disease risk in one package, were transparently described and validated, were named (for future searching and versioning), and were accessible (ie, the code was published during the past 10 years or was available on a repository, web platform, or other user interface). We noted disproportionate representation of developers based at North American and European institutions. Most tools (n=30 [81%]) focused on vector-borne diseases, and more than half (n=16 [53%]) of these tools focused on malaria. Few tools (n=4 [11%]) focused on food-borne, respiratory, or water-borne diseases. The under-representation of tools for estimating outbreaks of directly transmitted diseases represents a major knowledge gap. Just over half (n=20 [54%]) of the tools assessed were described as operationalised, with many freely available online.","428":"Administration of these interventions could be cost-effective if they are suitably priced. Suitably-timed seasonal administration could be more cost-effective than their year-round counterpart. Our results can inform the optimal strategy once these preventive interventions are commercially available.With a willingness-to-pay threshold of one national GDP per capita per QALY gained for all the cities, TSC of year-round strategies was: (i) US$2.4 (95% CI: 1.9-3.4) to US$14.7 (11.6-21.4) for MI; (ii) US$19.9 (16.9-25.9) to US$144.2 (124.6-184.7) for IA; (iii) US$28.7 (22.0-42.0) to US$201.0 (156.5-298.6) for PI; (iv) US$31.1 (24.0-45.5) to US$220.7 (172.0-327.3) for maternal plus paediatric immunisation (MPI); and (v) US$41.3 (32.6-58.9) to US$306.2 (244.1-441.3) for infant mAb plus paediatric immunisation (AP). In all cities, the top ten seasonal strategies (ranked by TSC) protected infants from 5 or fewer monthly birth cohorts.New monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and vaccines against RSV with promising efficacy and protection duration are expected to be available in the near future. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the administration of maternal immunisation (MI), infant mAb (IA) and paediatric immunisation (PI) as well as their combinations in eight Chinese cities.We used a static model to estimate the impact of these preventive interventions on reducing the burden of RSV-ALRI in twelve monthly birth cohorts from a societal perspective. In addition to year-round administration, we also considered seasonal administration of MI and IA (i.e., administered only to children born in selected months). The primary outcome was threshold strategy cost (TSC), defined as the maximum costs per child for a strategy to be cost-effective.","429":"Little monitoring has been conducted of temperature and humidity inside homes despite the fact that these conditions may be relevant to health outcomes. Previous studies have observed associations between self-reported perceptions of the indoor environment and health. Here, we investigate associations between measured temperature and humidity, perceptions of indoor environmental conditions, and health symptoms in a sample of New York City apartments. We measured temperature and humidity in 40 New York City apartments during summer and winter seasons and collected survey data from the households' residents. Health outcomes of interest were (1) sleep quality, (2) symptoms of heat illness (summer season), and (3) symptoms of respiratory viral infection (winter season). Using mixed-effects logistic regression models, we investigated associations between the perceptions, symptoms, and measured conditions in each season. Perceptions of indoor temperature were significantly associated with measured temperature in both the summer and the winter, with a stronger association in the summer season. Sleep quality was inversely related to measured and perceived indoor temperature in the summer season only. Heat illness symptoms were associated with perceived, but not measured, temperature in the summer season. We did not find an association between any measured or perceived condition and cases of respiratory infection in the winter season. Although limited in size, the results of this study reveal that indoor temperature may impact sleep quality, and that thermal perceptions of the indoor environment may indicate vulnerability to heat illness. These are both important avenues for further investigation.","430":"Rabies, a re-emerging zoonosis with the highest known human case fatality rate, has been largely absent from Peru, except for endemic circulation in the Puno region on the Bolivian border and re-emergence in Arequipa City in 2015, where it has persisted. In 2021, an outbreak occurred in the rapidly expanding city of El Pedregal near Arequipa, followed by more cases in 2022 after nearly a year of epidemiological silence. While currently under control, questions persist regarding the origin of the El Pedregal outbreak and implications for maintaining rabies control in Peru.Phylogenomic analysis identified two genetic clusters in El Pedregal: 2021 cases stemmed from a single introduction unrelated to Arequipa cases, while the 2022 sequence suggested a new introduction from Arequipa rather than persistence. In relation to canine RABV diversity in Latin America, all new sequences belonged to a new minor clade, Cosmopolitan Am5, sharing relatives from Bolivia, Argentina, and Brazil.We sequenced 25 dog rabies virus (RABV) genomes from the El Pedregal outbreak (n=11) and Arequipa City (n=14) from 2021-2023 using Nanopore sequencing in Peru. Historical genomes from Puno (n=4, 2010-2012) and Arequipa (n=5, 2015-2019), were sequenced using an Illumina approach in the UK. In total, 34 RABV genomes were analyzed, including archived and newly obtained samples. The genomes were analyzed phylogenetically to understand the outbreak's context and origins.Genomic insights into the El Pedregal outbreak revealed multiple introductions over a 2-year window. Eco-epidemiological conditions, including migratory worker patterns, suggest human-mediated movement drove introductions. Despite outbreak containment, El Pedregal remains at risk of dog-mediated rabies due to ongoing circulation in Arequipa, Puno, and Bolivia. Human-mediated movement of dogs presents a major risk for rabies re-emergence in Peru, jeopardizing regional dog-mediated rabies control. Additional sequence data is needed for comprehensive phylogenetic analyses.","431":"Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; Wellcome Trust.The outbreak parasite populations were characterised by unprecedented loss of genetic diversity, primarily caused by rapid clonal expansion of a multidrug-resistant strain (LAA1) carrying the kelch13 Arg539Thr (R539T) mutation. LAA1 replaced kelch13 Cys580Tyr (C580Y) mutants resistant to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (KEL1\/PLA1) as the dominant strain. LAA1 inherited 58\u00b78% of its genome from a strain circulating in Cambodia in 2008. A secondary outbreak strain (LAA2) carried the kelch13 C580Y allele, and a genome that is essentially identical to a Cambodian parasite from 2009. A third, low-frequency strain (LAA7) was a recombinant of KEL1\/PLA1 with a kelch13 R539T mutant.These results strongly suggest that the outbreak was driven by a selective sweep, possibly associated with multidrug-resistant phenotypes of the outbreak strains. Established resistant populations can circulate at low frequencies for years before suddenly overwhelming dominant strains when the conditions for selection become favourable-eg, when front-line therapies change. Genetic surveillance can support elimination by characterising key properties of outbreaks such as population diversity, drug resistance marker prevalence, and the origins of outbreak strains.In this genetic analysis, 2164 P falciparum dried blood spot samples were collected from southern Laos between Jan 1, 2017, and April 1, 2021, which included 249 collected during the Attapeu outbreak between April 1, 2020, and April 1, 2021, by routine surveillance. Genetic barcodes obtained from these samples were used to investigate epidemiological changes underpinning the outbreak, estimate population diversity, and analyse population structure. Whole-genome sequencing data from additional historical samples were used to reconstruct the ancestry of outbreak strains using identity-by-descent analyses.Malaria outbreaks are important public health concerns that can cause resurgence in endemic regions approaching elimination. We investigated a Plasmodium falciparum outbreak in Attapeu Province, Laos, during the 2020-21 malaria season, using genomic epidemiology methods to elucidate parasite population dynamics and identify its causes.For the Lao translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.","432":"High-functioning communicable disease surveillance systems are critical for public health preparedness. Countries that cannot quickly detect and contain diseases are a risk to the global community. The ability of all countries to comply with the International Health Regulations is paramount for global health security. Zoonotic diseases can be particularly dangerous for humans. We conducted a surveillance system assessment of institutional and individual capacity in Kinshasa and Haut Katanga provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for nationally identified priority zoonotic diseases (eg, viral hemorrhagic fever [VHF], yellow fever, rabies, monkeypox, and influenza monitored through acute respiratory infections). Data were collected from 79 health workers responsible for disease surveillance at 2 provincial health offices, 9 health zone offices, 9 general reference hospitals, and 18 health centers and communities. A set of questionnaires was used to assess health worker training in disease surveillance methods; knowledge of case definitions; availability of materials and tools to support timely case detection, reporting, and data interpretation; timeliness and completeness of reporting; and supervision from health authorities. We found that health workers either had not been recently or ever trained in surveillance methods and that their knowledge of case definitions was low. Timeliness and completeness of weekly notification of epidemic-prone diseases was generally well performed, but the lack of available standardized reporting forms and archive of completed forms affected the quality of data collected. Lessons learned from our assessment can be used for targeted strengthening efforts to improve global health security.","433":"Clavanin A (ClavA) is an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) whose antimicrobial activity is enhanced in the presence of Zn(II) ions. The antimicrobial activity of ClavA has been shown to increase 16-fold in the presence of Zn(II) ions. In this study, we investigate the potential sources of this enhancement, namely, the effect of Zn(II) binding on the helical conformation of ClavA and on the ClavA interaction with a model for gram-negative bacterial membranes. In addition, we investigate the effect of Zn(II) on the membrane mechanical properties. We employed all-atom equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations initiated from both fully helical and random coil structures of ClavA. We observe that Zn(II) can stabilize an existing helical conformation in the Zn(II)-binding region, but we do not observe induction of helical conformations in systems initiated in random coil configurations. Zn(II) binding to ClavA provides more favorable electrostatics for membrane association in the C-terminal region. This is evidenced by longer and stronger C-terminal-lipid interactions. Zn(II) is also capable of modulating the membrane properties in a manner which favors ClavA insertion and the potential for enhanced translocation into the cell. This work provides insights into the role of divalent metal cations in the antimicrobial activity of ClavA. This information can be used for the development of synthetic AMPs containing motifs that can bind metals (metalloAMPs) for therapeutic and medical purposes.","434":" levels.

Vector control avoided 60% of potential infections. According to our results, it is likely that further ZIKV outbreaks identified in other areas of Miami-Dade County were seeded by commuters to Wynwood rather than by additional importation from international travellers. Our study can help prepare future outbreak-related interventions in European areas where competent mosquitoes for ZIKV transmission are already established.","436":"The potential benefits and dangers of dietary protein restriction in chronic kidney disease (CKD) are still controversial. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of low protein diet (LPD) on the renal function in nondialysis CKD patients. A retrospective study was conducted from 321 nondialysis CKD patient's medical files (65.1\u2009\u00b1\u200912.7 yrs, 58.2% men). These patients received individualized dietary protein prescription (0.6-0.8\u2009g protein\/kg\/day). Protein intake was evaluated by food diary and 24\u2009h-food recall. Adherence to the LPD was considered when patients intake from 90 to 110% of the prescribed amount of protein. The patients were divided into 4 groups: (G1) adherent diabetes mellitus (DM) patients (n\u2009=\u200983); (G2) non-adherent DM patients (n\u2009=\u2009106); (G3) adherent non-DM patients (n\u2009=\u200975); (G4) non-adherent non-DM patients (n\u2009=\u200957). Renal function was assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Both groups of patients (DM and non-DM) that adhered to the LPD showed significant improvement in eGFR (G1: 38.7\u2009\u00b1\u200913.2\u2009mL\/min to 51.1\u2009\u00b1\u200917.0\u2009mL\/min (p\u2009<\u20090.001); G3: 35.1\u2009\u00b1\u200916.8\u2009mL\/min to 46.8\u2009\u00b1\u200921.4\u2009mL\/min (p\u2009<\u20090.001)). In adherent patients, no differences in albumin and BMI were observed at the end of follow up. In non-adherent patients, eGFR significantly decreased in DM group (G2: 44.2\u2009\u00b1\u200918.5\u2009mL\/min to 38.2\u2009\u00b1\u200915.8\u2009mL\/min (p\u2009=\u20090.003)). According to multivariate analysis, annual changes in eGFR were not independent associated with age, gender, BMI, lipid profile, bicarbonate or smoking status. In summary, adherence to low protein diet could be able to improve serum creatinine and eGFR, well-known markers of renal function. However, prospective studies are needed to control confounders which affect renal function and CKD progression.","437":"Overdose deaths across the country have spiked since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is crucial now, more than ever, to address the continuing and worsening, complex and dynamic opioid and overdose epidemics. In 2018, The Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) on Opioids and Overdose, based at Rhode Island Hospital, launched with three major goals: 1) establish a center of scientific excellence on opioids and overdose; 2) train the next generation of scientists to become independent investigators and address the opioid and overdose crises; and 3) contribute to the scientific progress and solutions to combat these epidemics. To date, we have made substantial progress. While the opioid and overdose crises continue to evolve, the COBRE on Opioid and Overdose and its team of investigators are well poised to address the daunting task of understanding and meaningfully addressing these deadly epidemics, with the ultimate goal of saving lives.","438":"Cascades are an accepted model to capturing how information diffuses across social network platforms. A large body of research has been focused on dissecting the anatomy of such cascades and forecasting their progression. One recurring theme involves predicting the next stage(s) of cascades utilizing pertinent information such as the underlying social network, structural properties of nodes (e.g., degree) and (partial) histories of cascade propagation. However, such type of granular information is rarely available in practice. We study in this paper the problem of cascade prediction utilizing only two types of (coarse) information, viz. which node is infected and its corresponding infection time. We first construct several simple baselines to solve this cascade prediction problem. Then we describe the shortcomings of these methods and propose a new solution leveraging recent progress in embeddings and attention models from representation learning. We also perform an exhaustive analysis of our methods on several real world datasets. Our proposed model outperforms the baselines and several other state-of-the-art methods.","439":"The steady growth of digitized historical information is continuously stimulating new different approaches to the fields of Digital Humanities and Computational Social Science. In this work we use Natural Language Processing techniques to retrieve large amounts of historical information from Wikipedia. In particular, the pages of a set of historically notable individuals are processed to catch the locations and the date of people\u2019s movements. This information is then structured in a geographical network of mobility patterns.\r\n\r\nWe analyze the mobility of historically notable individuals from different perspectives to better understand the role of migrations and international collaborations in the context of innovation and cultural development. In this work, we first present some general characteristics of the dataset from a social and geographical perspective. Then, we build a spatial network of cities, and we model and quantify the tendency to explore of a set of people that can be considered as historically and culturally notable. In this framework, we show that by using a multilevel radiation model for human mobility, we are able to catch important features of migration\u2019s behavior. Results show that the choice of the target migration place for historically and culturally relevant people is limited to a small number of locations and that it depends on the discipline a notable is interested in and on the number of opportunities she\/he can find there.","440":"We used baseline data from the UK-REACH cohort study collected December 2020-March 2021. We used multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for demographic, occupational and lifestyle factors to examine the relationship between self-reported LTCs\/MLTCs and ethnicity, migration status and time since migration to the UK.Of 12,100 included HCWs, with a median age of 45 years (IQR: 34-54), 27% were overseas-born, and 30% were from non-White ethnic groups (19% Asian, 4% Black, 4% Mixed, 2% Other). The most common self-reported LTCs were anxiety (14.9%), asthma (12.2%), depression (10.7%), hypertension (8.7%) and diabetes (4.0%). Mental health conditions were more prevalent among UK-born than overseas-born HCWs for all ethnic groups (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) using White UK-born as the reference group each time: White overseas-born 0.77, 95%CI 0.66-0.95 for anxiety). Diabetes and hypertension were more common among Asian (e.g. Asian overseas, diabetes aOR 2.97, 95%CI 2.30-3.83) and Black (e.g. Black UK-born, hypertension aOR 1.77, 95%CI 1.05-2.99) groups than White UK-born. After adjustment for age, sex and deprivation, the odds of reporting MLTCs were lower in most ethnic minority groups and lowest for those born overseas, compared to White UK-born (e.g. White overseas-born, aOR 0.68, 95%CI 0.55-0.83; Asian overseas-born aOR 0.75, 95%CI 0.62-0.90; Black overseas-born aOR 0.52, 95%CI 0.36-0.74). The odds of MLTCs in overseas-born HCWs were equivalent to the UK-born population in those who had settled in the UK for \u2265 20 years (aOR 1.14, 95%CI 0.94-1.37).Healthcare workers' (HCW) well-being has a direct effect on patient care. However, little is known about the prevalence and patterns of long-term medical conditions in HCWs, especially those from ethnic minorities. This study evaluated the burden of multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs), i.e. the presence of two or more single long-term conditions (LTCs), among HCWs in the United Kingdom (UK) and variation by ethnicity and migration status.Among UK HCWs, the prevalence of common LTCs and odds of reporting MLTCs varied by ethnicity and migrant status. The lower odds of MLTCs in migrant HCWs reverted to the odds of MLTCs in UK-born HCWs over time. Further research on this population should include longitudinal studies with linkage to healthcare records. Interventions should be co-developed with HCWs from different ethnic and migrant groups focussed upon patterns of conditions prevalent in specific HCW subgroups to reduce the overall burden of LTCs\/MLTCs.","441":"Both genetic variation and certain culturally transmitted phenotypes show geographic signatures of human demographic history. As a result of the human cultural predisposition to migrate to new areas, humans have adapted to a large number of different environments. Migration to new environments alters genetic selection pressures, and comparative genetic studies have pinpointed numerous likely targets of this selection. However, humans also exhibit many cultural adaptations to new environments, such as practices related to clothing, shelter, and food. Human culture interacts with genes and the environment in complex ways, and studying genes and culture together can deepen our understanding of human evolution.","442":"The probability of detecting resistant gram-negative organisms, including Enterobacterales, Acinetobacter spp, and Pseudomonas spp, increased with distance from the patient. In contrast, Clostridioides difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were more likely to be detected close to the patient. Resistant Pseudomonas spp and S. aureus were enriched in these hot spots despite broad deposition of 16S rRNA gene sequences assigned to the same genera, suggesting modifiable factors that permit the persistence of these MDROs.MDRO hot spots can be defined by distance from the patient and from wastewater reservoirs. Evaluating how MDROs are enriched relative to bacterial DNA deposition helps to identify healthcare micro-environments and suggests how targeted environmental cleaning or design approaches could prevent MDRO persistence and reduce infection risk.Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) colonizing the healthcare environment have been shown to contribute to risk for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), with adverse effects on patient morbidity and mortality. We sought to determine how bacterial contamination and persistent MDRO colonization of the healthcare environment are related to the position of patients and wastewater sites.We performed a prospective cohort study, enrolling 51 hospital rooms at the time of admitting a patient with an eligible MDRO in the prior 30 days. We performed systematic sampling and MDRO culture of rooms, as well as 16S rRNA sequencing to define the environmental microbiome in a subset of samples.","443":"Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming many domains, including finance, agriculture, defense, and biomedicine. In this paper, we focus on the role of AI in clinical and translational research (CTR), including preclinical research (T1), clinical research (T2), clinical implementation (T3), and public (or population) health (T4). Given the rapid evolution of AI in CTR, we present three complementary perspectives: (1) scoping literature review, (2) survey, and (3) analysis of federally funded projects. For each CTR phase, we addressed challenges, successes, failures, and opportunities for AI. We surveyed Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) hubs regarding AI projects at their institutions. Nineteen of 63 CTSA hubs (30%) responded to the survey. The most common funding source (48.5%) was the federal government. The most common translational phase was T2 (clinical research, 40.2%). Clinicians were the intended users in 44.6% of projects and researchers in 32.3% of projects. The most common computational approaches were supervised machine learning (38.6%) and deep learning (34.2%). The number of projects steadily increased from 2012 to 2020. Finally, we analyzed 2604 AI projects at CTSA hubs using the National Institutes of Health Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORTER) database for 2011-2019. We mapped available abstracts to medical subject headings and found that nervous system (16.3%) and mental disorders (16.2) were the most common topics addressed. From a computational perspective, big data (32.3%) and deep learning (30.0%) were most common. This work represents a snapshot in time of the role of AI in the CTSA program.","444":"Although microbes have been evolving resistance to antimicrobials for millennia, the spread of resistance in pathogen populations calls for the development of new drugs and treatment strategies. We propose that successful, long-term resistance management requires a better understanding of how resistance evolves in the first place. This is an opportunity for evolutionary biologists to engage in public health, a collaboration that has substantial precedent. Resistance evolution has been an important tool for developing and testing evolutionary theory, especially theory related to the genetic basis of new traits and constraints on adaptation. The present era is no exception. The articles in this issue highlight the breadth of current research on resistance evolution and also its challenges. In this introduction, we review the conceptual advances that have been achieved from studying resistance evolution and describe a path forward. ","445":"RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with Ct values stratified by age and symptoms.Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from participant-collected samples.In this community-based cross-sectional study, SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels, as determined by Ct values, were significantly higher in symptomatic individuals than in asymptomatic individuals and no significant age-related differences were found. Further research is needed to understand the role of SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels and viral transmission.The association between COVID-19 symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 viral levels in children living in the community is not well understood.This cross-sectional study used a respiratory virus surveillance platform in persons of all ages to detect community COVID-19 cases from March 23 to November 9, 2020. A population-based convenience sample of children younger than 18 years and adults in King County, Washington, who enrolled online for home self-collection of upper respiratory samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing were included.To characterize symptoms of pediatric COVID-19 in the community and analyze the association between symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels, as approximated by cycle threshold (Ct) values, in children and adults.Among 555 SARS-CoV-2-positive participants (mean [SD] age, 33.7 [20.1] years; 320 were female [57.7%]), 47 of 123 children (38.2%) were asymptomatic compared with 31 of 432 adults (7.2%). When symptomatic, fewer symptoms were reported in children compared with adults (mean [SD], 1.6 [2.0] vs 4.5 [3.1]). Symptomatic individuals had lower Ct values (which corresponded to higher viral RNA levels) than asymptomatic individuals (adjusted estimate for children, -3.0; 95% CI, -5.5 to -0.6; P\u2009=\u2009.02; adjusted estimate for adults, -2.9; 95% CI, -5.2 to -0.6; P\u2009=\u2009.01). The difference in mean Ct values was neither statistically significant between symptomatic children and symptomatic adults (adjusted estimate, -0.7; 95% CI, -2.2 to 0.9; P\u2009=\u2009.41) nor between asymptomatic children and asymptomatic adults (adjusted estimate, -0.6; 95% CI, -4.0 to 2.8; P\u2009=\u2009.74).","446":"The analyses show that vertical transmission and infectious reactivation are the main drivers of transmission. Vaccination strategies aimed at reducing transmission from mother to child (vaccinating pregnant women or women of reproductive age) can yield substantial reductions of cCMV in 20 years (31.7-71.4% if 70% of women are effectively vaccinated). Alternatively, hygiene intervention aimed at preventing CMV infection and re-infection of women of reproductive age from young children is expected to reduce cCMV by less than 2%. The effects of large-scale vaccination on CMV prevalence can be substantial, owing to the moderate transmissibility of CMV at the population level. However, as CMV causes lifelong infection, the timescale on which reductions in CMV prevalence are expected is in the order of several decades. Elimination of CMV infection in the long run is only feasible for a vaccine with a long duration of protection and high vaccination coverage.We evaluated the impact of vaccination strategies and hygiene intervention using transmission models. Model parameters were estimated from a cross-sectional serological population study (n=5179) and a retrospective birth cohort (n=31,484), providing information on the age- and sex-specific CMV prevalence and on the birth prevalence of congenital CMV (cCMV).Infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) is highly prevalent worldwide and can cause severe disease in immunocompromised persons and congenitally infected infants. The disease burden caused by congenital CMV infection is high, especially in resource-limited countries. Vaccines are currently under development for various target groups.Vaccination is an effective intervention to reduce the birth prevalence of cCMV. Population-level reductions in CMV prevalence can only be achieved on a long timescale. Our results stress the value of vaccinating pregnant women and women of childbearing age and provide support for the development of CMV vaccines and early planning of vaccination scenarios and rollouts.","447":"In this paper, we developed an age-structured epidemic model that takes into account boosting and waning of immune status of host individuals. For many infectious diseases, the immunity of recovered individuals may be waning as time evolves, so reinfection could occur, but also their immune status could be boosted if they have contact with infective agent. According to the idea of the Aron's malaria model, we incorporate a boosting mechanism expressed by reset of recovery-age (immunity clock) into the SIRS epidemic model. We established the mathematical well-posedness of our formulation and showed that the initial invasion condition and the endemicity can be characterized by the basic reproduction number $ R_0 $. Our focus is to investigate the condition to determine the direction of bifurcation of endemic steady states bifurcated from the disease-free steady state, because it is a crucial point for disease prevention strategy whether there exist subcritical endemic steady states. Based on a recent result by Martcheva and Inaba [1], we have determined the direction of bifurcation that endemic steady states bifurcate from the disease-free steady state when the basic reproduction number passes through the unity. Finally, we have given a necessary and sufficient condition for backward bifurcation to occur.","448":"The enzyme phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6) is a critical component of the visual signaling pathway and functions to convert cGMP to GMP. The ability of PDE6 to affect cellular cGMP levels leads to deactivation of cGMP-gated ion channels in both rod and cone cells. PDE6 has been difficult to structurally characterize experimentally, though the structures of the closely related PDE5 and a PDE5\/6 chimera have been determined by X-ray crystallography. In this work, we employ a computational approach to study the dynamics of the catalytic domains of PDE6, PDE5, and the PDE5\/6 chimera. Through equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identify a region of PDE6 (\u03b112) to be correlated to distal regions of the enzyme (H- and M-loops), which surround the catalytic center. These correlations are not observed for PDE5, and we speculate that these unique motions in PDE6 may relate to the high catalytic efficiency of PDE6 and the requirement for an endogenous inhibitory subunit (P\u03b3). We further investigate the ligand binding pathways and energetics by enhanced sampling simulations (metadynamics) using the inhibitor sildenafil and GMP. The energetics and pathways of ligand binding are consistent with the high efficiency of PDE6 and further implicate the \u03b112 region as an important regulatory element for PDE6 functional dynamics.","449":"Buruli ulcer, caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is highly endemic in West Africa. While the mode of transmission is unknown, many studies associate Buruli ulcer with different types of water exposure. We present results from the largest study to date to test for M. ulcerans in aquatic sites and identify environmental attributes associated with its presence. Environmental samples from 98 aquatic sites in the Greater Accra, Ashanti, and Volta regions of Ghana were tested for the presence of M. ulcerans DNA by polymerase chain reaction. The proportion of aquatic sites positive for M. ulcerans varied by region: Ashanti 66% (N = 39), Greater Accra 34% (N = 29), and Volta 0% (N = 30). We explored the spatial distribution of M. ulcerans positive and negative water bodies and found no significant clusters. We also determined both highly localized water attributes and broad scale remotely sensed land cover and terrain environmental characteristics associated with M. ulcerans presence through logistic regression. Our results concur with published results regarding conditions suitable for M. ulcerans growth and associations with Buruli ulcer disease burden with regards to water characteristics and disturbed environments, but differ from others with regards to spatial associations and topographic effects such as elevation and wetness. While our results suggest M. ulcerans is an environmental organism existing in a specific ecological niche, they also reveal variation in the elements defining this niche across the sites considered. In addition, despite the causal association between Buruli ulcer and M. ulcerans, we observed no significant statistical association between case reports of Buruli ulcer and presence of M. ulcerans in nearby waterbodies.","450":"Using the statistic, we developed an algorithm of linear time and space complexity for detecting most types of repetitive sequences in multiple scenarios, including finding candidate clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats regions from bacterial genomic or metagenomics sequences. Simulation and real data experiments show that the method works well on both assembled sequences and unassembled short reads.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.The codes are available at https:\/\/github.com\/XuegongLab\/D2R_codes under GPL 3.0 license.Detecting sequences containing repetitive regions is a basic bioinformatics task with many applications. Several methods have been developed for various types of repeat detection tasks. An efficient generic method for detecting most types of repetitive sequences is still desirable. Inspired by the excellent properties and successful applications of the D2 family of statistics in comparative analyses of genomic sequences, we developed a new statistic D2R that can efficiently discriminate sequences with or without repetitive regions.","451":"-statistic has been suggested to compare two sequences. However, it is not known how to best choose the word length k in such studies.Our studies provide guidelines on choosing the optimal word length for the comparison of Markov sequences.)+1 for both long sequences and next generation sequencing (NGS) read data. The orders of the Markov chains may be unknown and several methods have been developed to estimate the orders of Markov chains based on both long sequences and NGS reads. We study the power loss of the statistics when the estimated orders are used. It is shown that the power loss is minimal for some of the estimators of the orders of Markov chains.","452":"The COVID-19 pandemic is unlikely to end until there is global roll-out of vaccines that protect against severe disease and preferably drive herd immunity. Regulators in numerous countries have authorised or approved COVID-19 vaccines for human use, with more expected to be licensed in 2021. Yet having licensed vaccines is not enough to achieve global control of COVID-19: they also need to be produced at scale, priced affordably, allocated globally so that they are available where needed, and widely deployed in local communities. In this Health Policy paper, we review potential challenges to success in each of these dimensions and discuss policy implications. To guide our review, we developed a dashboard to highlight key characteristics of 26 leading vaccine candidates, including efficacy levels, dosing regimens, storage requirements, prices, production capacities in 2021, and stocks reserved for low-income and middle-income countries. We use a traffic-light system to signal the potential contributions of each candidate to achieving global vaccine immunity, highlighting important trade-offs that policy makers need to consider when developing and implementing vaccination programmes. Although specific datapoints are subject to change as the pandemic response progresses, the dashboard will continue to provide a useful lens through which to analyse the key issues affecting the use of COVID-19 vaccines. We also present original data from a 32-country survey (n=26\u2008758) on potential acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, conducted from October to December, 2020. Vaccine acceptance was highest in Vietnam (98%), India (91%), China (91%), Denmark (87%), and South Korea (87%), and lowest in Serbia (38%), Croatia (41%), France (44%), Lebanon (44%), and Paraguay (51%).","453":"The charter of the SIP-WG is to investigate options to enhance the long-term sustainability of the OSS being developed by ITCR, in part by developing a collection of business model archetypes that can serve as sustainability plans for ITCR OSS development initiatives. The working group assembled models from the ITCR program, from other studies, and from the engagement of its extensive network of relationships with other organizations (eg, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Open Source Initiative, and Software Sustainability Institute) in support of this objective.We recommend 6 essential attributes for research software: alignment with unmet scientific needs, a dedicated development team, a vibrant user community, a feasible licensing model, a sustainable financial model, and effective product management. We also stress important actions to be considered in future ITCR activities that involve the discussion of the sustainability and licensing models for ITCR OSS, the establishment of a central library, the allocation of consulting resources to code quality control, ecosystem collaboration, security, and dependency hygiene.This paper reviews the existing sustainability models and describes 10 OSS use cases disseminated by the SIP-WG and others, including 3D Slicer, Bioconductor, Cytoscape, Globus, i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside) and tranSMART, Insight Toolkit, Linux, Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics tools, R, and REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), in 10 sustainability aspects: governance, documentation, code quality, support, ecosystem collaboration, security, legal, finance, marketing, and dependency hygiene.The National Cancer Institute Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) program provides a series of funding mechanisms to create an ecosystem of open-source software (OSS) that serves the needs of cancer research. As the ITCR ecosystem substantially grows, it faces the challenge of the long-term sustainability of the software being developed by ITCR grantees. To address this challenge, the ITCR sustainability and industry partnership working group (SIP-WG) was convened in 2019.Information available to the public reveals that all 10 OSS have effective governance, comprehensive documentation, high code quality, reliable dependency hygiene, strong user and developer support, and active marketing. These OSS include a variety of licensing models (eg, general public license version 2, general public license version 3, Berkeley Software Distribution, and Apache 3) and financial models (eg, federal research funding, industry and membership support, and commercial support). However, detailed information on ecosystem collaboration and security is not publicly provided by most OSS.","454":"We propose here changes to the U.S. government policy on potential pandemic pathogen (PPP) oversight and implementation, emphasizing transparency of the review process and the content of the review, publication of the review in advance, responsible publication of enhanced PPP research, high-level signoff on approvals of enhanced PPP experiments, and the need for a significant effort to establish a common international approach to enhanced PPP work. We advocate that the U.S. government recommend, and non-U.S. government funders and journals adopt, a set of best practices that would extend important considerations of biosafety and biosecurity to all work on enhanced potential pandemic pathogens regardless of funding source.","455":"Viral load (VL) testing is recommended for monitoring people on ART. The National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) in South Africa conducts >5million laboratory-based VL tests but faces challenges with specimen integrity and results delivery. Point-of-care (POC) VL monitoring may improve VL suppression (VLS). We assessed the cost-effectiveness of different strategies for POC testing in South Africa.Assuming POC VL monitoring confers clinical benefits, the most cost-effective strategy for POC adoption in South Africa is a targeted approach with POC VL technologies placed at facilities with high level of viral failure.Funding support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.Existing laboratory-based VL testing costs $126\u202fm annually and achieves 85.2% VLS. Strategy 2 was the most cost-effective approach, with 88.5% VLS and $40\/additional person suppressed, compared to the status-quo. Should resources allow, complete POC adoption may be cost-effective (ICER: $136\/additional person suppressed), requiring an additional $49\u202fm annually and achieving 94.5% VLS. All other strategies were dominated in the incremental analysis.We developed a cost-outcome model utilizing NHLS data, including facility-level annual VL volumes, proportion with VLS, specimen rejection rates, turn-around-time, and the cost\/test. We assessed the impact of adopting POC VL technology under 4 strategies: (1) status-quo; (2) targeted POC testing at facilities with high levels of viral failure; (3) targeted POC testing at low-performing facilities; (4) complete POC adoption. For each strategy, we determined the total cost, effectiveness (expected number of virally suppressed people) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) based on expected (>10%) VLS improvement.","456":"A synthetic population is a simplified microscopic representation of an actual population. Statistically representative at the population level, it provides valuable inputs to simulation models (especially agent-based models) in research areas such as transportation, land use, economics, and epidemiology. This article describes the datasets from the Synthetic Sweden Mobility (SySMo) model using the state-of-art methodology, including machine learning (ML), iterative proportional fitting (IPF), and probabilistic sampling. The model provides a synthetic replica of over 10 million Swedish individuals (i.e., agents), their household characteristics, and activity-travel plans. This paper briefly explains the methodology for the three datasets: Person, Households, and Activity-travel patterns. Each agent contains socio-demographic attributes, such as age, gender, civil status, residential zone, personal income, car ownership, employment, etc. Each agent also has a household and corresponding attributes such as household size, number of children \u2264 6 years old, etc. These characteristics are the basis for the agents' daily activity-travel schedule, including type of activity, start-end time, duration, sequence, the location of each activity, and the travel mode between activities.","457":"An MS2 bacteriophage was used as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 and was aerosolized using a coughing machine. A simulated HCP wearing a disposable plastic face shield was placed 0.41 m (16 inches) away from the coughing machine. The aerosolized virus was sampled using SKC biosamplers on the inside (near the mouth of the simulated HCP) and the outside of the face shield. The aerosolized virus collected by the SKC Biosampler was analyzed using a viability assay. Optical particle counters (OPCs) were placed next to the biosamplers to measure the particle concentration.Reductions in virus and particle concentrations were observed on the inside of the face shield; however, viable virus was measured on the inside of the face shield, in the breathing zone of the HCP. Therefore, other exposure control methods need to be used to prevent transmission from virus aerosol.Patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) aerosolize severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) via respiratory efforts, expose, and possibly infect healthcare personnel (HCP). To prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 HCP have been required to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) during patient care. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, face shields were used as an approach to control HCP exposure to SARS-CoV-2, including eye protection.There was a statistically significant reduction (P < .0006) in viable virus concentration on the inside of the face shield compared to the outside of the face shield. The particle concentration was significantly lower on the inside of the face shield compared to the outside of the face shield for 12 of the 16 particle sizes measured (P < .05).","458":"Our model assigns each study participant a covariate corresponding to the person's health status. The probabilities of vaccination and of contracting influenza and non-influenza ARI depend on health status. Hence, our model allows non-random vaccination and confounding. In addition, the probability of seeking care for ARI may depend on vaccination and health status. We consider two outcomes of interest: symptomatic influenza (SI) and medically-attended influenza (MAI).If vaccination does not affect the probability of non-influenza ARI, then VE estimates from TN studies usually have smaller bias than estimates from TCC studies. We also found that if vaccinated influenza ARI patients are less likely to seek medical care than unvaccinated patients because the vaccine reduces symptoms' severity, then estimates of VE from both types of studies may be severely biased when the outcome of interest is SI. The bias is not present when the outcome of interest is MAI.As annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all U.S. persons aged 6 months or older, it is unethical to conduct randomized clinical trials to estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE). Observational studies are being increasingly used to estimate VE. We developed a probability model for comparing the bias and the precision of VE estimates from two case-control designs: the traditional case-control (TCC) design and the test-negative (TN) design. In both study designs, acute respiratory illness (ARI) patients seeking medical care testing positive for influenza infection are considered cases. In the TN design, ARI patients seeking medical care who test negative serve as controls, while in the TCC design, controls are randomly selected individuals from the community who did not contract an ARI.The TN design produces valid estimates of VE if (a) vaccination does not affect the probabilities of non-influenza ARI and of seeking care against influenza ARI, and (b) the confounding effects resulting from non-random vaccination are similar for influenza and non-influenza ARI. Since the bias of VE estimates depends on the outcome against which the vaccine is supposed to protect, it is important to specify the outcome of interest when evaluating the bias.","459":"The UK at lower tier local authority (LTLA) level. 310 LTLAs were included in the analysis.To measure the effects of the tier system on the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns, before the emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern.Nationally, transmission increased between July and late September, regional differences notwithstanding. Immediately prior to the introduction of the tier system, Rt averaged 1.3 (0.9-1.6) across LTLAs, but declined to an average of 1.1 (0.86-1.42) 2\u2009weeks later. Decline in transmission was not solely attributable to tiers. Tier 1 had negligible effects. Tiers 2 and 3, respectively, reduced transmission by 6% (5%-7%) and 23% (21%-25%). 288 LTLAs (93%) would have begun to suppress their epidemics if every LTLA had gone into tier 3 by the second national lockdown, whereas only 90 (29%) did so in reality.Reduction in real-time reproduction number Rt .The relatively small effect sizes found in this analysis demonstrate that interventions at least as stringent as tier 3 are required to suppress transmission, especially considering more transmissible variants, at least until effective vaccination is widespread or much greater population immunity has amassed.This is a modelling study combining estimates of real-time reproduction number Rt (derived from UK case, death and serological survey data) with publicly available data on regional non-pharmaceutical interventions. We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model with latent factors using these quantities to account for broader national trends in addition to subnational effects from tiers.","460":"Compared with no intervention, an intervention incorporating tuberculin skin testing and treatment with 3 months of isoniazid and rifapentine would avert 31 (95% uncertainty interval 14-56) lifetime tuberculosis cases and 4\u00b71 (1\u00b74-5\u00b78) lifetime tuberculosis deaths per 1000 individuals, and cost US$242 per DALY averted. All test and regimen combinations were cost-effective compared with no screening. Younger age, longer incarceration, and more recent prison release were each associated with significantly greater health benefits and more favourable cost-effectiveness ratios, although the intervention was cost-effective for all subgroups examined.M tuberculosis infection screening and TPT for individuals who were formerly incarcerated appears cost-effective, and would provide valuable health gains.For the Portuguese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.Individuals who were formerly incarcerated have high tuberculosis incidence, but are generally not considered among the risk groups eligible for tuberculosis prevention. We investigated the potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection screening and tuberculosis preventive treatment (TPT) for individuals who were formerly incarcerated in Brazil.Using published evidence for Brazil, we constructed a Markov state transition model estimating tuberculosis-related health outcomes and costs among individuals who were formerly incarcerated, by simulating transitions between health states over time. The analysis compared tuberculosis infection screening and TPT, to no screening, considering a combination of M tuberculosis infection tests and TPT regimens. We quantified health effects as reductions in tuberculosis cases, tuberculosis deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). We assessed costs from a tuberculosis programme perspective. We report intervention cost-effectiveness as the incremental costs per DALY averted, and tested how results changed across subgroups of the target population.National Institutes of Health.","461":"We obtained physician-level data from QuintilesIMS Xponent\u2122 database for Pennsylvania and constructed county-level measures of time to adoption and share of physicians adopting sitagliptin in its first year post-introduction. We additionally measured total AD drug spending for all Medicare fee-for-service and Part D enrollees (N\u2009=\u2009125,264) and all Medicaid (N\u2009=\u200950,836) enrollees with type II diabetes in Pennsylvania for 2011. Finite mixture model regression, adjusting for patient socio-demographic\/clinical characteristics, was used to examine the association between physician adoption of sitagliptin and AD drug spending.Physician adoption of sitagliptin varied from 44 to 99% across the state's 67 counties. Average per capita AD spending was $1340 (SD $1764) in Medicare and $1291 (SD $1881) in Medicaid. A 10% increase in the share of physicians adopting sitagliptin in a county was associated with a 3.5% (95% CI: 2.0-4.9) and 5.3% (95% CI: 0.3-10.3) increase in drug spending for the Medicare and Medicaid populations, respectively.In the United States, there is well-documented regional variation in prescription drug spending. However, the specific role of physician adoption of brand name drugs on the variation in patient-level prescription drug spending is still being investigated across a multitude of drug classes. Our study aims to add to the literature by determining the association between physician adoption of a first-in-class anti-diabetic (AD) drug, sitagliptin, and AD drug spending in the Medicare and Medicaid populations in Pennsylvania.In a medication market with many choices, county-level adoption of sitagliptin was positively associated with AD spending in Medicare and Medicaid, two programs with different approaches to formulary management.","462":"Preventive and modeling approaches to address the COVID-19 pandemic have been primarily based on the age or occupation, and often disregard the importance of heterogeneity in population contact structure and individual connectivity. To address this gap, we developed models based on Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi and a power law degree distribution that first incorporate the role of heterogeneity and connectivity and then can be expanded to make assumptions about demographic characteristics. Results demonstrate that variations in the number of connections of individuals within a population modify the impact of public health interventions such as lockdown or vaccination approaches. We conclude that the most effective strategy will vary depending on the underlying contact structure of individuals within a population and on timing of the interventions.","463":"Multidrug resistance and fluoroquinolone non-susceptibility (FQNS) are major concerns for the epidemiology and treatment of typhoid fever. The 2018 prequalification of the first typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) by WHO provides an opportunity to limit the transmission and burden of antimicrobial-resistant typhoid fever.The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.We combined output from mathematical models of typhoid transmission with estimates of antimicrobial resistance from meta-analyses to predict the burden of antimicrobial-resistant typhoid fever across 73 lower-income countries eligible for support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. We considered FQNS and multidrug resistance separately. The effect of vaccination was predicted on the basis of forecasts of vaccine coverage. We explored how the potential effect of vaccination on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance varied depending on key model parameters.The introduction of routine immunisation with TCV at age 9 months with a catch-up campaign up to age 15 years was predicted to avert 46-74% of all typhoid fever cases in 73 countries eligible for Gavi support. Vaccination was predicted to reduce the relative prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant typhoid fever by 16% (95% prediction interval [PI] 0-49). TCV introduction with a catch-up campaign was predicted to avert 42\u00b75 million (95% PI 24\u00b78-62\u00b78 million) cases and 506\u2009000 (95% PI 187\u2009000-1\u00b79 million) deaths caused by FQNS typhoid fever, and 21\u00b72 million (95% PI 16\u00b74-26\u00b75 million) cases and 342\u2009000 (95% PI 135\u2009000-1\u00b75 million) deaths from multidrug-resistant typhoid fever over 10 years following introduction.Our results indicate the benefits of prioritising TCV introduction for countries with a high avertable burden of antimicrobial-resistant typhoid fever.","464":"Demonstration of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization for severe illness in addition to milder outpatient illness may strengthen vaccination messaging and improve suboptimal uptake in the U.S. Our objective was to compare patient characteristics and VE between U.S. inpatient and outpatient VE networks.We tested adults \u226518-years with acute respiratory illness (ARI) for influenza within two VE networks, one outpatient- and the other hospital-based, from 2015-2018. We compared age, sex, and chronic high-risk conditions between populations. The test-negative design was used to compare vaccination odds in influenza-positive cases versus influenza-negative controls. We estimated VE using logistic regression adjusting for site, age, sex, race\/ethnicity, peak influenza activity, time-to-testing from symptom-onset, season (overall VE) and underlying conditions. VE differences (\u0394VE) were assessed with 95% confidence intervals (CI) determined through bootstrapping with significance defined as excluding the null.Inpatients and outpatients with ARI represent distinct populations. Despite comparatively poor health status among inpatients, influenza vaccination was effective in preventing hospitalizations associated with influenza.The VE networks enrolled 14,573 (4144 influenza-positive) outpatients and 6769 (1452 influenza-positive) inpatients. Inpatients were older (median 62-years vs. 49-years) and had more high-risk conditions (median 4 vs. 1). Overall influenza VE across seasons was 31% (95%CI:26%-37%) among outpatients and 36% (27%-44%) among inpatients. Strain-specific VE among outpatients versus inpatients was 37% (25%-47%) vs. 53% (37%-64%) against H1N1pdm09, 19% (9%-27%) vs. 23% (8%-35%) against H3N2, and 46% (38%-53%) vs. 46% (31%-58%) against B-viruses. \u0394VE was not significant for any comparison across all sites.","465":" mosquitoes per household, the increasing proportion of asymptomatic infections with advancing age, and the high proportion of infections identified as secondary-type infections by serology. These observations should be confirmed in long-term, parallel prospective cohort studies conducted across regions, which would advantageously permit characterization of baseline immune status (susceptibility) and contemporaneous assessment of risks and risk factors for dengue illness.","466":"This study aimed to assess the burden of malaria in terms of death and Disability-Adjusted Life Years lost (DALY) between 2000 and 2016.In 2016 there were an estimated 2,927,266 (95% CI, 525,000-6,983,000) new malaria cases in Ethiopia. It caused an estimated 4,782 deaths (95% CI 122.5-12,750) with a crude death rate of 4.7\/100,000 and Age-standardized death rate (ASDR) of 4.9\/100,000 population. However, the number of deaths due to malaria declined by 54% from the 2000's record of 10,412 deaths (95% CI 98.8-16180) within 16\u2009years and ASDR declined by 63% from the 2000 record. In the same year, DALY due to malaria was 365,900\u2009years (187,000\u2009years among male and 178,900\u2009years among females). It contributed for 0.78% of the total DALY in Ethiopia and 1% of the global DALY due to malaria. Around 332,100 life years (YLL) were lost and 35,200\u2009years were lived with disability (YLD) due to malaria. Mortality and DALY related to malaria is slightly higher among males; and under 5 children are highly affected.The research used data from Global Health Estimate 2016; that originally collected the information through vital registration, verbal autopsy, surveys, reports, published scientific articles, Global Burden of Disease study (GBD 2016) and modeling.Although, the burden of malaria is remarkably declining in Ethiopia; with a higher level of mortality and DALY, it still remained one of the public health problems. Therefore, strengthening the existing malaria prevention program is important to eliminate the disease within the target period.Globally malaria remains one of the high burden diseases particularly in developing countries. Ethiopia is one of the sub-Saharan countries highly endemic to malaria. Although, recently the burden of malaria was reduced remarkably through public health interventions designed during the Millennium Development Goals, it is still a major public health problem in Ethiopia. Hence, measuring the burden of the disease and assessing the trend is very important for monitoring the extent and changes over a period of time.","467":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract illness in infants and young children. It causes substantial morbidity and mortality in young children and older adults. As few therapeutic and prophylaxis options against RSV illness are currently available, there is a great need for effective RSV vaccines and immune-prophylaxis. Encouragingly, multiple vaccines and immuno-prophylaxis aiming to protect pediatric populations have shown promising progress in clinical trials. The three major preventive strategies include RSV F-protein-based vaccines for pregnant women, extended half-life monoclonal antibodies for neonates, and live-attenuated vaccines for infants. Each preventive strategy has its own merits and challenges yet to be overcome. Challenges also exist in maximizing vaccine impacts in the post-implementation era. This perspectives piece focuses on RSV preventive strategies in young children and highlights the remaining questions in current development of RSV immunization products and design of immunization programs.","468":"Digital proxies of human mobility and physical mixing have been used to monitor viral transmissibility and effectiveness of social distancing interventions in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We develop a new framework that parameterizes disease transmission models with age-specific digital mobility data. By fitting the model to case data in Hong Kong, we are able to accurately track the local effective reproduction number of COVID-19 in near real time (i.e., no longer constrained by the delay of around 9 days between infection and reporting of cases) which is essential for quick assessment of the effectiveness of interventions on reducing transmissibility. Our findings show that accurate nowcast and forecast of COVID-19 epidemics can be obtained by integrating valid digital proxies of physical mixing into conventional epidemic models.","469":"The epidemiology and transmission dynamics of infectious diseases must be understood at the individual and community levels to improve public health decision-making for real-time and integrated community-based control strategies. Herein, we explore the epidemiological characteristics for assessing the impact of public health interventions in the community setting and their applications. Computational statistical methods could advance research on infectious disease epidemiology and accumulate scientific evidence of the potential impacts of pharmaceutical\/nonpharmaceutical measures to mitigate or control infectious diseases in the community. Novel public health threats from emerging zoonotic infectious diseases are urgent issues. Given these direct and indirect mitigating impacts at various levels to different infectious diseases and their burdens, we must consider an integrated assessment approach, 'One Health', to understand the dynamics and control of infectious diseases.","470":"The regression discontinuity design (RDD), first proposed in the educational psychology literature and popularized in econometrics in the 1960s, has only recently been applied to epidemiologic research. A critical aim of infectious disease epidemiologists and global health researchers is to evaluate disease prevention and control strategies, including the impact of vaccines and vaccination programs. RDDs have very rarely been used in this context. This quasi-experimental approach using observational data is designed to quantify the effect of an intervention when eligibility for the intervention is based on a defined cutoff such as age or grade in school, making it ideally suited to estimating vaccine effects given that many vaccination programs and mass-vaccination campaigns define eligibility in this way. Here, we describe key features of RDDs in general, then specific scenarios, with examples, to illustrate that RDDs are an important tool for advancing our understanding of vaccine effects. We argue that epidemiologic researchers should consider RDDs when evaluating interventions designed to prevent and control diseases. This approach can address a wide range of research questions, especially those for which randomized clinical trials would present major challenges or be infeasible. Finally, we propose specific ways in which RDDs could advance future vaccine research.","471":"Overall, Google Search yielded the highest click-through rate (7.1%) and conversion rate (7.0%) compared to Google Display, Grindr, and Facebook (click-through rates=0.4%-3.3%; conversion rates=0%-0.03%). Although the spend per 1000 impressions and per click was higher for Google Search compared to other platforms, the spend per conversion-which measures the number of people intending to attend the clinic for services-was substantially lower for Google Search (US $48.19 vs US $3120.42-US $3436.03).We evaluated a multiplatform, digital social marketing campaign intended to increase use of HIV\/STI testing, treatment, and prevention services among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) at an LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and\/or questioning) community health center.We evaluated engagement with a social marketing campaign launched by Open Door Health, the only LGBTQ+ community health center in Rhode Island, during the first 8 months of implementation (April to November 2021). Three types of advertisements encouraging use of HIV\/STI services were developed and implemented on Google Search, Google Display, Grindr, and Facebook. Platforms tracked the number of times that an advertisement was displayed to a user (impressions), that a user clicked through to a landing page that facilitated scheduling (clicks), and that a user requested a call to schedule an appointment from the landing page (conversions). We calculated the click-through rate (clicks per impression), conversion rate (conversions per click), and the dollar amount spent per 1000 impressions and per click and conversion.Little is known about how best to reach people with social marketing messages promoting use of clinical HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) services.Campaigns using the Google Search platform may yield the greatest return on investment for engaging MSM in HIV\/STI services at community health clinics. Future studies are needed to measure clinical outcomes among those who present to the clinic for services after viewing campaign advertisements and to compare the return on investment with use of social marketing campaigns relative to other approaches.","472":"Over the 20-year study period, RSV, bronchiolitis, and influenza were listed as the underlying causes of death on 932, 1046, and 52\u2005293 death certificates, respectively. Children <1 year of age accounted for 39% of RSV and bronchiolitis deaths, while 72% of influenza deaths were in adults \u226565 years. Children <1 year were more likely to die outside of the hospital from RSV, bronchiolitis, or influenza compared to all causes (P\u2009<\u2009.01), and black infants had the highest mortality rate for all 3 causes. Most infants dying from RSV did not have a high-risk condition listed on the death certificate. Death certificates captured 20%-60% of estimated excess RSV-attributable mortality in infants and <1% in seniors.We used International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes listed on death certificates to characterize deaths from 1999 to 2018 as RSV, influenza, and unspecified bronchiolitis. We described the distribution of each cause of death by age, sex, race\/ethnicity, place of death, and contributing causes of death.Thorough reporting on death certificates is an important public health goal, especially as new therapeutics become available. Infants had higher odds of dying out of hospital from respiratory pathogens compared to other causes, and race\/ethnicity alone did not explain this disparity.Death certificate data can improve our understanding of the mortality burden associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza.","473":"Non-negligible frequency of super-spreading events, short serial intervals, and a higher risk of being infected outside of households for male people of working age indicate a significant barrier to the identification and management of COVID-19 cases, which requires enhanced non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate this pandemic.Knowledge on the epidemiological features and transmission patterns of COVID-19 is accumulating. Detailed line-list data with household settings can advance the understanding of COVID-19 transmission dynamics.A unique database with detailed demographic characteristics, travel history, social relationships, and epidemiological timelines for 1,407 transmission pairs that formed 643 transmission clusters in mainland China was reconstructed from 9,120 COVID-19 confirmed cases reported during January 15 - February 29, 2020. Statistical model fittings were used to identify the super-spreaders and estimate serial interval distributions. Age and gender-stratified hazard of infection were estimated for household versus non-household transmissions.There were 34 primary cases identified as super-spreaders, with 5 super-spreading events occurred within households. Mean and standard deviation of serial intervals were estimated as 5.0 (95% CrI: 4.4, 5.5) and 5.2 (95% CrI: 4.9, 5.7) days for household transmissions and 5.2 (95% CrI: 4.6, 5.8) and 5.3 (95% CrI: 4.9, 5.7) days for non-household transmissions, respectively. Hazard of being infected outside of households is higher for age between 18 and 64 years, whereas hazard of being infected within households is higher for young and old people.","474":"There is a consensus that mass vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 will ultimately end the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is not clear when and which control measures can be relaxed during the rollout of vaccination programmes. We investigate relaxation scenarios using an age-structured transmission model that has been fitted to age-specific seroprevalence data, hospital admissions, and projected vaccination coverage for Portugal. Our analyses suggest that the pressing need to restart socioeconomic activities could lead to new pandemic waves, and that substantial control efforts prove necessary throughout 2021. Using knowledge on control measures introduced in 2020, we anticipate that relaxing measures completely or to the extent as in autumn 2020 could launch a wave starting in April 2021. Additional waves could be prevented altogether if measures are relaxed as in summer 2020 or in a step-wise manner throughout 2021. We discuss at which point the\u00a0control of COVID-19 would be achieved for each scenario.","475":"In this head-to-head comparison, older adults receiving enhanced vaccines showed improved humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, compared to standard-dose vaccine recipients.NCT03330132.Mean fold rises (MFR) in HAI titers to egg-propagated A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) and the MFR in MN to cell-propagated A(H3N2) were statistically significantly higher in the enhanced vaccine groups, compared to the standard-dose vaccine. The MFR in MN to cell-propagated A(H3N2) was highest among rHA recipients (4.7), followed by high-dose (3.4) and MF59-adjuvanted (2.9) recipients, compared to standard-dose recipients (2.3). Similarly, the ratio of postvaccination MN titers among rHA recipients to cell-propagated A(H3N2) recipients was 2.57-fold higher than the standard-dose vaccine, which was statistically higher than the high-dose (1.33-fold) and MF59-adjuvanted (1.43-fold) recipient ratios. Enhanced vaccines also resulted in the boosting of T-cell responses.Enhanced influenza vaccines may improve protection for older adults, but comparative immunogenicity data are limited. Our objective was to examine immune responses to enhanced influenza vaccines, compared to standard-dose vaccines, in community-dwelling older adults.Community-dwelling older adults aged 65-82 years in Hong Kong were randomly allocated (October 2017-January 2018) to receive 2017-2018 Northern hemisphere formulations of a standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine, MF59-adjuvanted trivalent vaccine, high-dose trivalent vaccine, or recombinant-hemagglutinin (rHA) quadrivalent vaccine. Sera collected from 200 recipients of each vaccine before and at 30-days postvaccination were assessed for antibodies to egg-propagated vaccine strains by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and to cell-propagated A\/Hong Kong\/4801\/2014(H3N2) virus by microneutralization (MN). Influenza-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were assessed in 20 participants per group.","476":"In 2023, cholera affected approximately 1 million people and caused more than 5000 deaths globally, predominantly in low-income and conflict settings. In recent years, the number of new cholera outbreaks has grown rapidly. Further, ongoing cholera outbreaks have been exacerbated by conflict, climate change, and poor infrastructure, resulting in prolonged crises. As a result, the demand for treatment and intervention is quickly outpacing existing resource availability. Prior to improved water and sanitation systems, cholera, a disease primarily transmitted via contaminated water sources, also routinely ravaged high-income countries. Crumbling infrastructure and climate change are now putting new locations at risk - even in high-income countries. Thus, understanding the transmission and prevention of cholera is critical. Combating cholera requires multiple interventions, the two most common being behavioral education and water treatment. Two-dose oral cholera vaccination (OCV) is often used as a complement to these interventions. Due to limited supply, countries have recently switched to single-dose vaccines (OCV1). One challenge lies in understanding where to allocate OCV1 in a timely manner, especially in settings lacking well-resourced public health surveillance systems. As cholera occurs and propagates in such locations, timely, accurate, and openly accessible outbreak data are typically inaccessible for disease modeling and subsequent decision-making. In this study, we demonstrated the value of open-access data to rapidly estimate cholera transmission and vaccine effectiveness. Specifically, we obtained non-machine readable (NMR) epidemic curves for recent cholera outbreaks in two countries, Haiti and Cameroon, from figures published in situation and disease outbreak news reports. We used computational digitization techniques to derive weekly counts of cholera cases, resulting in nominal differences when compared against the reported cumulative case counts (i.e., a relative error rate of 5.67% in Haiti and 0.54% in Cameroon). Given these digitized time series, we leveraged EpiEstim-an open-source modeling platform-to derive rapid estimates of time-varying disease transmission via the effective reproduction number ( Rt ). To compare OCV1 effectiveness in the two considered countries, we additionally used VaxEstim, a recent extension of EpiEstim that facilitates the estimation of vaccine effectiveness via the relation among three inputs: the basic reproduction number ( R0 ), Rt , and vaccine coverage. Here, with Haiti and Cameroon as case studies, we demonstrated the first implementation of VaxEstim in low-resource settings. Importantly, we are the first to use VaxEstim with digitized data rather than traditional epidemic surveillance data. In the initial phase of the outbreak, weekly rolling average estimates of Rt were elevated in both countries: 2.60 in Haiti [95% credible interval: 2.42-2.79] and 1.90 in Cameroon [1.14-2.95]. These values are largely consistent with previous estimates of R0 in Haiti, where average values have ranged from 1.06 to 3.72, and in Cameroon, where average values have ranged from 1.10 to 3.50. In both Haiti and Cameroon, this initial period of high transmission preceded a longer period during which Rt oscillated around the critical threshold of 1. Our results derived from VaxEstim suggest that Haiti had higher OCV1 effectiveness than Cameroon (75.32% effective [54.00-86.39%] vs. 54.88% [18.94-84.90%]). These estimates of OCV1 effectiveness are generally aligned with those derived from field studies conducted in other countries. Thus, our case study reinforces the validity of VaxEstim as an alternative to costly, time-consuming field studies of OCV1 effectiveness. Indeed, prior work in South Sudan, Bangladesh, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo reported OCV1 effectiveness ranging from approximately 40% to 80%. This work underscores the value of combining NMR sources of outbreak case data with computational techniques and the utility of VaxEstim for rapid, inexpensive estimation of vaccine effectiveness in data-poor outbreak settings.","477":"In a large community-randomized trial, biannual azithromycin distributions significantly reduced postneonatal childhood mortality in sub-Saharan African sites. Here, we present a prespecified secondary analysis showing that much of the protective effect was in the first 3 months postdistribution.

Until now, the recommendation's impact on hepatitis C screening rates in the United States has not been fully understood. We used an interrupted time series with comparison group design to analyze hepatitis C screening rates in the period 2010-14 among 2.8\u00a0million commercially insured adults in the MarketScan database. Hepatitis C screening rates increased yearly between 2010 and 2014, from 1.65 to 2.59 per 100 person-years. A 49\u00a0percent increase in screening rates among people born during 1945-65 followed the release of the recommendation, but no such increase was observed among adults born after 1965. The effect among the target population was sustained, and by twenty-four months after the recommendation's release, screening rates had increased 106\u00a0percent. We conclude that the hepatitis C testing policy change resulted in significantly increased testing among the target population and may have decreased the magnitude of the hepatitis C epidemic.","479":"Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, US hospitals relied on static projections of future trends for long-term planning and were only beginning to consider forecasting methods for short-term planning of staffing and other resources. With the overwhelming burden imposed by COVID-19 on the health care system, an emergent need exists to accurately forecast hospitalization needs within an actionable timeframe.Our goal was to leverage an existing COVID-19 case and death forecasting tool to generate the expected number of concurrent hospitalizations, occupied intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and in-use ventilators 1 day to 4 weeks in the future for New Mexico and each of its five health regions.Real-time forecasting of the burden imposed by a spreading infectious disease is a crucial component of decision support during a public health emergency. Our proposed methodology demonstrated utility in providing near-term forecasts, particularly at the state level. This tool can aid other stakeholders as they face COVID-19 population impacts now and in the future.We developed a probabilistic model that took as input the number of new COVID-19 cases for New Mexico from Los Alamos National Laboratory's COVID-19 Forecasts Using Fast Evaluations and Estimation tool, and we used the model to estimate the number of new daily hospital admissions 4 weeks into the future based on current statewide hospitalization rates. The model estimated the number of new admissions that would require an ICU bed or use of a ventilator and then projected the individual lengths of hospital stays based on the resource need. By tracking the lengths of stay through time, we captured the projected simultaneous need for inpatient beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. We used a postprocessing method to adjust the forecasts based on the differences between prior forecasts and the subsequent observed data. Thus, we ensured that our forecasts could reflect a dynamically changing situation on the ground.Forecasts made between September 1 and December 9, 2020, showed variable accuracy across time, health care resource needs, and forecast horizon. Forecasts made in October, when new COVID-19 cases were steadily increasing, had an average accuracy error of 20.0%, while the error in forecasts made in September, a month with low COVID-19 activity, was 39.7%. Across health care use categories, state-level forecasts were more accurate than those at the regional level. Although the accuracy declined as the forecast was projected further into the future, the stated uncertainty of the prediction improved. Forecasts were within 5% of their stated uncertainty at the 50% and 90% prediction intervals at the 3- to 4-week forecast horizon for state-level inpatient and ICU needs. However, uncertainty intervals were too narrow for forecasts of state-level ventilator need and all regional health care resource needs.","480":"We used national death registration data in South Africa from 1999 to 2016 to assess the impact of PCV introduction on all-cause pneumonia mortality in all ages, with the exclusion of infants aged <1 month. We created a composite (synthetic) control using Bayesian variable selection of nondiarrheal, nonpneumonia, and nonpneumococcal deaths to estimate the number of expected all-cause pneumonia deaths in the absence of PCV introduction post 2009. We compared all-cause pneumonia deaths from the death registry to the expected deaths in 2012 to 2016. We also estimated the number of prevented deaths during 2009 to 2016. Of the 9,324,638 deaths reported in South Africa from 1999 to 2016, 12\u00b76% were pneumonia-related. Compared to number of deaths expected, we estimated a 33% (95% credible interval (CrI) 26% to 43%), 23% (95%CrI 17% to 29%), 25% (95%CrI 19% to 32%), and 23% (95%CrI 11% to 32%) reduction in pneumonia mortality in children aged 1 to 11 months, 1 to 4 years, 5 to 7 years, and 8 to 18 years in 2012 to 2016, respectively. In total, an estimated 18,422 (95%CrI 12,388 to 26,978) pneumonia-related deaths were prevented from 2009 to 2016 in children aged <19 years. No declines were estimated observed among adults following PCV introduction. This study was mainly limited by coding errors in original data that could have led to a lower impact estimate, and unmeasured factors could also have confounded estimates.This study found that the introduction of PCV was associated with substantial reduction in all-cause pneumonia deaths in children aged 1 month to <19 years. The model predicted an effect of PCV in age groups who were eligible for vaccination (1 months to 4 years), and an indirect effect in those too old (8 to 18 years) to be vaccinated. These findings support sustaining pneumococcal vaccination to reduce pneumonia-related mortality in children.Data on the national-level impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) introduction on mortality are lacking from Africa. PCV was introduced in South Africa in 2009. We estimated the impact of PCV introduction on all-cause pneumonia mortality in South Africa, while controlling for changes in mortality due to other interventions.","481":"Conferences are spaces to meet and network within and across academic and technical fields, learn about new advances, and share our work.

Across species, secondary sexual characteristics such as competitive aggression and territoriality are considered male-specific behaviors. However, although female-female aggression is often a behavior that is displayed almost exclusively to protect the offspring, multiple examples of female-female competitive aggression have been reported in both invertebrate and vertebrate species. Moreover, cases of intersexual aggression have been observed in a variety of species. Genetically tractable model systems such as mice, zebrafish, and fruit flies have proven extremely valuable for studying the underlying neuronal circuitry and the genetic architecture of aggressive behavior under laboratory conditions. However, most studies lack ethological or ecological perspectives and the behavioral patterns available are limited. The goal of this review is to discuss each of these forms of aggression, male intrasexual aggression, intersexual aggression and female intrasexual aggression in the context of the most common genetic animal models and discuss examples of these behaviors in other species.","483":"Despite many recent efforts to predict and control emerging infectious disease threats to humans, we failed to anticipate the zoonotic viruses which led to pandemics in 2009 and 2020. The morbidity, mortality, and economic costs of these pandemics have been staggering. We desperately need a more targeted, cost-efficient, and sustainable strategy to detect and mitigate future zoonotic respiratory virus threats. Evidence suggests that the transition from an animal virus to a human pathogen is incremental and requires a considerable number of spillover events and considerable time before a pandemic variant emerges. This evolutionary view argues for the refocusing of public health resources on novel respiratory virus surveillance at human-animal interfaces in geographical hotspots for emerging infectious diseases. Where human-animal interface surveillance is not possible, a secondary high-yield, cost-efficient strategy is to conduct novel respiratory virus surveillance among pneumonia patients in these same hotspots. When novel pathogens are discovered, they must be quickly assessed for their human risk and, if indicated, mitigation strategies initiated. In this review, we discuss the most common respiratory virus threats, current efforts at early emerging pathogen detection, and propose and defend new molecular pathogen discovery strategies with the goal of preempting future pandemics.","484":"The primary objectives of this study are to (1) determine the incidence of, and risk factors for, SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCP at a tertiary care medical center and (2) actively monitor PPE use, interactions between study participants via electronic sensors, secondary cases in households, and participant mental health and well-being.As of December 31, 2020, 211 HCP and 53 household participants have been enrolled. Recruitment and follow-up are ongoing and expected to continue through September 2021.DERR1-10.2196\/25410.To achieve these objectives, we designed a prospective, observational study of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCP and their household contacts at an academic tertiary care medical center in North Carolina, USA. Enrolled HCP completed frequent surveys on symptoms and work activities and provided serum and nasal samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing every 2 weeks. Additionally, interactions between participants and their movement within the clinical environment were captured with a smartphone app and Bluetooth sensors. Finally, a subset of participants' households was randomly selected every 2 weeks for further investigation, and enrolled households provided serum and nasal samples via at-home collection kits.Much remains to be learned regarding the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCP and their household contacts. Through the use of a multifaceted prospective study design and a well-characterized cohort, we will collect critical information regarding SARS-CoV-2 transmission risks in the health care setting and its linkage to the community.Health care personnel (HCP) are at high risk for exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. While personal protective equipment (PPE) may mitigate this risk, prospective data collection on its use and other risk factors for seroconversion in this population is needed.","485":"Recent dramatic declines in global malaria burden and mortality can be largely attributed to the large-scale deployment of insecticidal-based measures, namely long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying. However, the sustainability of these gains, and the feasibility of global malaria eradication by 2040, may be affected by increasing insecticide resistance among the Anopheles malaria vector. We employ a new differential-equations based mathematical model, which incorporates the full, weather-dependent mosquito lifecycle, to assess the population-level impact of the large-scale use of LLINs, under different levels of Anopheles pyrethroid insecticide resistance, on malaria transmission dynamics and control in a community. Moreover, we describe the bednet-mosquito interaction using parameters that can be estimated from the large experimental hut trial literature under varying levels of effective pyrethroid resistance. An expression for the basic reproduction number, [Formula: see text], as a function of population-level bednet coverage, is derived. It is shown, owing to the phenomenon of backward bifurcation, that [Formula: see text] must be pushed appreciably below 1 to eliminate malaria in endemic areas, potentially complicating eradication efforts. Numerical simulations of the model suggest that, when the baseline [Formula: see text] is high (corresponding roughly to holoendemic malaria), very high bednet coverage with highly effective nets is necessary to approach conditions for malaria elimination. Further, while >50% bednet coverage is likely sufficient to strongly control or eliminate malaria from areas with a mesoendemic malaria baseline, pyrethroid resistance could undermine control and elimination efforts even in this setting. Our simulations show that pyrethroid resistance in mosquitoes appreciably reduces bednet effectiveness across parameter space. This modeling study also suggests that increasing pre-bloodmeal deterrence of mosquitoes (deterring them from entry into protected homes) actually hampers elimination efforts, as it may focus mosquito biting onto a smaller unprotected host subpopulation. Finally, we observe that temperature affects malaria potential independently of bednet coverage and pyrethroid-resistance levels, with both climate change and pyrethroid resistance posing future threats to malaria control.","486":"Health inequities are assessed by health departments to identify social groups disproportionately burdened by disease and by academic researchers to understand how social, economic, and environmental inequities manifest as health inequities. To characterize inequities, group-specific small-area health data are often modeled using log-linear generalized linear models (GLM) or generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with a random intercept. These approaches estimate the same marginal rate ratio comparing disease rates across groups under standard assumptions. Here we explore how residential segregation combined with social group differences in disease risk can lead to contradictory findings from the GLM and GLMM. We show that this occurs because small-area disease rate data collected under these conditions induce endogeneity in the GLMM due to correlation between the model's offset and random effect. This results in GLMM estimates that represent conditional rather than marginal associations. We refer to endogeneity arising from the offset, which to our knowledge has not been noted previously, as \"offset endogeneity\". We illustrate this phenomenon in simulated data and real premature mortality data, and we propose alternative modeling approaches to address it. We also introduce to a statistical audience the social epidemiologic terminology for framing health inequities, which enables responsible interpretation of results.","487":"We used an agent-based model with a realistic treatment of human mobility and vector control. We found that a lockdown in which 70% of the population sheltered at home and which occurred in a season when a new serotype invaded could lead to a small average increase in cumulative DENV infections of up to 10%, depending on the time of year lockdown occurred. Lockdown had a more pronounced effect on the spatial distribution of DENV infections, with higher incidence under lockdown in regions with higher mosquito abundance. Transmission was also more focused in homes following lockdown. The proportion of people infected in their own home rose from 54% under normal conditions to 66% under lockdown, and the household secondary attack rate rose from 0.109 to 0.128, a 17% increase. When we considered that lockdown measures could disrupt regular, city-wide vector control campaigns, the increase in incidence was more pronounced than with lockdown alone, especially if lockdown occurred at the optimal time for vector control.The COVID-19 pandemic has induced unprecedented reductions in human mobility and social contacts throughout the world. Because dengue virus (DENV) transmission is strongly driven by human mobility, behavioral changes associated with the pandemic have been hypothesized to impact dengue incidence. By discouraging human contact, COVID-19 control measures have also disrupted dengue vector control interventions, the most effective of which require entry into homes. We sought to investigate how and why dengue incidence could differ under a lockdown scenario with a proportion of the population sheltered at home.Our results indicate that an unintended outcome of lockdown measures may be to adversely alter the epidemiology of dengue. This observation has important implications for an improved understanding of dengue epidemiology and effective application of dengue vector control. When coordinating public health responses during a syndemic, it is important to monitor multiple infections and understand that an intervention against one disease may exacerbate another.","488":"The World Health Organization declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern in July 2022. To investigate global mpox transmission and population-level changes associated with controlling spread, we built phylogeographic and phylodynamic models to analyze MPXV genomes from five global regions together with air traffic and epidemiological data. Our models reveal community transmission prior to detection, changes in case reporting throughout the epidemic, and a large degree of transmission heterogeneity. We find that viral introductions played a limited role in prolonging spread after initial dissemination, suggesting that travel bans would have had only a minor impact. We find that mpox transmission in North America began declining before more than 10% of high-risk individuals in the USA had vaccine-induced immunity. Our findings highlight the importance of broader routine specimen screening surveillance for emerging infectious diseases and of joint integration of genomic and epidemiological information for early outbreak control.","489":" . These findings suggest that animal wastewater should be anaerobically digested prior to use in irrigation to remove harmful pathogens.","490":"To assess the effects of UTT program on HIV treatment outcomes and patient survival among a cohort of adult HIV infected patients taking antiretroviral treatment in Gurage zone health facilities.Through universal \"test and treat approach\" (UTT) it is believed that HIV new infection and AIDS related death will be reduced at community level and through time HIV can be eliminated. With this assumption the UTT program was implemented since 2016. However, the effect of this program in terms of individual patient survival and treatment outcome was not assessed in relation to the pre-existing defer treatment approach.Institution based retrospective cohort study was conducted in facilities providing HIV care and treatment. Eight years (2012-2019) HIV\/AIDS treatment records were included in the study. Five hundred HIV\/AIDS treatment records were randomly selected and reviewed. Data were abstracted using standardized checklist by trained health professionals; then it was cleaned, edited and entered by Epi info version 7 and analyzed by STATA. Cox model was built to estimate survival differences across different study variables.Mortality was significantly reduced after UTT. Therefore, intervention to further reduce deaths has to focus on early initiation of treatment and strengthening UTT programs. test\u2009=\u20094.1, p value\u2009=\u20090.04). Age, residence, base line CD4 count, program of enrolment, development of new OIS and treatment failure were predicted mortality from HIV infection.","491":"Ghanaian infants had a relatively low case fatality rate due to intussusception, with a substantial proportion of cases treated non-surgically. Early presentation for treatment, possibly enhanced by community-based health education programs and health information from various media platforms during the study period might contribute to both the low fatality rate and high number of successful non-surgical treatments in this population.we examined the epidemiology, clinical and demographic characteristics of intussusception in Ghanaian infants.active sentinel surveillance for pediatric intussusception was conducted at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi and Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra. From March 2012 to December 2016, infants < 1 year of age who met the Brighton Collaboration level 1 diagnostic criteria for intussusception were enrolled. Data were collected through parental interviews and medical records abstraction.a total of 378 children < 1 year of age were enrolled. Median age at onset of intussusception was 27 weeks; only 12 cases (1%) occurred in infants < 12 weeks while most occurred in infants aged 22-34 weeks. Median time from symptom onset until referral to a tertiary hospital was 2 days (IQR: 1-4 days). Overall, 35% of infants were treated by enema, 33% had surgical reduction and 32% required surgical reduction and bowel resection. Median length of hospital stay was 5 days (IQR: 3-8 days) with most patients (95%) discharged home. Eleven (3%) infants died. Infants undergoing enema reduction were more likely than those treated surgically to present for treatment sooner after symptom onset (median 1 vs 3 days; p < 0.0001) and have shorter hospital stays (median 3 vs 7 days; p < 0.001).","492":"), an association which may be used as a proxy for anthropogenic activities. Chemical analysis of water samples for three major groups of antibiotics was below the detection limit. However, the high richness and gene copy numbers (GCNs) of ARGs in impacted sites suggest that the effects of effluents on microbial communities are occurring even at low concentrations of antimicrobials in the water column. Antibiotic resistance and integrase genes in a year-long metagenomic study showed that ARGs were driven mainly by environmental factors from anthropogenized sites in agriculture and urban watersheds. Environmental factors such as land-use and water quality parameters accounted for 45% of the variability observed in watershed locations.","493":"). In doing so, we improve on generic observations that epistasis is widespread by discussing how patterns of epistasis can be partly explained by specific interactions between mutations in an essential enzyme and genes associated with the proteostasis environment. These findings speak to the role of environmental and genotypic context in modulating higher-order epistasis, with direct implications for evolutionary theory, genetic modification technology, and efforts to manage antimicrobial resistance.","494":"Posterior ligamentous complex injuries of the thoracolumbar (TL) spine represent a major consideration during surgical decision-making. However, X-ray and computed tomography imaging often does not identify those injuries and sometimes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not available or is contraindicated. To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the ultrasound for detecting posterior ligamentous complex injuries in the TL spine. A systematic review was carried out through four international databases and proceedings of scientific meetings. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, diagnostic odds ratio, and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated, by using weighted averages according to the sample size of each study. Summary receiver operating characteristic was also estimated. A total of four articles were included in the meta-analysis, yielding a summary estimate: Sensitivity, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.86-0.92); specificity, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.98-1.00); positive likelihood ratio, 224.49 (95% CI, 30.43-1656.26); negative likelihood ratio, 0.11 (95% CI, 0.05-0.19); and diagnostic odds ratio, 2,268.13 (95% CI, 265.84-19,351.24). There was no statistically significant heterogeneity among results of included studies. Receiver operating characteristic (\u00b1standard error) was 0.928 \u00b1 0.047. The present meta-analysis showed that ultrasound has a high accuracy for diagnosing posterior ligamentous complex injuries in patients with flexion distraction, compression, or burst TL fractures. On the basis of present results, ultrasound may be considered as a useful alternative when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is unavailable or contraindicated, or when its results are inconclusive.","495":"Mathematical modelling is commonly used to evaluate infectious disease control policy and is influential in shaping policy and budgets. Mathematical models necessarily make assumptions about disease natural history and, if these assumptions are not valid, the results of these studies can be biased. We did a systematic review of published tuberculosis transmission models to assess the validity of assumptions about progression to active disease after initial infection (PROSPERO ID CRD42016030009). We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Biosis, and Cochrane Library, and included studies from the earliest available date (Jan 1, 1962) to Aug 31, 2017. We identified 312 studies that met inclusion criteria. Predicted tuberculosis incidence varied widely across studies for each risk factor investigated. For population groups with no individual risk factors, annual incidence varied by several orders of magnitude, and 20-year cumulative incidence ranged from close to 0% to 100%. A substantial proportion of modelled results were inconsistent with empirical evidence: for 10-year cumulative incidence, 40% of modelled results were more than double or less than half the empirical estimates. These results demonstrate substantial disagreement between modelling studies on a central feature of tuberculosis natural history. Greater attention to reproducing known features of epidemiology would strengthen future tuberculosis modelling studies, and readers of modelling studies are recommended to assess how well those studies demonstrate their validity.","496":"With a dataset of testing and case counts from over 1,400 institutions of higher education (IHEs) in the United States, we analyze the number of infections and deaths from SARS-CoV-2 in the counties surrounding these IHEs during the Fall 2020 semester (August to December, 2020). We find that counties with IHEs that remained primarily online experienced fewer cases and deaths during the Fall 2020 semester; whereas before and after the semester, these two groups had almost identical COVID-19 incidence. Additionally, we see fewer cases and deaths in counties with IHEs that reported conducting any on-campus testing compared to those that reported none. To perform these two comparisons, we used a matching procedure designed to create well-balanced groups of counties that are aligned as much as possible along age, race, income, population, and urban\/rural categories-demographic variables that have been shown to be correlated with COVID-19 outcomes. We conclude with a case study of IHEs in Massachusetts-a state with especially high detail in our dataset-which further highlights the importance of IHE-affiliated testing for the broader community. The results in this work suggest that campus testing can itself be thought of as a mitigation policy and that allocating additional resources to IHEs to support efforts to regularly test students and staff would be beneficial to mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in a pre-vaccine environment.","497":"Echinoderms are a phylum of marine deterostomes with a range of interesting biological features. One remarkable ability is their impressive capacity to regenerate most of their adult tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). The research community has accumulated data that demonstrates that, in spite of the pentaradial adult body plan, echinoderms share deep similarities with their bilateral sister taxa such as hemichordates and chordates. Some of the new data reveal the complexity of the nervous system in echinoderms. In terms of the cellular architecture, one of the traits that is shared between the CNS of echinoderms and chordates is the presence of radial glia. In chordates, these cells act as the main progenitor population in CNS development. In mammals, radial glia are spent in embryogenesis and are no longer present in adults, being replaced with other neural cell types. In non-mammalian chordates, they are still detected in the mature CNS along with other types of glia. In echinoderms, radial glia also persist into the adulthood, but unlike in chordates, it is the only known glial cell type that is present in the fully developed CNS. The echinoderm radial glia is a multifunctional cell type. Radial glia forms the supporting scaffold of the neuroepithelium, exhibits secretory activity, clears up dying or damaged cells by phagocytosis, and, most importantly, acts as a major progenitor cell population. The latter function is critical for the outstanding developmental plasticity of the adult echinoderm CNS, including physiological cell turnover, indeterminate growth, and a remarkable capacity to regenerate major parts following autotomy or traumatic injury. In this review we summarize the current knowledge on the organization and function of the echinoderm radial glia, with a focus on the role of this cell type in adult neurogenesis.","498":" = 2, twice as many ICU beds would be required at the peak of outbreak in the absence of self-isolation. In this scenario, the proportional impact of self-isolation within 24 h on reducing the peak number of ICU beds is substantially higher at 73.5% (interquartile range 71.4-75.3%). Our estimates underscore the inadequacy of critical care capacity to handle the burgeoning outbreak. Policies that encourage self-isolation, such as paid sick leave, may delay the epidemic peak, giving a window of time that could facilitate emergency mobilization to expand hospital capacity.","499":"Spatially heterogeneous landscape factors such as urbanisation can have substantial effects on the severity and spread of wildlife diseases. However, research linking patterns of pathogen transmission to landscape features remains rare. Using a combination of phylogeographic and machine learning approaches, we tested the influence of landscape and host factors on feline immunodeficiency virus (FIVLru) genetic variation and spread among bobcats (Lynx rufus) sampled from coastal southern California. We found evidence for increased rates of FIVLru lineage spread through areas of higher vegetation density. Furthermore, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation among FIVLru sequences was associated with host genetic distances and geographic location, with FIVLru genetic discontinuities precisely correlating with known urban barriers to host dispersal. An effect of forest land cover on FIVLru SNP variation was likely attributable to host population structure and differences in forest land cover between different populations. Taken together, these results suggest that the spread of FIVLru is constrained by large-scale urban barriers to host movement. Although urbanisation at fine spatial scales did not appear to directly influence virus transmission or spread, we found evidence that viruses transmit and spread more quickly through areas containing higher proportions of natural habitat. These multiple lines of evidence demonstrate how urbanisation can change patterns of contact-dependent pathogen transmission and provide insights into how continued urban development may influence the incidence and management of wildlife disease.","500":"A budget impact model was developed using a decision tree framework and applied over 9 influenza seasons (2010\/11 to 2018\/19). The decision tree model was designed to capture influenza cases, hospitalizations possibly related to influenza or laboratory confirmed influenza, and influenza-related deaths. The analysis included influenza vaccines recommended by ACIP since 2010: SD TIV (trivalent), SD QIV (quadrivalent), HD TIV, aTIV (adjuvanted), ccQIV (cell-cultured). Two strategies were compared to evaluate the impact of HD TIV: a 'with HD TIV' strategy representative of the US vaccine landscape, and a 'without HD TIV' where the absence of HD TIV was modelled. Clinical and economic inputs were based on public US data from the CDC and national databases, while data on vaccine effectiveness were extracted from published literature and clinical trials. The impact of HD TIV was further explored in five scenario analyses and deterministic sensitivity analyses (DSA).Over 10\u00a0years, it is estimated that HD TIV resulted in an averted 1,333,479 influenza cases, 769,476 medical visits, 40,004 ED presentations, 520,342 cardiorespiratory hospitalizations and 73,689 deaths and generated an absolute $4.6 billion in savings, translating into a return on investment of 214.4%. Hospitalizations costs represented 98.4% and 98.3% of the management costs in the 'with HD TIV' strategy and 'without HD TIV' strategy respectively. Hospitalizations and HD TIV relative vaccine efficacy vs SD TIV as a major cost driver were further confirmed in scenario analysis and DSA. HD TIV remained cost saving under all the scenarios.The objective of this study was to estimate the public health and economic benefits (from a Medicare perspective) of Fluzone High-Dose\u00ae in the US elderly population, since its introduction in 2010.The model showed that HD TIV higher efficacy translated into increased averted health and economic outcomes. HD TIV represented a cost saving intervention from a payer perspective since its introduction.","501":"To develop a natural language processing system that identifies relations of medications with adverse drug events from clinical narratives. This project is part of the 2018 n2c2 challenge.We developed a novel clinical named entity recognition method based on an recurrent convolutional neural network and compared it to a recurrent neural network implemented using the long-short term memory architecture, explored methods to integrate medical knowledge as embedding layers in neural networks, and investigated 3 machine learning models, including support vector machines, random forests and gradient boosting for relation classification. The performance of our system was evaluated using annotated data and scripts provided by the 2018 n2c2 organizers.Our system was among the top ranked. Our best model submitted during this challenge (based on recurrent neural networks and support vector machines) achieved lenient F1 scores of 0.9287 for concept extraction (ranked third), 0.9459 for relation classification (ranked fourth), and 0.8778 for the end-to-end relation extraction (ranked second). We developed a novel named entity recognition model based on a recurrent convolutional neural network and further investigated gradient boosting for relation classification. The new methods improved the lenient F1 scores of the 3 subtasks to 0.9292, 0.9633, and 0.8880, respectively, which are comparable to the best performance reported in this challenge.This study demonstrated the feasibility of using machine learning methods to extract the relations of medications with adverse drug events from clinical narratives.","502":"Individual-based models (IBMs) informing public health policy should be calibrated to data and provide estimates of uncertainty. Two main components of model-calibration methods are the parameter-search strategy and the goodness-of-fit (GOF) measure; many options exist for each of these. This review provides an overview of calibration methods used in IBMs modelling infectious disease spread. We identified articles on PubMed employing simulation-based methods to calibrate IBMs informing public health policy in HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria epidemiology published between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2018. Articles were included if models stored individual-specific information, and calibration involved comparing model output to population-level targets. We extracted information on parameter-search strategies, GOF measures, and model validation. The PubMed search identified 653 candidate articles, of which 84 met the review criteria. Of the included articles, 40 (48%) combined a quantitative GOF measure with an algorithmic parameter-search strategy-either an optimisation algorithm (14\/40) or a sampling algorithm (26\/40). These 40 articles varied widely in their choices of parameter-search strategies and GOF measures. For the remaining 44 (52%) articles, the parameter-search strategy could either not be identified (32\/44) or was described as an informal, non-reproducible method (12\/44). Of these 44 articles, the majority (25\/44) were unclear about the GOF measure used; of the rest, only five quantitatively evaluated GOF. Only a minority of the included articles, 14 (17%) provided a rationale for their choice of model-calibration method. Model validation was reported in 31 (37%) articles. Reporting on calibration methods is far from optimal in epidemiological modelling studies of HIV, malaria and TB transmission dynamics. The adoption of better documented, algorithmic calibration methods could improve both reproducibility and the quality of inference in model-based epidemiology. There is a need for research comparing the performance of calibration methods to inform decisions about the parameter-search strategies and GOF measures.","503":"During the COVID-19 outbreak, facility capacity for HIV testing has been limited. Further, people may have opted against HIV testing during this period to avoid COVID-19 exposure. We investigated the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV testing and the number of reported HIV cases in Japan.During the COVID-19 pandemic, the current HIV testing system in Japan seems to have missed more cases of HIV before developing AIDS. Continuously monitoring the situation as well as securing sufficient test resources by use of self-testing is essential to understand the clear epidemiological picture of HIV incidence during the COVID-19 pandemic.We analyzed quarterly HIV\/AIDS-related data from 2015 to the second quarter of 2020 using an anomaly detection approach. The data included the number of consultations, the number of HIV tests performed by public health centers or municipalities, and the number of newly reported HIV cases with and without an AIDS diagnosis. We further performed the same analysis for two subgroups: men who have sex with men (MSM) and non-Japanese persons.The number of HIV tests (9,584 vs. 35,908 in the year-before period) and consultations (11,689 vs. 32,565) performed by public health centers significantly declined in the second quarter of 2020, while the proportion of new HIV cases with an AIDS diagnosis (36.2% vs. 26.4%) significantly increased after removing the trend and seasonality effects. HIV cases without an AIDS diagnosis decreased (166 vs. 217), but the reduction was not significant. We confirmed similar trends for the MSM and non-Japanese subgroups.","504":"The following variables were included in the DAG: age, sex, time within influenza season and year, health status and comorbidities, study site, health-care-seeking behavior, contact patterns and social precautionary behavior, socioeconomic status, and pre-existing immunity. Across all age groups and settings, only adjustment for lung disease in older adults in the primary care setting resulted in a relative change of the IVE point estimate >10%.Establishing a large study network to conduct influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) studies while collecting appropriate variables to account for potential bias is important; the most relevant variables should be prioritized. We explored the impact of potential confounders on IVE in the DRIVE multi-country network of sites conducting test-negative design (TND) studies.We constructed a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to map the relationship between influenza vaccination, medically attended influenza infection, confounders, and other variables. Additionally, we used the Development of Robust and Innovative Vaccines Effectiveness (DRIVE) data from the 2018\/2019 and 2019\/2020 seasons to explore the effect of covariate adjustment on IVE estimates. The reference model was adjusted for age, sex, calendar time, and season. The covariates studied were presence of at least one, two, or three chronic diseases; presence of six specific chronic diseases; and prior healthcare use. Analyses were conducted by site and subsequently pooled.Our study supports a parsimonious approach to confounder adjustment in TND studies, limited to adjusting for age, sex, and calendar time. Practical implications are that necessitating fewer variables lowers the threshold for enrollment of sites in IVE studies and simplifies the pooling of data from different IVE studies or study networks.","505":"Gavi's HSS support emphasized inputs with short-term measurable outcomes. Harmonization of the concept of HSS and collaboration between Gavi and multilateral international agencies, such as World Bank and WHO, are needed.This paper aimed to compare the health systems strengthening (HSS) framework of Gavi and WHO and to analyze resource allocation in HSS by Gavi.Compared with WHO's HSS framework, Gavi's has a distinctive function within the building block 'Drugs, Equipment, Supplies, Facilities' and a distinctive function of 'providing incentive and bonuses' under the building block 'Human Resource\/Performance Management'. Gavi has steadily invested 10% of their total budget on HSS, but 47% were allocated in these categories, whereas 78% were for activities arguably not covered by WHO's HSS framework. In Africa, 70% of Gavi's budget fell under 'Drugs, Equipment, Supplies, Facilities' and 92.8% were for activities arguably not deemed as HSS by WHO.Among 76 countries which received HSS funding from Gavi from 2006 to 2013, summary reports of 44 countries and approved proposals of 10 countries were collected. After comparing the HSS framework of WHO and Gavi, each activity described in documents was categorized according to Gavi's framework and funding allocation was analyzed.","506":"In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions, social distancing is being used worldwide to curb the spread of COVID-19. The impact of these measures has been inconsistent, with some regions rapidly nearing disease elimination and others seeing delayed peaks or nearly flat epidemic curves. Here we build a stochastic epidemic model to examine the effects of COVID-19 clinical progression and transmission network structure on the outcomes of social distancing interventions. Our simulations show that long delays between the adoption of control measures and observed declines in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths occur in many scenarios. We find that the strength of within-household transmission is a critical determinant of success, governing the timing and size of the epidemic peak, the rate of decline, individual risks of infection, and the success of partial relaxation measures. The structure of residual external connections, driven by workforce participation and essential businesses, interacts to determine outcomes. We suggest limited conditions under which the formation of household \"bubbles\" can be safe. These findings can improve future predictions of the timescale and efficacy of interventions needed to control second waves of COVID-19 as well as other similar outbreaks, and highlight the need for better quantification and control of household transmission.","507":"Highly effective vaccines could dramatically reduce influenza burden. Model estimates suggest that even modest increases in vaccine efficacy could dramatically reduce seasonal influenza disease burden.Current influenza vaccines have limited effectiveness. COVID-19 vaccines using mRNA technology have demonstrated very high efficacy, suggesting that mRNA vaccines could be more effective for influenza. Several such influenza vaccines are in development. FRED, an agent-based modeling platform, was used to estimate the impact of more effective influenza vaccines on seasonal influenza burden.Highly effective vaccines significantly reduced estimated influenza cases in the model. When vaccine efficacy was increased from 40\u00a0% to a maximum of 95\u00a0%, estimated influenza cases in the US decreased by 43\u00a0% to\u00a0>\u00a099\u00a0%. The base simulation (40\u00a0% efficacy) resulted in\u00a0\u223c\u00a028 million total yearly cases in the US, while the most effective vaccine modeled (95\u00a0% efficacy) decreased estimated cases to\u00a0\u223c\u00a022,000.Simulations were performed using an agent-based model of influenza that included varying levels of vaccination efficacy (40-95 % effective). In some simulations, level of infectiousness and\/or length of infectious period in agents with breakthrough infections was also decreased. Impact of increased and decreased levels of vaccine uptake were also modeled. Outcomes included number of symptomatic influenza cases estimated for the US.","508":"We used a stochastic age-structured transmission model to explore a range of intervention scenarios, tracking 66\u00b74 million people aggregated to 186 county-level administrative units in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The four base interventions modelled were school closures, physical distancing, shielding of people aged 70 years or older, and self-isolation of symptomatic cases. We also modelled the combination of these interventions, as well as a programme of intensive interventions with phased lockdown-type restrictions that substantially limited contacts outside of the home for repeated periods. We simulated different triggers for the introduction of interventions, and estimated the impact of varying adherence to interventions across counties. For each scenario, we projected estimated new cases over time, patients requiring inpatient and critical care (ie, admission to the intensive care units [ICU]) treatment, and deaths, and compared the effect of each intervention on the basic reproduction number, R0.We projected a median unmitigated burden of 23 million (95% prediction interval 13-30) clinical cases and 350\u2008000 deaths (170\u2008000-480\u2008000) due to COVID-19 in the UK by December, 2021. We found that the four base interventions were each likely to decrease R0, but not sufficiently to prevent ICU demand from exceeding health service capacity. The combined intervention was more effective at reducing R0, but only lockdown periods were sufficient to bring R0 near or below 1; the most stringent lockdown scenario resulted in a projected 120\u2008000 cases (46\u2008000-700\u2008000) and 50\u2008000 deaths (9300-160\u2008000). Intensive interventions with lockdown periods would need to be in place for a large proportion of the coming year to prevent health-care demand exceeding availability.Medical Research Council.Non-pharmaceutical interventions have been implemented to reduce transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the UK. Projecting the size of an unmitigated epidemic and the potential effect of different control measures has been crucial to support evidence-based policy making during the early stages of the epidemic. This study assesses the potential impact of different control measures for mitigating the burden of COVID-19 in the UK.The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 mean that extreme measures are probably required to bring the epidemic under control and to prevent very large numbers of deaths and an excess of demand on hospital beds, especially those in ICUs.","509":"Maternal antibodies to pertussis can hamper infant immune responses to pertussis vaccines. The effect a maternal tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine booster between 2 consecutive pregnancies is investigated.Levels of pertussis antibodies in all group B siblings at birth were significantly higher than those in their siblings at birth, even as the interval since maternal vaccination increased. Blunting of the infant pertussis vaccine response was detected in group B siblings. We estimated the maximum interval between repeat Tdap vaccine doses in adult women that would yield a beneficial effect for the consecutive infant.A prospective study was conducted in Belgium during 2008-2014 on the kinetics of maternal pertussis antibodies in unvaccinated women and their infants (group A; 86 mother-infant pairs) and in siblings born after the women received Tdap vaccine (group B; 58 mother-infant pairs). Levels of antibody to pertussis toxin, antibody to filamentous hemagglutinin, and antibody to pertactin were measured in maternal blood before and after vaccination and at both deliveries, in cord blood from both siblings, and in infants before and after they received a priming series of acellular pertussis containing vaccines.Prepregnancy Tdap vaccination significantly increases maternal antibody concentrations in consecutive infants. However, similar to the effect of Tdap vaccination during pregnancy, immune responses of later-born infants born to mothers who received a prepregnancy immunization, are blunted.","510":"The international epidemiology of Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV) is challenging to accurately estimate due to limited active surveillance for this rare infectious disease. Prior HDV epidemiological studies have relied on meta-analysis of aggregated and static datasets. These limitations restrict the capacity to actively detect low-level and\/or geographically dispersed changes in the incidence of HDV diagnoses. This study was designed to provide a resource to track and analyze the international HDV epidemiology. Datasets analyzed collectively consisted of >700,000 HBV and >9,000 HDV reported cases ranging between 1999-2020. Datasets mined from government publications were identified for Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Finland, Germany, Macao, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, United Kingdom, and United States. Time series analyses, including Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test, Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and hierarchal clustering, were performed to characterize trends in the HDV timelines. An aggregated prevalence of 2,560 HDV\/HBV100,000 cases (95% CI 180-4940) or 2.56% HDV\/HBV cases was identified, ranging from 0.26% in Canada to 20% in the United States. Structural breaks in the timeline of HDV incidence were identified in 2002, 2012, and 2017, with a significant increase occurring between 2013-2017. Significant increasing trends in reported HDV and HBV cases were observed in 47% and 24% of datasets, respectively. Analyses of the HDV incidence timeline identified four distinct temporal clusters, including Cluster I (Macao, Taiwan), Cluster II (Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Thailand), Cluster III (Bulgaria, Netherlands, New Zealand, United Kingdom, United States) and Cluster IV (Australia, Austria, Canada, Finland, Norway, Sweden). Tracking of HDV and HBV cases on an international scale is essential in defining the global impact of viral hepatitis. Significant disruptions of HDV and HBV epidemiology have been identified. Increased surveillance of HDV is warranted to further define the etiology of the recent breakpoints in the international HDV incidence.","511":"Whilst timely clinical characterisation of infections caused by novel SARS-CoV-2 variants is necessary for evidence-based policy response, individual-level data on infecting variants are typically only available for a minority of patients and settings.Bronner P.

All funders of the ISARIC Clinical Characterisation Group are listed in the appendix.Our analysis, that includes more than 100,000 patients from 28 countries, suggests that in many settings patients hospitalised with Omicron variant infection less often presented with commonly reported symptoms compared to patients infected with pre-Omicron variants. Patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospital after Omicron variant emergence had lower mortality compared to patients admitted during the period when Omicron variant was responsible for only a minority of infections (odds ratio in a mixed-effects logistic regression adjusted for likely confounders, 0.67 [95% confidence interval 0.61-0.75]). Qualitatively similar findings were observed in sensitivity analyses with different assumptions on population-level Omicron variant relative frequencies, and in analyses using available individual-level data on infecting variant for a subset of the study population.Although clinical studies with matching viral genomic information should remain a priority, our approach combining publicly available data on variant frequency and a multi-country clinical characterisation dataset with more than 100,000 records allowed analysis of data from a wide range of settings and novel insights on real-world heterogeneity of COVID-19 presentation and clinical outcome.Here, we propose an innovative approach to study changes in COVID-19 hospital presentation and outcomes after the Omicron variant emergence using publicly available population-level data on variant relative frequency to infer SARS-CoV-2 variants likely responsible for clinical cases. We apply this method to data collected by a large international clinical consortium before and after the emergence of the Omicron variant in different countries.","512":"Existing evidence, mainly from high-income countries, shows children who witness intimate partner violence (IPV) at home are more likely to experience other forms of violence, but very little evidence is available from lower income countries. In this paper we aim to explore whether Ugandan children who witness IPV at home are also more likely to experience other forms of maltreatment, factors associated with witnessing and experiencing violence, and whether any increased risk comes from parents, or others outside the home.Luwero District, Uganda, 2012.Exposure to child maltreatment was measured using the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect Child Abuse Screening Tool-Child Institutional, and 2 questions measured witnessing IPV.In this sample, witnessing IPV almost never occurred in isolation-almost all children who witnessed partner violence also experienced violence themselves. Our results imply that children in Uganda who are exposed to multiple forms of violence may benefit from intervention to mitigate mental health consequences and reduce use of violence. IPV prevention interventions should be considered to reduce child maltreatment. Large numbers of children also experience maltreatment in homes with no partner violence, highlighting the need for interventions to prevent child maltreatment more broadly.NCT01678846, results.3427 non-boarding primary school students, aged about 11-14\u2005years.26% of children reported witnessing IPV, but nearly all of these children had also experienced violence themselves. Only 0.6% of boys and 1.6% of girls had witnessed partner violence and not experienced violence. Increased risk of violence was from parents and also from other perpetrators besides parents. Both girls and boys who witnessed and experienced violence had between 1.66 (95% CI 0.96 to 2.87) and 4.50 (95% CI 1.78 to 11.33) times the odds of reporting mental health difficulties, and 3.23 (95% CI 1.99 to 5.24) and 8.12 (95% CI 5.15 to 12.80) times the odds of using physical or sexual violence themselves.A representative cross-sectional survey of primary schools.","513":"CX3CR1 is present in the airways of pediatric subjects where it may serve as a receptor for RSV infection. Furthermore, CX3CR1 appears to play a mechanistic role in mediating viral infection of pediatric airway epithelial cells in vitro.Low levels of CX3CR1 transcript were often, but not always, expressed in both upper (62%) and lower airways (36%) of pediatric subjects. CX3CR1 transcript and protein expression was detected in epithelial cells of normal human pediatric lung tissues. CX3CR1 expression was readily detected on primary cultures of differentiated pediatric\/infant human lung epithelial cells. RSV demonstrated preferential infection of CX3CR1-positive cells, and blocking CX3CR1\/RSV interaction significantly decreased viral load.Data on the host factors that contribute to infection of young children by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are limited. The human chemokine receptor, CX3CR1, has recently been implicated as an RSV receptor. Here we evaluate a role for CX3CR1 in pediatric lung RSV infections.CX3CR1 transcript levels in the upper and lower pediatric airways were assessed. Tissue localization and cell-specific expression was confirmed using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The role of CX3CR1 in RSV infection was also investigated using a novel physiological model of pediatric epithelial cells.","514":"Genotype 1A hepatovirus A was identified by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and isolated from plasma from a Haitian child with acute undifferentiated febrile illness and malaise.

The impact of systemic insecticides when used to complement existing vector control and drug campaigns is evaluated in three settings-a highly seasonal high-transmission setting, a near-elimination setting with seasonal travel to a high-risk area, and a near-elimination setting in southern Africa.While further research into the safety profile of systemic insecticides is necessary before deployment, models predict that long-lasting systemic insecticides can play a critical role in reducing burden or eliminating malaria in a range of contexts with different target populations, existing malaria control methods, and transmission intensities. Continued investment in lengthening the duration of systemic insecticides and improving their safety profile is needed for this intervention to achieve its fullest potential.At 60% coverage, a single round of long-lasting systemic insecticide with effective duration of at least 60\u00a0days, distributed at the start of the season alongside a seasonal malaria chemoprevention campaign in a high-transmission setting, results in further burden reduction of 30-90% depending on the sub-populations targeted. In a near-elimination setting where transmission is sustained by seasonal travel to a high-risk area, targeting high-risk travellers with systemic insecticide with effective duration of at least 30\u00a0days can result in likely elimination even if intervention coverage is as low as 50%. In near-elimination settings with robust vector control, the addition of a 14-day systemic insecticide alongside an anti-malarial in mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns can decrease the necessary MDA coverage from about 85% to the more easily achievable 65%.While bed nets and insecticide spraying have had significant impact on malaria burden in many endemic regions, outdoor vector feeding and insecticide resistance may ultimately limit their contribution to elimination and control campaigns. Complementary vector control methods such as endectocides or systemic insecticides, where humans or animals are treated with drugs that kill mosquitoes upon ingestion via blood meal, are therefore generating much interest. This work explores the conditions under which long-lasting systemic insecticides would have a substantial impact on transmission and burden.","516":"We provide comprehensive estimates of the CFR across different diarrhoeal pathogens and highlight pathogens for which more studies are needed. The results motivate the need for diarrhoeal interventions and could help prioritize pathogens for vaccine development.We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that reported cases and deaths for 15 enteric pathogens published between 1990 and 2019. The primary outcome was the pathogen-specific CFR stratified by age group, country-specific under-5 mortality rate, setting, study year and rotavirus vaccine introduction status. We developed fixed-effects and multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression models to estimate the pooled CFR overall and for each pathogen, controlling for potential predictors of heterogeneity.A total of 416 studies met review criteria and were included in the analysis. The overall crude CFR for all pathogens was 0.65%, but there was considerable heterogeneity between and within studies. The overall CFR estimated from a random-effects model was 0.04% (95% CI: 0.026%-0.062%), whereas the pathogen-specific CFR estimates ranged from 0% to 2.7%. When pathogens were included as predictors of the CFR in the overall model, the highest and lowest odds ratios were found for enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) [odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20093.0, 95% CI: 1.28-7.07] and rotavirus (OR\u2009=\u20090.23, 95% CI: 0.13-0.39), respectively.Estimates of the relative contribution of different pathogens to all-cause diarrhoea mortality are needed to inform global diarrhoea burden models and prioritize interventions. We aimed to investigate and estimate heterogeneity in the case fatality risk (CFR) of different diarrhoeal pathogens.","517":"The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for robust epidemic forecasts, projecting health burden over short- and medium-term time horizons. Many COVID-19 forecasting models incorporate information on infection transmission, disease progression, and the effects of interventions, but few combine information on how individuals change their behavior based on altruism, fear, risk perception, or personal economic circumstances. Moreover, early models of COVID-19 produced under- and over-estimates, failing to consider the complexity of human responses to disease threat and prevention measures. In this study, we modeled adaptive behavior during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Maryland, USA. The adapted compartmental model incorporates time-varying transmissibility informed on data of environmental factors (e.g., absolute humidity) and behavioral factors (aggregate mobility and perceived risk). We show that humidity and mobility alone did little to explain transmissibility after the first 100 days. Including adaptive behavior in the form of perceived risk as a function of hospitalizations more effectively explained inferred transmissibility and improved out-of-sample fit, demonstrating the model's potential in real-time forecasting. These results demonstrate the importance of incorporating endogenous behavior in models, particularly during a pandemic, to produce more accurate projections, which could lead to more impactful and efficient decision making and resource allocation.","518":"A vulnerability assessment of bridges subjected to hurricane events is beneficial to policy makers prioritizing their critical assets for inspection, maintenance, and retrofit. The proposed parameterized fragility assessment effectively builds a relationship between the hurricane hazard intensity\/bridge parameters and bridge response by implementing a metamodeling approach, and produces a fragility surface which describes the probability of failure in terms of two hazard intensity measures: wind speed and water elevation. These environmental parameters are practical indicators of hazard intensity. The independent variables comprise bridge material\/geometric parameters as well as hazard intensity parameters, and the output parameters represent a binary classification of bridge failure or no-failure states. The proposed approach is used in a vulnerability assessment of Georgia\u0092s coastal bridges using three-dimensional finite-element models. One thousand five hundred statistical samples are generated using a range of parameters determined from common bridge types to study seven metamodels. The results indicate that the random forest model is the most suitable in predicting hurricane-induced failure, and that fragility surfaces are successfully created for two hazard intensity parameters.","519":"Despite identifying El Ni\u00f1o events as a factor in dengue dynamics, predicting the oscillation of global dengue epidemics remains challenging. Here, we investigate climate indicators and worldwide dengue incidence from 1990 to 2019 using climate-driven mechanistic models. We identify a distinct indicator, the Indian Ocean basin-wide (IOBW) index, as representing the regional average of sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical Indian Ocean. IOBW is closely associated with dengue epidemics for both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. The ability of IOBW to predict dengue incidence likely arises as a result of its effect on local temperature anomalies through teleconnections. These findings indicate that the IOBW index can potentially enhance the lead time for dengue forecasts, leading to better-planned and more impactful outbreak responses.","520":"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infection with a global distribution, though it has a greater impact on marginalized rural agricultural and urban communities in developing countries. Kidney injury, which can lead to severe and lethal infections, is the most frequent complication associated with leptospirosis. Novel biomarkers are being studied as tools for assessing kidney injury in different pathological processes to improve early detection. This review aimed to gather information on the use of novel kidney biomarkers for human leptospirosis. A search of the literature was carried out in September 2021 using the parameters \"((kidney) OR (renal) OR (chronic kidney disease) OR (acute kidney injury)) AND ((biomarker) OR (marker)) AND ((Leptospira) OR (leptospirosis))\". The review identified 11 original studies that evaluated the performance of 15 kidney biomarkers related to leptospirosis. Assessment of the evidence for biomarker utility was limited because of the small number of studies and sample sizes. Although some biomarkers were associated with kidney disease, no specific biomarker appeared to be ready for clinical practice, and more research in this field is necessary.","521":"Computational epidemiologists frequently employ large-scale agent-based simulations of human populations to study disease outbreaks and assess intervention strategies. The agents used in such simulations rarely capture the real-world decision-making of human beings. An absence of realistic agent behavior can undermine the reliability of insights generated by such simulations and might make them ill-suited for informing public health policies. In this paper, we address this problem by developing a methodology to create and calibrate an agent decision making model for a large multi-agent simulation, using survey data. Our method optimizes a cost vector associated with the various behaviors to match the behavior distributions observed in a detailed survey of human behaviors during influenza outbreaks. Our approach is a data-driven way of incorporating decision making for agents in large-scale epidemic simulations.","522":"HIV-1 persists in cellular reservoirs that can reignite viremia if antiretroviral therapy (ART) is interrupted. Therefore, insight into the nature of those reservoirs may be revealed from the composition of recrudescing viremia following treatment cessation. A minor population of macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) viruses was identified in a library of recombinant viruses constructed with individual envelope genes that were obtained from plasma of six individuals undergoing analytic treatment interruption (ATI). M-tropic viruses could also be enriched from post-ATI plasma using macrophage-specific (CD14) but not CD4+ T cell-specific (CD3) antibodies, suggesting that M-tropic viruses had a macrophage origin. Molecular clock analysis indicated that the establishment of M-tropic HIV-1 variants predated ATI. Collectively, these data suggest that macrophages are a viral reservoir in HIV-1-infected individuals on effective ART and that M-tropic variants can appear in rebounding viremia when treatment is interrupted. These findings have implications for the design of curative strategies for HIV-1.","523":"), underlie several natural timer circuits involved in processes such as cell cycle transitions, T\u00a0cell activation, and departure from the pluripotent state.

We found the EWMA method most suited for detecting changes in imaging utilization.Systematic, automated methods for monitoring physician performance are necessary if outlying behavior is to be detected promptly and acted on. In the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC), we evaluated several statistical process control (SPC) methods to determine the sensitivity and ease of interpretation for assessing adherence to imaging guidelines for patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer.EWMA had the lowest ARL and was able to detect changes significantly earlier than the other SPC methodologies (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The p-chart had the highest ARL and thus detected changes slowest (p\u2009<\u20090.001). EWMA and p-charts were easier to interpret graphically than CUSUM methods due to their ability to display historical imaging rates.Following dissemination of imaging guidelines within the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) for men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer, MUSIC set a target of imaging <\u200910% of patients for which bone scan is not indicated. We compared four SPC methods using Monte Carlo simulation: p-chart, weighted binomial CUSUM, Bernoulli cumulative sum (CUSUM), and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA). We simulated non-indicated bone scan rates ranging from 5.9% (within target) to 11.4% (above target) for a representative MUSIC practice. Sensitivity was determined using the average run length (ARL), the time taken to signal a change. We then plotted actual non-indicated bone scan rates for a representative MUSIC practice using each SPC method to qualitatively assess graphical interpretation.","525":"Dengue viruses (DENV) are endemic in the US territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the US Virgin Islands, with focal outbreaks also reported in the states of Florida and Hawaii. However, little is known about the intensity of dengue virus transmission over time and how dengue viruses have shaped the level of immunity in these populations, despite the importance of understanding how and why levels of immunity against dengue may change over time. These changes need to be considered when responding to future outbreaks and enacting dengue management strategies, such as guiding vaccine deployment. We used catalytic models fitted to case surveillance data stratified by age from the ArboNET national arboviral surveillance system to reconstruct the history of recent dengue virus transmission in Puerto Rico, American Samoa, US Virgin Islands, Florida, Hawaii, and Guam. We estimated average annual transmission intensity (i.e., force of infection) of DENV between 2010 and 2019 and the level of seroprevalence by age group in each population. We compared models and found that assuming all reported cases are secondary infections generally fit the surveillance data better than assuming all cases are primary infections. Using the secondary case model, we found that force of infection was highly heterogeneous between jurisdictions and over time within jurisdictions, ranging from 0.00003 (95% CrI: 0.00002-0.0004) in Florida to 0.08 (95% CrI: 0.044-0.14) in American Samoa during the 2010-2019 period. For early 2020, we estimated that seropositivity in 10 year-olds ranged from 0.09% (0.02%-0.54%) in Florida to 56.3% (43.7%-69.3%) in American Samoa. In the absence of serological data, age-specific case notification data collected through routine surveillance combined with mathematical modeling are powerful tools to monitor arbovirus circulation, estimate the level of population immunity, and design dengue management strategies.","526":"Subjects were 2020 workers ever employed in the facility during 1963-2014.

Among indexes, 77 (20.8%) were sexual health influencers and 294 (79.2%) were noninfluencers. On average, each sexual health influencer successfully encouraged 1.66 alters to self-test compared to 0.51 alters encouraged by each noninfluencer (adjusted rate ratio 2.07, 95% CI 1.59-2.69). More sexual health influencers disclosed their sexual orientation (80.5% vs 67.3%, P=.02) and were community-based organization volunteers (18.2% vs 2.7%, P<.001) than noninfluencers. More alters of sexual health influencers came from a rural area (45.5% vs 23.8%, P<.001), had below-college education (57.7% vs 37.1%, P<.001), and had multiple casual male sexual partners in the past 6 months (25.2% vs 11.9%, P<.001).Social network-based strategies can expand HIV\/syphilis self-tests among men who have sex with men (MSM). Sexual health influencers are individuals who are particularly capable of spreading information about HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) within their social networks. However, it remains unknown whether a sexual health influencer can encourage their peers to self-test for HIV\/syphilis.Being a sexual health influencer was associated with encouraging more alters with less testing access to self-test for HIV\/syphilis. Sexual health influencers can be engaged as seeds to expand HIV\/syphilis testing coverage.The aims of this study were to examine the impact of MSM sexual health influencers on improving HIV\/syphilis self-test uptake within their social networks compared to that of nonsexual health influencers.In Zhuhai, China, men 16 years or older, born biologically male, who reported ever having had sex with a man, and applying for HIV\/syphilis self-tests were enrolled online as indexes and encouraged to distribute self-tests to individuals (alters) in their social network. Indexes scoring >3 on a sexual health influencer scale were considered to be sexual health influencers (Cronbach \u03b1=.87). The primary outcome was the mean number of alters encouraged to test per index for sexual health influencers compared with the number encouraged by noninfluencers.","528":"We used data from 12701 respondents participating in a Belgian survey in 2022. Correlation coefficients between GHQ-12 and EQ-5D-5L were calculated at both the aggregate and item levels. Multidimensional scaling (MDS), exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and regression models were performed to investigate the underlying constructs that are associated with the items.To the best of our knowledge, we present the first comparison of items and underlying constructs of GHQ-12 and EQ-5D-5L. The results showed that GHQ-12 can only partially predict the responses of EQ-5D-5L and the two instruments measure different constructs. Researchers should carefully consider conceptual legitimacy while applying the mapping technique and consider sensitivity analyses for the mapping estimates.To explore the internal constructs of the concepts being measured by EQ-5D-5L (a health-related quality of life measure that can produce preference-based utility values) and the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12, a mental well-being measure), and to understand to what extent the items of EQ-5D-5L and GHQ-12 associate with each other.Despite a moderate correlation (0.39) between the EQ-5D-5L and GHQ-12 total scores, only a trivial or weak correlation (<0.3) was observed between the first four EQ-5D-5L items and any GHQ-12 item. MDS and EFA showed the first four EQ-5D-5L dimensions were clustered together with EQ-VAS, positively-phrased GHQ-12 items were close to each other, while EQ-Anxiety\/Depression and negatively-phrased GHQ-12 items were grouped with overall life satisfaction. In the regression models, not all GHQ-12 items had a significant coefficient to predict EQ-5D-5L responses.","529":" = 0.001). COVID-19 infection imposes a substantial disease burden, even in patients with non-severe disease.

However, additional interventions, adapted to country-specific tuberculosis epidemiology and health systems, are needed to reach the post-2015 End TB Strategy targets at country level.Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.11 independently developed mathematical models of tuberculosis transmission projected the epidemiological impact of currently available tuberculosis interventions for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in China, India, and South Africa. Models were calibrated with data on tuberculosis incidence and mortality in 2012. Representatives from national tuberculosis programmes and the advocacy community provided distinct country-specific intervention scenarios, which included screening for symptoms, active case finding, and preventive therapy.The post-2015 End TB Strategy proposes targets of 50% reduction in tuberculosis incidence and 75% reduction in mortality from tuberculosis by 2025. We aimed to assess whether these targets are feasible in three high-burden countries with contrasting epidemiology and previous programmatic achievements.Aggressive scale-up of any single intervention scenario could not achieve the post-2015 End TB Strategy targets in any country. However, the models projected that, in the South Africa national tuberculosis programme scenario, a combination of continuous isoniazid preventive therapy for individuals on antiretroviral therapy, expanded facility-based screening for symptoms of tuberculosis at health centres, and improved tuberculosis care could achieve a 55% reduction in incidence (range 31-62%) and a 72% reduction in mortality (range 64-82%) compared with 2015 levels. For India, and particularly for China, full scale-up of all interventions in tuberculosis-programme performance fell short of the 2025 targets, despite preventing a cumulative 3\u00b74 million cases. The advocacy scenarios illustrated the high impact of detecting and treating latent tuberculosis.","531":"Comprehensive surveillance systems are the key to provide accurate data for effective modeling. Traditional symptom-based case surveillance has been joined with recent genomic, serologic, and environment surveillance to provide more integrated disease surveillance systems. A major gap in comprehensive disease surveillance is to accurately monitor potential population behavioral changes in real-time. Population-wide behaviors such as compliance with various interventions and vaccination acceptance significantly influence and drive the overall epidemic dynamics in the society. Original infoveillance utilizes online query data (e.g., Google and Wikipedia search of a specific content topic such as an epidemic) and later focuses on large volumes of online discourse data about the from social media platforms and further augments epidemic modeling. It mainly uses number of posts to approximate public awareness of the disease, and further compares with observed epidemic dynamics for better projection. The current COVID-19 pandemic shows that there is an urgency to further harness the rich, detailed content and sentiment information, which can provide more accurate and granular information on public awareness and perceptions toward multiple aspects of the disease, especially various interventions. In this perspective paper, we describe a novel conceptual analytical framework of content and sentiment infoveillance (CSI) and integration with epidemic modeling. This CSI framework includes data retrieval and pre-processing; information extraction via natural language processing to identify and quantify detailed time, location, content, and sentiment information; and integrating infoveillance with common epidemic modeling techniques of both mechanistic and data-driven methods. CSI complements and significantly enhances current epidemic models for more informed decision by integrating behavioral aspects from detailed, instantaneous infoveillance from massive social media data.","532":" macaques and implicate anti-Env antibodies in containment of SIV infection.","533":"In response to continuing legacies of colonialism, there is increasing recognition of the need to decolonise various fields of research and practice, including within work on violence against women and girls (VAWG). An emerging body of literature critiques how VAWG is framed, how prevention and response interventions may be imposed on communities as part of White Saviourism, and the existence of hierarchical approaches to data collection, analysis and interpretation. This scoping review is the first known attempt to describe global published and grey literature on colonialism and decolonisation within VAWG research and programming. We conducted an extensive search across databases and search engines including research studies, reports, commentaries and blogs, and identified 55 sources that focused on VAWG and related to the legacy of colonialism and\/or decolonial approaches within the field. Included literature discussed the role of colonialism in shaping VAWG, referenced decolonial approaches to respond to VAWG and identified five key recommendations for VAWG research and practice: 1. Consider the context and power hierarchies within which VAWG occurs; 2. Incorporate community resources and perspectives into efforts to end VAWG; 3. Use methods and approaches to researching VAWG that centre perspectives and lived experience of communities; 4. Shift VAWG funding to local actors and ensure VAWG funding streams are more responsive to local needs and realities; and 5. Ensure local, contextually-relevant framings of feminisms inform decolonising of VAWG. We conclude that shifting towards a bottom-up approach to decolonising VAWG research and programming is essential to prevent decolonisation from being reduced to a buzzword. While literature explored the use of specific methods to decolonise research on VAWG, researchers need broader strategies to embed a decolonial perspective throughout the research process, transcending mere methodological adaptations. There is a need for VAWG research and programming to scrutinise structural inequities, particularly acknowledging how colonial practices entrenched within wider societal power structures impact the field of VAWG.","534":"In the United States, estimates of excess deaths attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic have consistently surpassed reported COVID-19 death counts. Excess deaths reported to non-COVID-19 natural causes may represent unrecognized COVID-19 deaths, deaths caused by pandemic health care interruptions, and\/or deaths from the pandemic's socioeconomic impacts. The geographic and temporal distribution of these deaths may help to evaluate which explanation is most plausible. We developed a Bayesian hierarchical model to produce monthly estimates of excess natural-cause mortality for US counties over the first 30 mo of the pandemic. From March 2020 through August 2022, 1,194,610 excess natural-cause deaths occurred nationally [90% PI (Posterior Interval): 1,046,000 to 1,340,204]. A total of 162,886 of these excess natural-cause deaths (90% PI: 14,276 to 308,480) were not reported to COVID-19. Overall, 15.8 excess deaths were reported to non-COVID-19 natural causes for every 100 reported COVID-19 deaths. This number was greater in nonmetropolitan counties (36.0 deaths), the West (Rocky Mountain states: 31.6 deaths; Pacific states: 25.5 deaths), and the South (East South Central states: 26.0 deaths; South Atlantic states: 25.0 deaths; West South Central states: 24.2 deaths). In contrast, reported COVID-19 death counts surpassed estimates of excess natural-cause deaths in metropolitan counties in the New England and Middle Atlantic states. Increases in reported COVID-19 deaths correlated temporally with increases in excess deaths reported to non-COVID-19 natural causes in the same and\/or prior month. This suggests that many excess deaths reported to non-COVID-19 natural causes during the first 30 mo of the pandemic in the United States were unrecognized COVID-19 deaths.","535":"A foundational paradigm in biological and Earth sciences is that our planet is divided into distinct ecoregions and biomes demarking unique assemblages of species. This notion has profoundly influenced scientific research and environmental policy. Given recent advances in technology and data availability, however, we are now poised to ask whether ecoregions meaningfully delimit biological communities. Using over 200 million observations of plants, animals and fungi we show compelling evidence that ecoregions delineate terrestrial biodiversity patterns. We achieve this by testing two competing hypotheses: the sharp-transition hypothesis, positing that ecoregion borders divide differentiated biotic communities; and the gradual-transition hypothesis, proposing instead that species turnover is continuous and largely independent of ecoregion borders. We find strong support for the sharp-transition hypothesis across all taxa, although adherence to ecoregion boundaries varies across taxa. Although plant and vertebrate species are tightly linked to sharp ecoregion boundaries, arthropods and fungi show weaker affiliations to this set of ecoregion borders. Our results highlight the essential value of ecological data for setting conservation priorities and reinforce the importance of protecting habitats across as many ecoregions as possible. Specifically, we conclude that ecoregion-based conservation planning can guide investments that simultaneously protect species-, community- and ecosystem-level biodiversity, key for securing Earth's life support systems into the future.","536":"Simulation modeling can help explore the effects of strategies on HRQoL while also demonstrating the dynamic interactions between its key components, offering a powerful tool to investigate aspects of HRQoL that are difficult to assess in real-world settings.Model captures key interactions within HRQoL, providing a nuanced analysis of its continuous temporal dynamics, particularly physical well-being, psychological well-being, tumor burden, receipt and efficacy of treatment, side effects, and their management. Model analysis shows reducing infusion delays enhanced HRQoL across all four metrics. While enhanced social support improved the first three metrics for patients who received treatment, it did not change durability of the peak.Understanding health-related quality of life (HRQoL) dynamics is essential for assessing and improving treatment experiences; however, clinical and observational studies struggle to capture their full complexity. We use simulation modeling and the case of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell therapy-a type of cancer immunotherapy that can prolong survival, but carries life-threatening risks-to study HRQoL dynamics.We developed an exploratory system dynamics model with mathematical equations and parameter values informed by literature and expert insights.\u00a0We refined its feedback structure and evaluated its dynamic behavior through iterative interviews. Model simulated HRQoL from treatment approval through six months post-infusion. Two strategies-reducing the delay to infusion and enhancing social support-were incorporated into the model. To dynamically evaluate the effect of these strategies, we developed four metrics: post-treatment HRQoL decline, recovery time to pre-treatment HRQoL, post-treatment HRQoL peak, and durability of the peak.","537":"These undetected cases potentially resulted in multiple chains of human-to-human transmission outside mainland China.","538":"While our previous work has shown that replacing existing vaccines with thermostable vaccines can relieve bottlenecks in vaccine supply chains and thus increase vaccine availability, the question remains whether this benefit would outweigh the additional cost of thermostable formulations.Using HERMES simulation models of the vaccine supply chains for the Republic of Benin, the state of Bihar (India), and Niger, we simulated replacing different existing vaccines with thermostable formulations and determined the resulting clinical and economic impact. Costs measured included the costs of vaccines, logistics, and disease outcomes averted.Replacing a particular vaccine with a thermostable version yielded cost savings in many cases even when charging a price premium (two or three times the current vaccine price). For example, replacing the current pentavalent vaccine with a thermostable version without increasing the vaccine price saved from $366 to $10,945 per 100 members of the vaccine's target population. Doubling the vaccine price still resulted in cost savings that ranged from $300 to $10,706, and tripling the vaccine price resulted in cost savings from $234 to $10,468. As another example, a thermostable rotavirus vaccine (RV) at its current (year) price saved between $131 and $1065. Doubling and tripling the thermostable rotavirus price resulted in cost savings ranging from $102 to $936 and $73 to $808, respectively. Switching to thermostable formulations was highly cost-effective or cost-effective in most scenarios explored.Medical cost and productivity savings could outweigh even significant price premiums charged for thermostable formulations of vaccines, providing support for their use.","539":"Among 845 patients with culture-positive pulmonary tuberculosis in Haiti, 65 (7.7%) had Hr-TB based on the Genotype MTBDRplus molecular assay. Age < 20 years was significantly associated with Hr-TB (odds ratio, 2.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.14, 4.70; P = .015). Thirteen (20%) isoniazid-resistant isolates were found in 5 putative transmission clusters based on a single nucleotide polymorphism distance of \u2264 5. No patients in these transmission clusters were members of the same household. Adolescents are at higher risk for Hr-TB. Strains of isoniazid-resistant M tuberculosis are actively circulating in Haiti and transmission is likely occurring in community settings.We studied the molecular epidemiology of Hr-TB among all patients diagnosed with culture-positive pulmonary tuberculosis between January 1 and June 30, 2017, at an urban referral tuberculosis clinic in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from the electronic medical record. Archived diagnostic Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were tested for genotypic and phenotypic isoniazid resistance using the Genotype MTBDRplus assay (Hain, Nehren, Germany) and culture-based testing, respectively. All isoniazid-resistant isolates and a randomly selected subset of isoniazid-susceptible isolates underwent whole-genome sequencing to confirm the presence of mutations associated with isoniazid resistance, to validate use of Genotype MTBDRplus in this population, and to identify potential transmission links between isoniazid-resistant isolates.Isoniazid-resistant, rifampin-susceptible tuberculosis (Hr-TB) is associated with poor treatment outcomes and higher rates of acquisition of further drug resistance during treatment. Due to a lack of widespread diagnostics, Hr-TB is frequently undetected and its epidemiology is incompletely understood.","540":"Selection against migrants is key to maintaining genetic differences between populations linked by dispersal. However, migrants may mitigate fitness costs by proactively choosing among available habitats, or by phenotypic plasticity. We previously reported that a reciprocal transplant of lake and stream stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) found little support for divergent selection. Here, we revisit that experiment to test whether phenotypic plasticity in gene expression may have helped migrants adjust to unfamiliar habitats. We measured gene expression profiles in stickleback via TagSeq and tested whether migrants between lake and stream habitats exhibited a plastic response to their new environment that allowed them to converge on the expression profile of adapted natives. We report extensive gene expression differences between genetically divergent lake and stream stickleback, despite gene flow. But for many genes, expression was highly plastic. Fish transplanted into the adjoining habitat partially converged on the expression profile typical of natives from their new habitat. This suggests that expression plasticity may soften the impact of migration. Nonetheless, lake and stream fish differed in survival rates and parasite infection rates in our study, implying that expression plasticity is not fast or extensive enough to fully homogenize fish performance.","541":"At endline, 53% of control group students with no functional difficulties reported violence from peers or school staff, versus 84% of students with a disability.

Forty-two primary schools in Luwero District, Uganda, were randomly assigned to receive the Good School Toolkit for 18 months, or to a waitlisted control group. The primary outcome was past week physical violence from school staff, measured by primary 5, 6, and 7 students' (aged 11-14 years) self-reports using the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect Child Abuse Screening Tool-Child Institutional.

Maternal vaccines, birth-dose extended half-life monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and pediatric vaccines are under development for prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in young children. We analyzed the health and economic impact of RSV interventions used alone or in combinations in Mali. We modeled age-specific and season-specific risks of RSV LRTI in children through three years, using WHO Preferred Product Characteristics and data generated in Mali. Health outcomes included RSV LRTI cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). We identified the optimal combination of products across a range of scenarios. We found that mAb delivered at birth could avert 878 DALYs per birth cohort at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $597 per DALY averted compared to no intervention if the product were available at $1 per dose. Combining mAb with pediatric vaccine administered at 10\/14 weeks, 1947 DALYs would be prevented. The ICER of this combination strategy is $1514 per DALY averted compared to mAb alone. Incorporating parameter uncertainty, mAb alone is likely to be optimal from the societal perspective at efficacy against RSV LRTI above 66%. The optimal strategy was sensitive to economic considerations, including product prices and willingness-to-pay for DALYs. For example, the combination of mAb and pediatric vaccine would be optimal from the government perspective at a willingness-to-pay above $775 per DALY. Maternal vaccine alone or in combination with other interventions was never the optimal strategy, even for high vaccine efficacy. The same was true for pediatric vaccine administered at 6\/7 months. At prices comparable to existing vaccine products, extended half-life RSV mAbs would be impactful and efficient components of prevention strategies in LMICs such as Mali.","544":"The SEVI showed a moderate to strong relationship with case rates in the validation dataset across the whole study period, and for every intervening period studied except early in the pandemic when testing was highly selective. The SEVI was more strongly correlated with case rates than any of its domains (rs 0\u00b759 95% CI 0.57-0.62) and outperformed an existing MSOA-level vulnerability index.

Multivariable linear regression was used to build a parsimonious model of vulnerability (static socio-ecological vulnerability index, SEVI) in 60% of MSOAs, and retained variables were used to construct two simple indices. Assuming a monotonic relationship between indices and outcomes, Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between the SEVI and cumulative COVID-19 case rates at MSOA level in the remaining 40% of MSOAs over periods both during and out with national lockdowns. Similarly, a novel vaccine hesitancy index (VHI) was constructed using population characteristics aligned with factors identified by an Office for National Statistics (ONS) survey analysis. The relationship between the VHI and vaccine coverage in people aged 12+years (as of 2021-06-24) was determined using Spearman correlation. The indices were split into quintiles, and MSOAs within the highest vulnerability and vaccine hesitancy quintiles were mapped.Population characteristics can be used to infer vulnerability of communities to COVID-19, or to the likelihood of high levels of vaccine hesitancy. Communities harder hit by the virus, or at risk of being so, stand to benefit from greater resource allocation than their population size alone would suggest. This study reports a simple but efficacious method of ranking small areas of England by relative characteristics that are linked with COVID-19 vulnerability and vaccine hesitancy.The indices presented offer an efficacious way of identifying geographical disparities in COVID-19 risk, thus helping focus resources according to need.Funder: Integrated Covid Hub North East.","545":"CEPs and CEACs\/CEAF could falsely imply the lack of sufficient evidence to identify the optimal option if cost and effect estimates have high variance, are correlated across alternatives, or when alternatives have similar cost-effectiveness ratios. The augmented NMB lines and ELCs can correctly identify the option with the highest expected NMB and communicate the potential benefit of resolving uncertainties. Like ELCs, the augmented NMB lines provide information about the value of resolving parameter uncertainties, but augmented NMB lines may be easier to interpret for decision makers.We considered 4 hypothetical decision problems representing scenarios with high variance or correlated cost and effect estimates and alternatives with similar cost-effectiveness ratios. We used these decision problems to demonstrate the limitations of existing methods and the potential of augmented NMB lines to resolve these issues.The results of cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) when the cost and effect estimates of alternatives are uncertain are commonly presented using cost-effectiveness planes (CEPs), cost-effectiveness acceptability curves\/frontier (CEACs\/CEAF), and expected loss curves (ELCs).Although currently not often used, net monetary benefit (NMB) lines could present the results of cost-effectiveness to identify the alternative with the highest expected NMB values given the current level of uncertainty. Furthermore, NMB lines can be augmented to 1) show metrics of value of information, which measure the value of additional research to reduce or eliminate the decision uncertainty, and 2) display the confidence intervals along the NMB lines to ensure that NMB values are estimated accurately using a sufficiently large number of parameter samples.Using several decision problems, we demonstrate the limitation of existing methods to present the results of CEAs under parameter uncertainty and how augmented NMB lines could resolve these issues.Our analysis supports recommending augmented NMB lines as an important method to present the results of CEA under uncertainty since they 1) correctly identify the alternative with the highest expected NMB value given the current evidence, 2) provide information about the potential value of additional research to improve the decision by reducing or resolving uncertainty in model parameters, 3) assist the analysis to visually ensure that enough parameter samples are used to estimate the expected NMB of alternatives, and 4) are easier to interpret for decision makers compared with other methods.Methods to present the result of cost-effectiveness analyses under parameter uncertainty include cost-effectiveness planes (CEPs), cost-effectiveness acceptability curves\/frontier (CEACs\/CEAF), expected loss curves (ELCs), and net monetary benefit (NMB) lines. We describe how NMB lines can be augmented to present NMB values that could be achieved by reducing or resolving parameter uncertainty. We evaluated the ability of these methods to correctly 1) identify the alternative with the highest expected NMB and 2) communicate the magnitude of parameter and decision uncertainty.Our analysis supports recommending the augment NMB lines as an important method to present the results of economic evaluation studies under parameter uncertainty.","546":"La Crosse encephalitis is a viral disease that has emerged in new locations across the Appalachian region of the United States. Conventional wisdom suggests that ongoing emergence of La Crosse virus (LACV) could stem from the invasive Asian tiger (Aedes albopictus) mosquito. Efforts to prove this, however, are complicated by the numerous transmission routes and species interactions involved in LACV dynamics. To analyze LACV transmission by Asian tiger mosquitoes, we constructed epidemiologic models. These models accurately predict empirical infection rates. They do not, however, support the hypothesis that Asian tiger mosquitoes are responsible for the recent emergence of LACV at new foci. Consequently, we conclude that other factors, including different invasive mosquitoes, changes in climate variables, or changes in wildlife densities, should be considered as alternative explanations for recent increases in La Crosse encephalitis.","547":"Host demography can alter the dynamics of infectious disease. In the case of perfectly immunizing infections, observations of strong sensitivity to demographic variation have been mechanistically explained through analysis of the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model that assumes lifelong immunity following recovery from infection. When imperfect immunity is incorporated into this framework via the susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) model, with individuals regaining full susceptibility following recovery, we show that rapid loss of immunity is predicted to buffer populations against the effects of demographic change. However, this buffering is contrary to the dependence on demography recently observed for partially immunizing infections such as rotavirus and respiratory syncytial virus. We show that this discrepancy arises from a key simplification embedded in the SIR(S) framework, namely that the potential for differential immune responses to repeat exposures is ignored. We explore the minimum additional immunological information that must be included to reflect the range of observed dependencies on demography. We show that including partial protection and lower transmission following primary infection is sufficient to capture more realistic reduced levels of buffering, in addition to changes in epidemic timing, across a range of partially and fully immunizing infections. Furthermore, our results identify key variables in this relationship, including R0. ","548":"Many public health challenges are characterized by complexity that reflects the dynamic systems in which they occur. Such systems involve multiple interdependent factors, actors, and sectors that influence health, and are a primary driver of challenges of insufficient implementation, sustainment, and scale of evidence-based public health interventions. Implementation science frameworks have been developed to help embed evidence-based interventions in diverse settings and identify key factors that facilitate or hinder implementation. These frameworks are largely static in that they do not explain the nature and dynamics of interrelationships among the identified determinants, nor how those determinants might change over time. Furthermore, most implementation science frameworks are top-down, deterministic, and linear, leaving critical gaps in understanding of both how to intervene on determinants of successful implementation and how to scale evidence-based solutions. Design thinking and systems science offer methods for transforming this problem-oriented paradigm into one that is solution-oriented. This article describes these two approaches and how they can be integrated into implementation science strategies to promote implementation, sustainment, and scaling of public health innovation, ultimately resulting in transformative systems changes that improve population health.","549":"There is evidence of an association between outdoor temperature and fatal police shootings in the United States, particularly when the victims were reported as armed.

Meanwhile, media reports of aggravating events generally preceded temporary transmission increases in both countries. Given these preliminary findings, we conclude that media reported events could potentially be incorporated into future epidemic modeling efforts to improve mid-outbreak case projections.

In this study, the age-specific FOI of FIV in pumas was estimated from prevalence data, and the evidence for disease-associated mortality was assessed.We fitted candidate models to FIV prevalence data and adopted a maximum likelihood method to estimate parameter values in each model. The models with the best fit were determined to infer the most likely FOI curves. We applied this strategy for female and male pumas from California, Colorado, and Florida.When splitting the data by sex and area, our FOI modeling revealed no evidence of disease-associated mortality in any population. Both sex and location were found to influence the FOI, which was generally higher for male pumas than for females. For female pumas at all sites, and male pumas from California and Colorado, the FOI did not vary with puma age, implying FIV transmission can happen throughout life; this result supports the idea that transmission can occur from mothers to cubs and also throughout adult life. For Florida males, the FOI was a decreasing function of puma age, indicating an increased risk of infection in the early years, and a decreased risk at older ages.This research provides critical insight into pathogen transmission and impact in a secretive and solitary carnivore. Our findings shed light on the debate on whether FIV causes mortality in wild felids like puma, and our approach may be adopted for other diseases and species. The methodology we present can be used for identifying likely transmission routes of a pathogen and also estimating any disease-associated mortality, both of which can be difficult to establish for wildlife diseases in particular.","553":"Subgroup identification (clustering) is an important problem in biomedical research. Gene expression profiles are commonly utilized to define subgroups. Longitudinal gene expression profiles might provide additional information on disease progression than what is captured by baseline profiles alone. Therefore, subgroup identification could be more accurate and effective with the aid of longitudinal gene expression data. However, existing statistical methods are unable to fully utilize these data for patient clustering. In this article, we introduce a novel clustering method in the Bayesian setting based on longitudinal gene expression profiles. This method, called BClustLonG, adopts a linear mixed-effects framework to model the trajectory of genes over time, while clustering is jointly conducted based on the regression coefficients obtained from all genes. In order to account for the correlations among genes and alleviate the high dimensionality challenges, we adopt a factor analysis model for the regression coefficients. The Dirichlet process prior distribution is utilized for the means of the regression coefficients to induce clustering. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that BClustLonG has improved performance over other clustering methods. When applied to a dataset of severely injured (burn or trauma) patients, our model is able to identify interesting subgroups.

Here, we show that a single cell image can be used to discriminate its migration behavior by analyzing a large number of cell migration data in vitro. We analyzed a large number of two-dimensional cell migration images over time and found that the cell shape variation space has only six dimensions, and migration behavior can be determined by the coordinates of a single cell image in this 6-dimensional shape-space. We further show that this is possible because persistent cell migration is characterized by spatial-temporally coordinated protrusion and contraction, and a distribution signature in the shape-space. Our findings provide a quantitative underpinning for using cell morphology to differentiate cell dynamical behavior.","555":"A better understanding of persistence-infectivity trade-offs and associated dynamics can improve our ecological understanding of environmentally transmitted pathogens, as well as our risk assessment and disease control strategies.We use a transmission modeling framework to develop an infectious disease model with biphasic pathogen decay. We take a differential algebra approach to assessing model identifiability, calculate basic reproduction numbers by the next generation method, and use simulation to explore model dynamics.For both long and short time-scales, we demonstrate that epidemic-potential-preserving trade-offs have implications for epidemic dynamics: less infectious, more persistent pathogens cause epidemics to progress more slowly than more infectious, less persistent (labile) pathogens, even when the overall risk is the same. Using identifiability analysis, we show that the usual disease surveillance data does not sufficiently inform these underlying pathogen population dynamics, even when combined with basic environmental monitoring data. However, risk could be indirectly ascertained by developing methods to separately monitor labile and persistent subpopulations. Alternatively, determining the relative infectivity of persistent pathogen subpopulations and the rates of phenotypic conversion will help ascertain how much disease risk is associated with the long tails of biphasic decay.Human pathogens transmitted through environmental pathways are subject to stress and pressures outside of the host. These pressures may cause pathogen pathovars to diverge in their environmental persistence and their infectivity on an evolutionary time-scale. On a shorter time-scale, a single-genotype pathogen population may display wide variation in persistence times and exhibit biphasic decay.","556":"Climate change is likely to profoundly modulate the burden of infectious diseases. However, attributing health impacts to a changing climate requires being able to associate changes in infectious disease incidence with the potentially complex influences of climate. This aim is further complicated by nonlinear feedbacks inherent in the dynamics of many infections, driven by the processes of immunity and transmission. Here, we detail the mechanisms by which climate drivers can shape infectious disease incidence, from direct effects on vector life history to indirect effects on human susceptibility, and detail the scope of variation available with which to probe these mechanisms. We review approaches used to evaluate and quantify associations between climate and infectious disease incidence, discuss the array of data available to tackle this question, and detail remaining challenges in understanding the implications of climate change for infectious disease incidence. We point to areas where synthesis between approaches used in climate science and infectious disease biology provide potential for progress.","557":" (the only licensed dengue vaccine to date) increases the risk of severe illness among seronegative recipients, the World Health Organization has recommended screening individuals for their serostatus prior to vaccination. To decide whether and how to carry out screening, it is necessary to estimate the transmission intensity of dengue and to understand the performance of the screening method. In this study, we inferred the annual force of infection (FOI; a measurement of transmission intensity) of dengue virus in three locations in Vietnam: An Giang (FOI = 0.04 for the below 10 years age group and FOI = 0.20 for the above 10 years age group), Ho Chi Minh City (FOI = 0.12) and Quang Ngai (FOI = 0.05). In addition, we show that using a quantitative approach to immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels (measured by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) can help to distinguish individuals with primary exposures (primary seropositive) from those with secondary exposures (secondary seropositive). We found that primary-seropositive individuals-the main targets of the vaccine-tend to have a lower IgG level, and, thus, they have a higher chance of being misclassified as seronegative than secondary-seropositive cases. However, screening performance can be improved by incorporating patient age and transmission intensity into the interpretation of IgG levels.","558":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections have spilled over from humans to companion and wild animals since the inception of the global COVID-19 pandemic. However, whole genome sequencing data of the viral genomes that infect non-human animal species has been scant. Here, we detected and sequenced a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (AY.3) in fecal samples from an 11-year-old domestic house cat previously exposed to an owner who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Molecular testing of two fecal samples collected 7 days apart yielded relatively high levels of viral RNA. Sequencing of the feline-derived viral genomes showed the two to be identical, and differing by between 4 and 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms in pairwise comparisons to human-derived lineage AY.3 sequences collected in the same geographic area and time period. However, several mutations unique to the feline samples reveal their divergence from this cohort on phylogenetic analysis. These results demonstrate continued spillover infections of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants that threaten human and animal health, as well as highlight the importance of collecting fecal samples when testing for SARS-CoV-2 in animals. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first published case of a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in a domestic cat in the United States.","559":"For persons aged \u22656 years with LTBI, the overall reactivation rate was estimated as 0.072 (95% uncertainty interval: 0.047, 0.12) per 100 person-years. Estimated reactivation rates declined with age. Compared to the overall population, estimated reactivation rates were higher for persons with diabetes (adjusted rate ratio [aRR] = 1.6 [1.5, 1.7]), end-stage renal disease (aRR = 9.8 [5.4, 19]), and HIV (aRR = 12 [10, 13]).In the United States, over 80% of tuberculosis (TB) disease cases are estimated to result from reactivation of latent TB infection (LTBI) acquired more than 2 years previously (\"reactivation TB\"). We estimated reactivation TB rates for the US population with LTBI, overall, by age, sex, race-ethnicity, and US-born status, and for selected comorbidities (diabetes, end-stage renal disease, and HIV).In our study, individuals with LTBI faced small, non-negligible risks of reactivation TB. Risks were elevated for individuals with medical comorbidities that weaken immune function.We collated nationally representative data for 2011-2012. Reactivation TB incidence was based on TB cases reported to the National TB Surveillance System that were attributed to LTBI reactivation. Person-years at risk of reactivation TB were calculated using interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) positivity from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, published values for interferon-gamma release assay sensitivity and specificity, and population estimates from the American Community Survey.","560":"We characterized the changes to transmission and epidemic trajectories among children and adults in a spatial context before, during, and after the winter holidays among aggregated physician medical claims in the United States from 2001 to 2009 and among synthetic data simulated from a deterministic, age-specific spatial metapopulation model.Winter holidays reduced influenza transmission and delayed the trajectory of influenza season epidemics. The holiday period was marked by a shift in the relative risk of disease from children toward adults. Model results indicated that holidays delayed epidemic peaks and synchronized incidence across locations, and that contact reductions from school closures, rather than age-specific mixing and travel, produced these observed holiday influenza dynamics.Winter holidays delay seasonal influenza epidemic peaks and shift disease risk toward adults because of changes in contact patterns. These findings may inform targeted influenza information and vaccination campaigns during holiday periods.The seasonality of influenza is thought to vary according to environmental factors and human behavior. During winter holidays, potential disease-causing contact and travel deviate from typical patterns. We aim to understand these changes on age-specific and spatial influenza transmission.","561":"Among the four groups of HIV-1 (M, N, O, and P), HIV-1M alone is pandemic and has rapidly expanded across the world. However, why HIV-1M has caused a devastating pandemic while the other groups remain contained is unclear. Interestingly, only HIV-1M Vpu, a viral protein, can robustly counteract human tetherin, which tethers budding virions. Therefore, we hypothesize that this property of HIV-1M Vpu facilitates human-to-human viral transmission. Adopting a multilayered experimental-mathematical approach, we demonstrate that HIV-1M Vpu confers a 2.38-fold increase in the prevalence of HIV-1 transmission. When Vpu activity is lost, protected human populations emerge (i.e., intrinsic herd immunity develops) through the anti-viral effect of tetherin. We also reveal that all Vpus of transmitted\/founder HIV-1M viruses maintain anti-tetherin activity. These findings indicate that tetherin plays the role of a host restriction factor, providing 'intrinsic herd immunity', whereas Vpu has evolved in HIV-1M as a tetherin antagonist.","562":"Background: Mathematical models are powerful tools to study COVID-19. However, one fundamental challenge in current modeling approaches is the lack of accurate and comprehensive data. Complex epidemiological systems such as COVID-19 are especially challenging to the commonly used mechanistic model when our understanding of this pandemic rapidly refreshes. Objective: We aim to develop a data-driven workflow to extract, process, and develop deep learning (DL) methods to model the COVID-19 epidemic. We provide an alternative modeling approach to complement the current mechanistic modeling paradigm. Method: We extensively searched, extracted, and annotated relevant datasets from over 60 official press releases in Hubei, China, in 2020. Multivariate long short-term memory (LSTM) models were developed with different architectures to track and predict multivariate COVID-19 time series for 1, 2, and 3 days ahead. As a comparison, univariate LSTMs were also developed to track new cases, total cases, and new deaths. Results: A comprehensive dataset with 10 variables was retrieved and processed for 125 days in Hubei. Multivariate LSTM had reasonably good predictability on new deaths, hospitalization of both severe and critical patients, total discharges, and total monitored in hospital. Multivariate LSTM showed better results for new and total cases, and new deaths for 1-day-ahead prediction than univariate counterparts, but not for 2-day and 3-day-ahead predictions. Besides, more complex LSTM architecture seemed not to increase overall predictability in this study. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of DL models to complement current mechanistic approaches when the exact epidemiological mechanisms are still under investigation.","563":"A Markov decision model compared two strategies for stage III endometrial cancer: Tumor Molecular Testing (TMT) versus No TMT. TMT included sequential POLE next generation sequencing, mismatch repair immunohistochemistry (IHC), and p53 IHC. POLE-mutated patients were assigned to adjuvant radiation therapy; all others including controls were assigned to adjuvant chemoradiation. First recurrences were treated with 6 cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel. Second recurrences were treated with pembrolizumab alone for mismatch repair deficient patients and both pembrolizumab and lenvatinib for other patients. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test model robustness.Standard of care for adjuvant treatment of stage III endometrial cancer includes chemotherapy and radiation. In addition to stage, tumor molecular profiles may predict treatment outcomes, and prospective clinical trials are ongoing. However, tumor molecular testing is costly and time-consuming. Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of tumor molecular testing in stage III endometrial cancer.Compared to No TMT, TMT was cost saving with equivalent effectiveness. On one-way sensitivity analysis, TMT remained cost saving over all parameter ranges. TMT was also favored on probabilistic sensitivity analysis in 80% of iterations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000\/quality adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. However, when TMT was compared to mismatch repair IHC alone, TMT cost $182,798\/QALY gained.In this model of patients with stage III endometrial cancer, TMT was cost saving compared to No TMT. However, when compared to mismatch repair IHC alone, TMT was economically unfavorable.","564":"Factors affecting our ability to control an Ebola outbreak include transmissibility of the virus and the proportion of transmissions occurring asymptomatically. We performed a meta-analysis of Ebola household secondary attack rate (SAR), disaggregating by type of exposure (direct contact, no direct contact, nursing care, direct contact but no nursing care). The estimated overall household SAR is 12.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.6%-16.3%). Transmission was driven by direct contact, with little transmission occurring in its absence (SAR, 0.8% [95% CI, 0%-2.3%]). The greatest risk factor was the provision of nursing care (SAR, 47.9% [95% CI, 23.3%-72.6%]). There was evidence of a decline in household SAR for direct contact between 1976 and 2014 (P = .018). We estimate that 27.1% (95% CI, 14.5%-39.6%) of Ebola infections are asymptomatic. Our findings suggest that surveillance and containment measures should be effective for controlling Ebola.","565":"Rotarix\u00ae vaccine was introduced into the Malawi national immunization program in October 2012. We analyzed data on children 90% with two doses by July 2014, and declined to a low of ~80% in October 2020 before returning to pre-pandemic levels by July 2021. Our models captured the post-vaccination trends in RVGE incidence. Comparing observed RVGE cases to the model-predicted incidence without vaccination, overall effectiveness was estimated to be modest at 36.0% (95% prediction interval: 33.6%, 39.9%), peaking in 2014, and was highest in infants (52.5%; 95% prediction interval: 50.1%, 54.9%). Our mathematical models provide a validated platform for assessing strategies to improve rotavirus vaccine impact in low-income settings.","566":" adaptation, with few cases of serotype switching. Future surveillance is essential for documenting the long-term dynamics and resistance of NVT PNSP.","567":"Low rates of vaccination, emergence of novel variants of SARS-CoV-2, and increasing transmission relating to seasonal changes and relaxation of mitigation measures leave many US communities at risk for surges of COVID-19 that might strain hospital capacity, as in previous waves. The trajectories of COVID-19 hospitalizations differ across communities depending on their age distributions, vaccination coverage, cumulative incidence, and adoption of risk mitigating behaviors. Yet, existing predictive models of COVID-19 hospitalizations are almost exclusively focused on national- and state-level predictions. This leaves local policymakers in urgent need of tools that can provide early warnings about the possibility that COVID-19 hospitalizations may rise to levels that exceed local capacity. In this work, we develop a framework to generate simple classification rules to predict whether COVID-19 hospitalization will exceed the local hospitalization capacity within a 4- or 8-week period if no additional mitigating strategies are implemented during this time. This framework uses a simulation model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 hospitalizations in the US to train classification decision trees that are robust to changes in the data-generating process and future uncertainties. These generated classification rules use real-time data related to hospital occupancy and new hospitalizations associated with COVID-19, and when available, genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. We show that these classification rules present reasonable accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (all\u2009\u2265\u200980%) in predicting local surges in hospitalizations under numerous simulated scenarios, which capture substantial uncertainties over the future trajectories of COVID-19. Our proposed classification rules are simple, visual, and straightforward to use in practice by local decision makers without the need to perform numerical computations.","568":"Discrepancies were found between seroprevalence and confirmed case counts. High seroprevalence rates found among Black African donors can be ascribed to historical inequities. Our IFR estimates were useful in refining previous large disagreements about the severity of the epidemic in South Africa. Blood donor-based serosurveys provided a valuable and efficient way to provide near real-time monitoring of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.Blood donors who donated after each of three epidemic waves (Beta, Delta and first Omicron waves) were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibodies using the Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 total immunoglobulin assay. Roche Elecsys anti-spike antibody testing was done for the post-Omicron sampling. Prevalence of antibodies was estimated by age, sex, race and province and compared to official case reporting. Province and age group-specific IFRs were estimated using external excess mortality estimates.Confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses underestimate the total number of infections. Blood donors can provide representative seroprevalence estimates, which can be leveraged into reasonable estimates of total infection counts and infection fatality rate (IFR).The nationally weighted anti-nucleocapsid seroprevalence estimates after the Beta, Delta and Omicron waves were 47% (46.2%-48.6%), 71% (68.8%-73.5%) and 87% (85.5%-88.4%), respectively. There was no variation by age and sex, but there were statistically and epidemiologically significant differences by province (except at the latest time point) and race. There was a 13-fold higher seroprevalence than confirmed case counts at the first time point. Age-dependent IFR roughly doubled for every 10\u2009years of age increase over 6 decades from 0.014% in children to 6.793% in octogenarians.","569":"Accurate and reliable predictions of infectious disease dynamics can be valuable to public health organizations that plan interventions to decrease or prevent disease transmission. A great variety of models have been developed for this task, using different model structures, covariates, and targets for prediction. Experience has shown that the performance of these models varies; some tend to do better or worse in different seasons or at different points within a season. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to obtain a single prediction that leverages the strengths of each model. We considered a range of ensemble methods that each form a predictive density for a target of interest as a weighted sum of the predictive densities from component models. In the simplest case, equal weight is assigned to each component model; in the most complex case, the weights vary with the region, prediction target, week of the season when the predictions are made, a measure of component model uncertainty, and recent observations of disease incidence. We applied these methods to predict measures of influenza season timing and severity in the United States, both at the national and regional levels, using three component models. We trained the models on retrospective predictions from 14 seasons (1997\/1998-2010\/2011) and evaluated each model's prospective, out-of-sample performance in the five subsequent influenza seasons. In this test phase, the ensemble methods showed average performance that was similar to the best of the component models, but offered more consistent performance across seasons than the component models. Ensemble methods offer the potential to deliver more reliable predictions to public health decision makers.","570":"After the Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in the Americas in 2016, both Zika and dengue incidence declined to record lows in many countries in 2017-2018, but in 2019 dengue resurged in Brazil, causing ~2.1 million cases. In this study we use epidemiological, climatological and genomic data to investigate dengue dynamics in recent years in Brazil. First, we estimate dengue virus force of infection (FOI) and model mosquito-borne transmission suitability since the early 2000s. Our estimates reveal that DENV transmission was low in 2017-2018, despite conditions being suitable for viral spread. Our study also shows a marked decline in dengue susceptibility between 2002 and 2019, which could explain the synchronous decline of dengue in the country, partially as a result of protective immunity from prior ZIKV and\/or DENV infections. Furthermore, we performed phylogeographic analyses using 69 newly sequenced genomes of dengue virus serotype 1 and 2 from Brazil, and found that the outbreaks in 2018-2019 were caused by local DENV lineages that persisted for 5-10 years, circulating cryptically before and after the Zika epidemic. We hypothesize that DENV lineages may circulate at low transmission levels for many years, until local conditions are suitable for higher transmission, when they cause major outbreaks.","571":"Drug use disorder (DUD) is a world-wide problem and strategies to reduce its incidence are central to decreasing its burden. This investigation seeks to provide a proof of concept for the ability of agent-based modeling to predict the impact of the introduction of an effective school-based intervention, the Good Behavior Game (GBG), on reducing DUD in Scania, Sweden primarily through increasing school achievement.The model accurately reflected the growth of DUD in Scania over a multi-year time period and reproduced the levels of affected individuals in various socioeconomic strata over time. The GBG was estimated to improve school achievement and lower DUD registrations over time in males residing in disadvantaged areas by 10%, reflecting a decrease of 540 cases of DUD. Effects were considerably smaller in females.We modified an existing agent-based simulation model of opioid use disorder to represent DUD use in Scania County, southern Sweden. The model represents every individual in the population and is calibrated with the linked individual data from multiple sources including demographics, education, medical care, and criminal history. Risks for developing DUD were estimated from the population in Scania. Scenarios estimated the impact of introducing the GBG in schools located in disadvantaged areas.This work provides support for the impact of improving school achievement on long-term risks of developing DUD. It also demonstrated the value of using simulation modeling calibrated with data from a real population to estimate the impact of an intervention applied at a population level.","572":"CD4 cell count is a key measure of HIV disease progression, and the basis of successive international guidelines for treatment initiation. CD4 cell dynamics are used in mathematical and econometric models for evaluating public health need and interventions. Here, we estimate rates of CD4 decline, stratified by relevant covariates, in a form that is clinically transparent and can be directly used in such models.We analyse the AIDS Therapy Evaluation in the Netherlands cohort, including individuals with date of seroconversion estimated to be within 1 year and with intensive clinical follow-up prior to treatment initiation. Owing to the fact that CD4 cell counts are intrinsically noisy, we separate the analysis into long-term trends of smoothed CD4 cell counts and an observation model relating actual CD4 measurements to the underlying smoothed counts. We use a monotonic spline smoothing model to describe the decline of smoothed CD4 cell counts through categories CD4 above 500, 350-500, 200-350 and 200 cells\/\u03bcl or less. We estimate the proportion of individuals starting in each category after seroconversion and the average time spent in each category. We examine individual-level cofactors which influence these parameters.Among untreated individuals, the time spent in each compartment was 3.32, 2.70, 5.50 and 5.06 years. Only 76% started in the CD4 cell count above 500 cells\/\u03bcl compartment after seroconversion. Set-point viral load (SPVL) was an important factor: individuals with at least 5 log10 copies\/ml took 5.37 years to reach CD4 cell count less than 200 cells\/\u03bcl compared with 15.76 years for SPVL less than 4 log10 copies\/ml.Many individuals already have CD4 cell count below 500 cells\/\u03bcl after seroconversion. SPVL strongly influences the rate of CD4 decline. Treatment guidelines should consider measuring SPVL, whereas mathematical models should incorporate SPVL stratification.","573":"Because within-host Mycobacterium tuberculosis diversity complicates diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis (TB), we measured diversity prevalence and associated factors among 3,098 pulmonary TB patients in Lima, Peru.

Monthly age- and sex-standardized GIB data were fitted and predicted, based on population prescriptions of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), anticoagulants, other antiplatelet drugs, PPIs, and H. pylori therapies, using autoregressive integrated moving average model for time series analysis.The incidence of upper GIB (UGIB) showed a clear declining trend while lower GIB (LGIB) decreased slightly. Older population (>80 years) had the greatest decline in UGIB but was associated with an increase in LGIB. Prescriptions of PPIs and aspirin increased significantly with time. PPIs prescriptions were negatively associated with UGIB incidence (coefficient log(PPIs) -4.58; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -5.69, -3.47). H. pylori eradication in the previous month showed a nonsignificant trend on UGIB (coefficient -0.14; 95% CI: -0.30, 0.02). In contrast, aspirin increased the incidences of UGIB (coefficient 0.06; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.07) and LGIB (coefficient 0.04; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.05). NSAIDs, anticoagulants, and other antiplatelet drugs were not significantly associated with the trend of either UGIB or LGIB. UGIB is predicted to decline continuously but LGIB is projected to rise, particularly with increasing use of aspirin.UGIB incidences were decreasing and had been surpassed by LGIB. Based on population prescriptions of aspirin and PPIs, divergent trends of upper and lower GIB are expected, especially in elderly.","577":"In this paper, we present work on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in UK higher education settings using multiple approaches to assess the extent of university outbreaks, how much those outbreaks may have led to spillover in the community, and the expected effects of control measures. Firstly, we found that the distribution of outbreaks in universities in late 2020 was consistent with the expected importation of infection from arriving students. Considering outbreaks at one university, larger halls of residence posed higher risks for transmission. The dynamics of transmission from university outbreaks to wider communities is complex, and while sometimes spillover does occur, occasionally even large outbreaks do not give any detectable signal of spillover to the local population. Secondly, we explored proposed control measures for reopening and keeping open universities. We found the proposal of staggering the return of students to university residence is of limited value in terms of reducing transmission. We show that student adherence to testing and self-isolation is likely to be much more important for reducing transmission during term time. Finally, we explored strategies for testing students in the context of a more transmissible variant and found that frequent testing would be necessary to prevent a major outbreak.","578":"Continued monitoring of the seriousness of influenza viruses is a public health priority. We applied time-series regression models to data on cardio-respiratory mortality rates in Hong Kong from 2001 to 2011. We used surveillance data on outpatient consultations for influenza-like illness, and laboratory detections of influenza types\/subtypes to construct proxy measures of influenza activity. In the model we allowed the regression coefficients for influenza to drift over time, and adjusted for temperature and humidity. The regression coefficient for influenza A(H3N2) increased significantly in 2005. The regression coefficients for influenza A(H1N1) and B were relatively stable over the period. Our model suggested an increase in seriousness of A(H3N2) in 2005, the year after the appearance of the A\/Fujian\/411\/2002(H3N2)-like virus when the drifted A\/California\/7\/2004(H3N2)-like virus appeared. Ongoing monitoring of mortality and influenza activity could permit identification of future changes in seriousness of influenza virus infections.","579":"We conducted a prospective, genomic analysis of all culture-positive TB cases diagnosed in 2018 and 2019 in the Republic of Moldova. We used phylogenetic methods to identify putative transmission clusters; spatial and demographic data were analyzed to further describe local transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Of 2,236 participants, 779 (36%) had MDR-TB, of whom 386 (50%) had never been treated previously for TB. Moreover, 92% of multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis strains belonged to putative transmission clusters. Phylogenetic reconstruction identified 3 large clades that were comprised nearly uniformly of MDR-TB: 2 of these clades were of Beijing lineage, and 1 of Ural lineage, and each had additional distinct clade-specific second-line drug resistance mutations and geographic distributions. Spatial and temporal proximity between pairs of cases within a cluster was associated with greater genomic similarity. Our study lasted for only 2 years, a relatively short duration compared with the natural history of TB, and, thus, the ability to infer the full extent of transmission is limited.The MDR-TB epidemic in Moldova is associated with the local transmission of multiple M. tuberculosis strains, including distinct clades of highly drug-resistant M. tuberculosis with varying geographic distributions and drug resistance profiles. This study demonstrates the role of comprehensive genomic surveillance for understanding the transmission of M. tuberculosis and highlights the urgency of interventions to interrupt transmission of highly drug-resistant M. tuberculosis.The incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) remains critically high in countries of the former Soviet Union, where >20% of new cases and >50% of previously treated cases have resistance to rifampin and isoniazid. Transmission of resistant strains, as opposed to resistance selected through inadequate treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis (TB), is the main driver of incident MDR-TB in these countries.","580":"Spread of contagious pathogens critically depends on the number and types of contacts between infectious and susceptible hosts. Changes in social behavior by susceptible, exposed, or sick individuals thus have far-reaching downstream consequences for infectious disease spread. Although \"social distancing\" is now an all too familiar strategy for managing COVID-19, nonhuman animals also exhibit pathogen-induced changes in social interactions. Here, we synthesize the effects of infectious pathogens on social interactions in animals (including humans), review what is known about underlying mechanisms, and consider implications for evolution and epidemiology.","581":" test for significance testing between groups.The majority of people consider healthcare the most important determinant of health, well above other social determinants. This highlights the need for more investment in communication efforts around the importance of SDoH.Despite growing scholarship on the social determinants of health (SDoH), wider action remains in its early stages. Broad public understanding of SDoH can help catalyse such action. This paper aimed to document public perception of what matters for health from countries with broad geographic, cultural, linguistic, population composition, language and income level variation.Of 8753 respondents, 56.2% (95% CI 55.1% to 57.2%) ranked healthcare as the most important determinant of good health using the composite metric. This ranking was consistent across countries except in China where it appeared second. While genetics was cited as the most important determinant by 22.3% (95% CI 21.5% to 23.2%) of the overall sample with comparable rates in most countries, the percentage increased to 33.3% (95% CI 30.5% to 36.3%) in Germany and 35.9% (95% CI 33.0% to 38.8%) in the USA.

Being able to automatically extract relevant features needed for a given task from high-dimensional, heterogeneous data, deep learning (DL) holds great promise in this endeavour. This review paper addresses the main developments of DL algorithms and a set of general topics where DL is decisive, namely, within the SM landscape. It discusses how DL can be applied to SM with an emphasis on the applications to predictive, preventive and precision medicine. Several key challenges have been highlighted including delivering clinical impact and improving interpretability. We used some prototypical examples to highlight the relevance and significance of the adoption of DL in SM, one of them is involving the creation of a model for personalized Parkinson's disease. The review offers valuable insights and informs the research in DL and SM.","583":"Dogs represent the primary reservoir for Leishmania infantum human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) through phlebotomine sand flies. Public health initiatives targeting zoonotic VL commonly focus on dogs with severe clinical disease, often in renal failure, as they have previously been considered the most infectious to sand flies. However, more recent studies suggest that dogs with mild to moderate clinical disease may be more infectious than dogs with severe disease. The mechanisms of infectiousness from the skin and how this relates to transmissibility as clinical disease progresses is largely unknown. We evaluated dermal parasitism in dogs naturally infected with L. infantum across the four LeishVet clinical stages of disease. We establish the relationship between dermal parasitism, critical, frequently observed, clinical parameters such as anemia and creatinine, and infectiousness. Using RNAscope and confocal microscopy, we found notable variation in dermal parasitism between dogs, particularly within LeishVet II. Dogs with mild disease had significantly less dermal inflammation and parasitism than dogs with moderate or severe disease. We found significant correlations between anemia, dermal parasitism, and infectiousness (p = 0.0098, r = -0.4798; p = 0.0022, r = -0.8364). In contrast, we did not observe significant correlation between creatinine, a measure of renal function, and dermal parasitism or infectiousness. Host blood cell abnormalities, including anemia, correlate with infectiousness to sand flies. As these signs of disease often appear earlier in the course of disease, this indicates that classical measures of disease severity do not necessarily correlate with infectiousness or epidemiological importance. Public health initiatives attempting to break the zoonotic cycle of L. infantum infection should therefore focus on preventing transmission from infectious, anemic dogs, and not those with the most severe disease.","584":"Norovirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis and foodborne disease in the United States. The Food and Drug Administration recommends that food workers infected with norovirus be excluded from the workplace while symptomatic and for 48 hours after their symptoms subside. Compliance with this recommendation is not ideal, and the population-level impacts of changes in food-worker compliance have yet to be quantified. We aimed to assess the population impacts of varying degrees of compliance with the current recommendation through the use of a compartmental model. We modeled the number and proportion of symptomatic norovirus cases averted annually in the US population (using data from 1983-2014) in specific age groups (children aged <5 years, children aged 5-17 years, adults aged 18-64 years, and adults aged \u226565 years) under various scenarios of food-worker exclusion (i.e., proportion compliant and days of postsymptomatic exclusion) in comparison with a referent scenario which assumed that 66.6\u00af% of norovirus-symptomatic food workers and 0% of postsymptomatic food workers were excluded from work. Overall, we estimated that 6.0 million cases of norovirus have already been avoided annually under the referent scenario and that 6.7 million (28%) more cases might be avoided through 100% compliance with the current recommendations. Substantial population-level benefits were predicted from improved compliance in exclusion of norovirus-infected food workers from the workplace-benefits that may be realized through policies or programs incentivizing self-exclusion.","585":"In 2015, we detected clinical cases of babesiosis caused by Babesia microti in Yucat\u00e1n State, Mexico.

Although infection induces a strong MV-specific immune response that clears viral load and confers lifelong immunity, transient immunosuppression can also occur, leaving the host vulnerable to colonization from secondary pathogens. This apparent contradiction of viral clearance in the face of immunosuppression underlies what is often referred to as the 'measles paradox', and remains poorly understood. To explore the mechanistic basis underlying the measles paradox, and identify key factors driving viral clearance, we return to a previously published dataset of MV infection in rhesus macaques. These data include virological and immunological information that enable us to fit a mathematical model describing how the virus interacts with the host immune system. In particular, our model incorporates target cell depletion through infection of host immune cells-a hallmark of MV pathology that has been neglected from previous models. We find the model captures the data well, and that both target cell depletion and immune activation are required to explain the overall dynamics. Furthermore, by simulating conditions of increased target cell availability and suppressed cellular immunity, we show that the latter causes greater increases in viral load and delays to MV clearance. Overall, this signals a more dominant role for cellular immunity in resolving acute MV infection. Interestingly, we find contrasting dynamics dominated by target cell depletion when viral fitness is increased. This may have wider implications for animal morbilliviruses, such as canine distemper virus (CDV), that cause fatal target cell depletion in their natural hosts. To our knowledge this work represents the first fully calibrated within-host model of MV dynamics and, more broadly, provides a new platform from which to explore the complex mechanisms underlying Morbillivirus infection.","587":"Tumors exhibit high molecular, phenotypic, and physiological heterogeneity. In this effort, we employ quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to capture this heterogeneity through imaging-based subregions or \"habitats\" in a murine model of glioma. We then demonstrate the ability to model and predict the growth of the habitats using coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in the presence and absence of radiotherapy. Female Wistar rats (N\u2009=\u200921) were inoculated intracranially with 106 C6 glioma cells, a subset of which received 20\u00a0Gy (N\u2009=\u20095) or 40\u00a0Gy (N\u2009=\u20098) of radiation. All rats underwent diffusion-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI at up to seven time points. All MRI data at each visit were subsequently clustered using k-means to identify physiological tumor habitats. A family of four models consisting of three coupled ODEs were developed and calibrated to the habitat time series of control and treated rats and evaluated for predictive capability. The Akaike Information Criterion was used for model selection, and the normalized sum-of-square-error (SSE) was used to evaluate goodness-of-fit in model calibration and prediction. Three tumor habitats with significantly different imaging data characteristics (p\u2009<\u20090.05) were identified: high-vascularity high-cellularity, low-vascularity high-cellularity, and low-vascularity low-cellularity. Model selection resulted in a five-parameter model whose predictions of habitat dynamics yielded SSEs that were similar to the SSEs from the calibrated model. It is thus feasible to mathematically describe habitat dynamics in a preclinical model of glioma using biology-based ODEs, showing promise for forecasting heterogeneous tumor behavior.","588":"By August, 2021, South Africa had been affected by three waves of SARS-CoV-2; the second associated with the beta variant and the third with the delta variant. Data on SARS-CoV-2 burden, transmission, and asymptomatic infections from Africa are scarce. We aimed to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 burden and transmission in one rural and one urban community in South Africa.In this study, 565 (85\u00b73%) SARS-CoV-2 infections were asymptomatic and index case symptom status did not affect HCIR, suggesting a limited role for control measures targeting symptomatic individuals. Increased household transmission of beta and delta variants was likely to have contributed to successive waves of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with more than 60% of individuals infected by the end of follow-up.We conducted a prospective cohort study of households in Agincourt, Mpumalanga province (rural site) and Klerksdorp, North West province (urban site) from July, 2020 to August, 2021. We randomly selected households for the rural site from a health and sociodemographic surveillance system and for the urban site using GPS coordinates. Households with more than two members and where at least 75% of members consented to participate were eligible. Midturbinate nasal swabs were collected twice a week from household members irrespective of symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time RT-PCR (RT-rtPCR). Serum was collected every 2 months and tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Main outcomes were the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, frequency of reinfection, symptomatic fraction (percent of infected individuals with \u22651 symptom), the duration of viral RNA shedding (number of days of SARS-CoV-2 RT-rtPCR positivity), and the household cumulative infection risk (HCIR; number of infected household contacts divided by the number of susceptible household members).222 households (114 at the rural site and 108 at the urban site), and 1200 household members (643 at the rural site and 557 at the urban site) were included in the analysis. For 115\u2009759 nasal specimens from 1200 household members (follow-up 92\u00b75%), 1976 (1\u00b77%) were SARS-CoV-2-positive on RT-rtPCR. By RT-rtPCR and serology combined, 749 of 1200 individuals (62\u00b74% [95% CI 58\u00b71-66\u00b74]) had at least one SARS-CoV-2 infection episode, and 87 of 749 (11\u00b76% [9\u00b74-14\u00b72]) were reinfected. The mean infection episode duration was 11\u00b76 days (SD 9\u00b70; range 4-137). Of 662 RT-rtPCR-confirmed episodes (>14 days after the start of follow-up) with available data, 97 (14\u00b77% [11\u00b79-17\u00b79]) were symptomatic with at least one symptom (in individuals aged 30) of the index case (OR 5\u00b73 [2\u00b73-12\u00b74]) and beta and delta variant infection (vs Wuhan-Hu-1, OR 3\u00b73 [1\u00b74-8\u00b72] and 10\u00b74 [4\u00b71-26\u00b77], respectively) were associated with increased HCIR. People living with HIV who were not virally supressed (\u2265400 viral load copies per mL) were more likely to develop symptomatic illness when infected with SAR-CoV-2 (OR 3\u00b73 [1\u00b73-8\u00b74]), and shed SARS-CoV-2 for longer (hazard ratio 0\u00b74 [95% CI 0\u00b73-0\u00b76]) compared with HIV-uninfected individuals.US CDC, South Africa National Institute for Communicable Diseases, and Wellcome Trust.","589":"Networks can evolve even on a short-term basis. This phenomenon is well understood by network scientists, but receive little attention in empirical literature involving real-world networks. On one hand, this is due to the deceitfully fixed topology of some networks such as many physical infrastructures, whose evolution is often deemed unlikely to occur in short term; on the other hand, the lack of data prohibits scientists from studying subjects such as social networks that seem likely to evolve on a short-term basis. We show that both networks-the infrastructure network and social network-are able to demonstrate evolutionary dynamics at the system level even in the short-term, characterized by shifting between different phases as predicted in network science. We develop a methodology of tracking the evolutionary dynamics of the two networks by incorporating flows and the microstructure of networks such as motifs. This approach is applied to the human interaction network and two transportation networks (subway and taxi) in the context of Hurricane Sandy, using publically available Twitter data and transportation data. Our result shows that significant changes in the system-level structure of networks can be detected on a continuous basis. This result provides a promising channel for real-time tracking in the future.","590":" 28%) and no major relaxations in distancing, masking, gathering size, or hygiene guidelines between now and spring 2021, our model predicts that a combination of vaccination and population immunity will lead to low or near-zero transmission levels by the second quarter of 2021.","591":"Poor T cell epitope cross-conservation between emergent G4 and swine and human influenza vaccines in the US may enable G4 to spread in swine and spillover to human populations in the absence of protective antibody response. One European influenza vaccine, HL03, may protect against emergent G4. This study illustrates the use of the EpiCC tool for prospective assessment of existing vaccine strains against emergent viruses in swine and human populations.The overall T cell epitope content of US commercial swine vaccines was poorly conserved with G4, with an average T cell epitope coverage of 35.7%. EpiCC scores for the comparison between current human influenza vaccines and circulating human influenza strains were also very low. In contrast, the T cell epitope coverage of a recent European swine influenza vaccine (HL03) was 65.8% against G4.Pandemic influenza viruses may emerge from animal reservoirs and spread among humans in the absence of cross-reactive antibodies in the human population. Immune response to highly conserved T cell epitopes in vaccines may still reduce morbidity and limit the spread of the new virus even when cross-protective antibody responses are lacking.We used an established epitope content prediction and comparison tool, Epitope Content Comparison (EpiCC), to assess the potential for emergent H1N1 G4 swine influenza A virus (G4) to impact swine and human populations. We identified and computed the total cross-conserved T cell epitope content in HA sequences of human seasonal and experimental influenza vaccines, swine influenza vaccines from Europe and the United States (US) against G4.","592":"The persistence mechanisms of Rift Valley fever (RVF), a zoonotic arboviral haemorrhagic fever, at both local and broader geographical scales have yet to be fully understood and rigorously quantified. We developed a mathematical metapopulation model describing RVF virus transmission in livestock across the four islands of the Comoros archipelago, accounting for island-specific environments and inter-island animal movements. By fitting our model in a Bayesian framework to 2004-2015 surveillance data, we estimated the importance of environmental drivers and animal movements on disease persistence, and tested the impact of different control scenarios on reducing disease burden throughout the archipelago. Here we report that (i) the archipelago network was able to sustain viral transmission in the absence of explicit disease introduction events after early 2007, (ii) repeated outbreaks during 2004-2020 may have gone under-detected by local surveillance, and (iii) co-ordinated within-island control measures are more effective than between-island animal movement restrictions.","593":"We extend a technique of approximation of the long-term behavior of a supercritical stochastic epidemic model, using the WKB approximation and a Hamiltonian phase space, to the subcritical case. The limiting behavior of the model and approximation are qualitatively different in the subcritical case, requiring a novel analysis of the limiting behavior of the Hamiltonian system away from its deterministic subsystem. This yields a novel, general technique of approximation of the quasistationary distribution of stochastic epidemic and birth-death models and may lead to techniques for analysis of these models beyond the quasistationary distribution. For a classic SIS model, the approximation found for the quasistationary distribution is very similar to published approximations but not identical. For a birth-death process without depletion of susceptibles, the approximation is exact. Dynamics on the phase plane similar to those predicted by the Hamiltonian analysis are demonstrated in cross-sectional data from trachoma treatment trials in Ethiopia, in which declining prevalences are consistent with subcritical epidemic dynamics.","594":"Genetic engineering now enables the design of live viral vaccines that are potentially transmissible. Some designs merely modify a single viral genome to improve on the age-old method of attenuation whereas other designs create chimeras of viral genomes. Transmission has the benefit of increasing herd immunity above that achieved by direct vaccination alone but also increases the opportunity for vaccine evolution, which typically undermines vaccine utility. Different designs have different epidemiological consequences but also experience different evolution. Approaches that integrate vaccine engineering with an understanding of evolution and epidemiology will reap the greatest benefit from vaccine transmission.","595":"With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, one of the major concerns is the direct medical cost and resource use burden imposed on the US health care system. We developed a Monte Carlo simulation model that represented the US population and what could happen to each person who got infected. We estimated resource use and direct medical costs per symptomatic infection and at the national level, with various \"attack rates\" (infection rates), to understand the potential economic benefits of reducing the burden of the disease. A single symptomatic COVID-19 case could incur a median direct medical cost of $3,045 during the course of the infection alone. If 80\u00a0percent of the US population were to get infected, the result could be a median of 44.6\u00a0million hospitalizations, 10.7\u00a0million intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, 6.5\u00a0million patients requiring a ventilator, 249.5\u00a0million hospital bed days, and $654.0\u00a0billion in direct medical costs over the course of the pandemic. If 20\u00a0percent of the US population were to get infected, there could be a median of 11.2\u00a0million hospitalizations, 2.7\u00a0million ICU admissions, 1.6\u00a0million patients requiring a ventilator, 62.3\u00a0million hospital bed days, and $163.4\u00a0billion in direct medical costs over the course of the pandemic.","596":"Capturing group-specific sequences between two groups of genomic\/metagenomic sequences is critical for the follow-up identifications of singular nucleotide variants (SNVs), gene families, microbial species or other elements associated with each group. A sequence that is present, or rich, in one group, but absent, or scarce, in another group is considered a \"group-specific\" sequence in our study. We developed a user-friendly tool, KmerGO, to identify group-specific sequences between two groups of genomic\/metagenomic long sequences or high-throughput sequencing datasets. Compared with other tools, KmerGO captures group-specific k-mers (k up to 40 bps) with much lower requirements for computing resources in much shorter running time. For a 1.05 TB dataset (.fasta), it takes KmerGO about 21.5 h (including k-mer counting) to return assembled group-specific sequences on a regular stand-alone workstation with no more than 1 GB memory. Furthermore, KmerGO can also be applied to capture trait-associated sequences for continuous-trait. Through multi-process parallel computing, KmerGO is implemented with both graphic user interface and command line on Linux and Windows free from any pre-installed supporting environments, packages, and complex configurations. The output group-specific k-mers or sequences from KmerGO could be the inputs of other tools for the downstream discovery of biomarkers, such as genetic variants, species, or genes.

We used a stochastic, spatially resolved, transmission model (the Global Epidemic and Mobility model) to simulate epidemics and site-level incidence at 100 high-risk sites in the Americas. We considered several strategies for prioritizing sites (average site-level incidence of infection across epidemics, median incidence, probability of exceeding 1% incidence), selecting the number of sites, and allocating sample size across sites (equal enrollment, proportional to average incidence, proportional to rank). To evaluate each design, we stochastically simulated trials in each hypothetical epidemic by drawing observed cases from site-level incidence data.Mathematical and statistical models may assist in designing successful vaccination trials by capturing uncertainty and correlation in future transmission. Although many factors affect site selection, such as logistical feasibility, models can help investigators optimize site selection and the number and size of participating sites. Although our study focused on trial design for an emerging arbovirus, a similar approach can be made for any infectious disease with the appropriate model for the particular disease.Novel strategies are needed to make vaccine efficacy trials more robust given uncertain epidemiology of infectious disease outbreaks, such as arboviruses like Zika. Spatially resolved mathematical and statistical models can help investigators identify sites at highest risk of future transmission and prioritize these for inclusion in trials. Models can also characterize uncertainty in whether transmission will occur at a site, and how nearby or connected sites may have correlated outcomes. A structure is needed for how trials can use models to address key design questions, including how to prioritize sites, the optimal number of sites, and how to allocate participants across sites.When constraining overall trial size, the optimal number of sites represents a balance between prioritizing highest-risk sites and having enough sites to reduce the chance of observing too few endpoints. The optimal number of sites remained roughly constant regardless of the targeted number of events, although it is necessary to increase the sample size to achieve the desired power. Though different ranking strategies returned different site orders, they performed similarly with respect to trial power. Instead of enrolling participants equally from each site, investigators can allocate participants proportional to projected incidence, though this did not provide an advantage in our example because the top sites had similar risk profiles. Sites from the same geographic region may have similar outcomes, so optimal combinations of sites may be geographically dispersed, even when these are not the highest ranked sites.","598":"Symptom propagation occurs when the symptom set an individual experiences is correlated with the symptom set of the individual who infected them. Symptom propagation may dramatically affect epidemiological outcomes, potentially causing clusters of severe disease. Conversely, it could result in chains of mild infection, generating widespread immunity with minimal cost to public health. Despite accumulating evidence that symptom propagation occurs for many respiratory pathogens, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we conducted a scoping literature review for 14 respiratory pathogens to ascertain the extent of evidence for symptom propagation by two mechanisms: dose-severity relationships and route-severity relationships. We identify considerable heterogeneity between pathogens in the relative importance of the two mechanisms, highlighting the importance of pathogen-specific investigations. For almost all pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, we found support for at least one of the two mechanisms. For some pathogens, including influenza, we found convincing evidence that both mechanisms contribute to symptom propagation. Furthermore, infectious disease models traditionally do not include symptom propagation. We summarize the present state of modelling advancements to address the methodological gap. We then investigate a simplified disease outbreak scenario, finding that under strong symptom propagation, isolating mildly infected individuals can have negative epidemiological implications.","599":"Proposed is a multicomponent model for the estimation of light-emitting diode (LED) lumen maintenance using test data that were acquired in accordance with the test standards of the Illumination Engineering Society of North America, i.e., LM-80-08. Lumen maintenance data acquired with this test do not always follow exponential decay, particularly data collected in the first 1000 h or under low-stress (e.g., low temperature) conditions. This deviation from true exponential behavior makes it difficult to use the full data set in models for the estimation of lumen maintenance decay coefficient. As a result, critical information that is relevant to the early life or low-stress operation of LED light sources may be missed. We present an efficiency-decay model approach, where all lumen maintenance data can be used to provide an alternative estimate of the decay rate constant. The approach considers a combined model wherein one part describes an initial \u0093break-in\u0094 period and another part describes the decay in lumen maintenance. During the break-in period, several mechanisms within the LED can act to produce a small (typically <; 10%) increase in luminous flux. The effect of the break-in period and its longevity is more likely to be present at low-ambient temperatures and currents, where the discrepancy between a standard TM-21 approach and our proposed model is the largest. For high temperatures and currents, the difference between the estimates becomes nonsubstantial. Our approach makes use of all the collected data and avoids producing unrealistic estimates of the decay coefficient.","600":"Antimalarial chemoprophylaxis with artemether-lumefantrine was acceptable and well tolerated and substantially reduced the risk of malaria. Malaria chemoprophylaxis among high-risk groups such as forest workers could be a valuable tool for accelerating elimination in the Greater Mekong subregion.Malaria in the eastern Greater Mekong subregion has declined to historic lows. Countries in the Greater Mekong subregion are accelerating malaria elimination in the context of increasing antimalarial drug resistance. Infections are now increasingly concentrated in remote, forested foci. No intervention has yet shown satisfactory efficacy against forest-acquired malaria. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of malaria chemoprophylaxis among forest goers in Cambodia.We conducted an open-label, individually randomised controlled trial in Cambodia, which recruited participants aged 16-65 years staying overnight in forests. Participants were randomly allocated 1:1 to antimalarial chemoprophylaxis, a 3-day course of twice-daily artemether-lumefantrine followed by the same daily dosing once a week while travelling in the forest and for a further 4 weeks after leaving the forest (four tablets per dose; 20 mg of artemether and 120 mg of lumefantrine per tablet), or a multivitamin with no antimalarial activity. Allocations were done according to a computer-generated randomisation schedule, and randomisation was in permuted blocks of size ten and stratified by village. Investigators and participants were not masked to drug allocation, but laboratory investigations were done without knowledge of allocation. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of either clinical malaria with any Plasmodium species within 1-28, 29-56, or 57-84 days, or subclinical infection detected by PCR on days 28, 56, or 84 using complete-case analysis of the intention-to-treat population. Adherence to study drug was assessed primarily by self-reporting during follow-up visits. Adverse events were assessed in the intention-to-treat population as a secondary endpoint from self-reporting at any time, plus a physical examination and symptom questionnaire at follow-up. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04041973) and is complete.Between March 11 and Nov 20, 2020, 1480 individuals were enrolled, of whom 738 were randomly assigned to artemether-lumefantrine and 742 to the multivitamin. 713 participants in the artemether-lumefantrine group and 714 in the multivitamin group had a PCR result or confirmed clinical malaria by rapid diagnostic test during follow-up. During follow-up, 19 (3%, 95% CI 2-4) of 713 participants had parasitaemia or clinical malaria in the artemether-lumefantrine group and 123 (17%, 15-20) of 714 in the multivitamin group (absolute risk difference 15%, 95% CI 12-18; p<0\u00b70001). During follow-up, there were 166 malaria episodes caused by Plasmodium vivax, 14 by Plasmodium falciparum, and five with other or mixed species infections. The numbers of participants with P vivax were 18 (3%, 95% CI 2-4) in the artemether-lumefantrine group versus 112 (16%, 13-19) in the multivitamin group (absolute risk difference 13%, 95% CI 10-16; p<0\u00b70001). The numbers of participants with P falciparum were two (0\u00b73%, 95% CI 0\u00b703-1\u00b701) in the artemether-lumefantrine group versus 12 (1\u00b77%, 0\u00b79-2\u00b79) in the multivitamin group (absolute risk difference 1\u00b74%, 95% CI 0\u00b74-2\u00b74; p=0\u00b7013). Overall reported adherence to the full course of medication was 97% (95% CI 96-98; 1797 completed courses out of 1854 courses started) in the artemether-lumefantrine group and 98% (97-98; 1842 completed courses in 1885 courses started) in the multivitamin group. Overall prevalence of adverse events was 1\u00b79% (355 events in 18\u2009806 doses) in the artemether-lumefantrine group and 1\u00b71% (207 events in 19\u2009132 doses) in the multivitamin group (p<0\u00b70001).The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; Wellcome Trust.","601":"Background\r\nShiga toxin producing Escherichia coli O157 can cause severe bloody diarrhea and haemolytic uraemic syndrome.

The aim of this study was to analyse the genome sequences of 16 (fourteen T4 and two T7) E. coli O157 typing phages and to determine the genes responsible for the subtle differences in phage type profiles.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nThe typing phages were sequenced using paired-end Illumina sequencing at The Genome Analysis Centre and the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency and bioinformatics programs including Velvet, Brig and Easyfig were used to analyse them. A two-way Euclidian cluster analysis highlighted the associations between groups of phage types and typing phages. The analysis showed that the T7 typing phages (9 and 10) differed by only three genes and that the T4 typing phages formed three distinct groups of similar genomic sequences: Group 1 (1, 8, 11, 12 and 15, 16), Group 2 (3, 6, 7 and 13) and Group 3 (2, 4, 5 and 14). The E. coli O157 phage typing scheme exhibited a significantly modular network linked to the genetic similarity of each group showing that these groups are specialised to infect a subset of phage types.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nSequencing the typing phage has enabled us to identify the variable genes within each group and to determine how this corresponds to changes in phage type.","602":"Manure-derived amendments are commonly applied to soil, raising questions about whether antibiotic use in livestock could influence the soil resistome (collective antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs)) and ultimately contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance to humans during food production. Here, we examined the metagenomes of soils amended with raw or composted manure generated from dairy cows administered pirlimycin and cephapirin (antibiotic) or no antibiotics (control) relative to unamended soils. Initial amendment (Day 1) with manure or compost significantly increased the diversity (richness) of ARGs in soils (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) and resulted in distinct abundances of individual ARG types. Notably, initial amendment with antibiotic-manure significantly increased the total ARG relative abundances (per 16S rRNA gene) in the soils (2.21\u202f\u00d7\u202funamended soils, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). After incubating 120\u202fdays, to simulate a wait period before crop harvest, 282 ARGs reduced 4.33-fold (median) up to 307-fold while 210 ARGs increased 2.89-fold (median) up to 76-fold in the antibiotic-manure-amended soils, resulting in reduced total ARG relative abundances equivalent to those of the unamended soils. We further assembled the metagenomic data and calculated resistome risk scores, which was recently defined as a relative index comparing co-occurrence of sequences corresponding to ARGs, mobile genetic elements, and putative pathogens on the same scaffold. Initial amendment of manure significantly increased the soil resistome risk scores, especially when generated by cows administered antibiotics, while composting reduced the effects and resulted in soil resistomes more similar to the background. The risk scores of manure-amended soils reduced to levels comparable to the unamended soils after 120\u202fdays. Overall, this study provides an integrated, high-resolution examination of the effects of prior antibiotic use, composting, and a 120-day wait period on soil resistomes following manure-derived amendment, demonstrating that all three management practices have measurable effects and should be taken into consideration in the development of policy and practice for mitigating the spread of antibiotic resistance.","603":"Studies in mice and older, subfertile women have found that air pollution exposure may compromise female reproduction. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of air pollution on ovarian reserve and outcomes of ovarian stimulation among young, healthy females. We included 472 oocyte donors who underwent 781 ovarian stimulation cycles at a fertility clinic in Atlanta, Georgia, USA (2008-2019). Antral follicle count (AFC) was assessed with transvaginal ultrasonography and total and mature oocyte count was assessed following oocyte retrieval. Ovarian sensitivity index (OSI) was calculated as the total number of oocytes divided by total gonadotrophin dose\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01000. Daily ambient exposure to nitric oxide (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter\u00a0\u2264\u00a02.5 (PM2.5) was estimated using a fused regional\u00a0+\u00a0line-source model for near-surface releases at a 250\u00a0m resolution based on residential address. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate the associations of an interquartile range (IQR) increase in pollutant exposure with outcomes adjusted for donor characteristics, census-level poverty, and meteorological factors. The median (IQR) age among oocyte donors was 25.0 (5.0) years, and 31% of the donors were racial\/ethnic minorities. The median (IQR) exposure to NOx, CO, and PM2.5 in the 3\u00a0months prior to stimulation was 37.7 (32.0) ppb, 612 (317) ppb, and 9.8 (2.9) \u00b5g\/m3, respectively. Ambient air pollution exposure in the 3\u00a0months before AFC was not associated with AFC. An IQR increase in PM2.5 in the 3\u00a0months before AFC and during stimulation was associated with -7.5% (95% CI -14.1, -0.4) and -6.4% (95% CI -11.0, -1.6) fewer mature oocytes, and a -1.9 (95% CI -3.2, -0.5) and -1.0 (95% CI -1.8, -0.2) lower OSI, respectively. Our results suggest that lowering the current 24-h PM2.5 standard in the US to 25\u00a0\u00b5g\/m3 may still not adequately protect against the reprotoxic effects of short-term PM2.5 exposure.","604":"Ultraviolet disinfection is a promising solution for decentralized drinking water systems such as communal water taps. A potential health risk is enzymatic photorepair of pathogens after UV disinfection, which can result in regrowth of pathogens. Even though photorepair is a known issue, no formal risk assessments have been conducted for photorepair after UV disinfection in drinking water. The main objective was to construct a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) of photorepair after UV disinfection of drinking water in a decentralized system. UV disinfection and photorepair kinetics for E. coli were modelled using reproducible fluence-based determinations. Impacts of water collection patterns, and wavelength-dependent water container material transmittance, sunlight intensity, and photorepair enzyme absorbance were quantified. After UV disinfection by 16 or 40 mJ\/cm2 of < 5-log microorganisms per L, risk of infection did not exceed 1-in-10,000 under conditions permitting E. coli photorepair. Risk from photorepair was less than 1-in-10,000 for photorepair light exposure  2.5\u00a0h between modelled times of 9 AM - 3 PM. The model can be expanded to other pathogens as UV fluence and photorepair fluence response kinetics become available, and this QMRA can be used to inform the placement of community water access points to reduce risk of photorepair and ensure adequate shelf life of UV disinfected water under safe storage conditions.","605":"Background: The impact of gene-sets on a spatial phenotype is not necessarily uniform across different locations of cancer tissue. This study introduces a computational platform, GWLCT, for combining gene set analysis with spatial data modeling to provide a new statistical test for location-specific association of phenotypes and molecular pathways in spatial single-cell RNA-seq data collected from an input tumor sample. Methods: The main advantage of GWLCT consists of an analysis beyond global significance, allowing the association between the gene-set and the phenotype to vary across the tumor space. At each location, the most significant linear combination is found using a geographically weighted shrunken covariance matrix and kernel function. Whether a fixed or adaptive bandwidth is determined based on a cross-validation cross procedure. Our proposed method is compared to the global version of linear combination test (LCT), bulk and random-forest based gene-set enrichment analyses using data created by the Visium Spatial Gene Expression technique on an invasive breast cancer tissue sample, as well as 144 different simulation scenarios. Results: In an illustrative example, the new geographically weighted linear combination test, GWLCT, identifies the cancer hallmark gene-sets that are significantly associated at each location with the five spatially continuous phenotypic contexts in the tumors defined by different well-known markers of cancer-associated fibroblasts. Scan statistics revealed clustering in the number of significant gene-sets. A spatial heatmap of combined significance over all selected gene-sets is also produced. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms other methods in the considered scenarios, especially when the spatial association increases. Conclusion: Our proposed approach considers the spatial covariance of gene expression to detect the most significant gene-sets affecting a continuous phenotype. It reveals spatially detailed information in tissue space and can thus play a key role in understanding the contextual heterogeneity of cancer cells.","606":"Curbing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires a thorough understanding of risk factors for transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent. Institutions of higher education present unique challenges for controlling disease spread because of features inherent to these settings. Our objective was to determine risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among a university student population in the northeastern USA during the spring and fall 2021 semesters, using the case-control study design. Cases were defined as students with a newly diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection, detected either through the robust PCR-based surveillance testing program on campus or through healthcare testing if symptoms compatible with COVID-19 were present. Controls were defined as students with negative SARS-CoV-2 status, based on consistently negative PCR results at the time of selection. A comprehensive questionnaire was administered to each student enrolled in the study, covering a broad range of campus life activities. A total of 446 cases and 1,185 controls were included in this study. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that recent party attendance (adjusted OR = 2.3, p < 0.0001), recently visiting a bar (aOR = 1.6, p = 0.007), living in a campus residence hall (aOR = 1.6, p = 0.001), fraternity\/sorority membership (aOR = 1.8, p = 0.002), and recent travel (aOR = 1.3, p = 0.04) were associated with being a COVID-19 case. Having an on-campus job was negatively associated with being a COVID-19 case (aOR = 0.6, p = 0.0003). Among cases, the most commonly reported symptoms were cough (43.9%), fatigue (38.1%), and sore throat (30.3%). These findings can be used to inform the development of COVID-19 mitigation strategies and public health outreach efforts in university settings, thus reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission among students and helping to preserve the vital education and research missions of these institutions.

We used two different methods, the rate-based method and the proportion-based method, to estimate national RSV-associated ALRI hospitalisations in children younger than 5 years in 2019. The rate-based method synthesised data for laboratory-confirmed RSV-associated ALRI hospitalisation rates using a spatiotemporal Gaussian process meta-regression (ST-GPR). The proportion-based method applied data for RSV positive proportions among ALRI to all-cause ALRI hospitalisation envelopes (ie, total disease burden of ALRI hospitalisations of any cause) using a Bayesian regularised trimmed meta-regression (MR-BRT). Where applicable, we reported estimates by both methods to provide a plausible range for each country.A total of 334 studies and 1985 data points (defined as an individual estimate for one age group and 1 year for each study) were included in our analysis, accounting for 398 million (59%) of the 677 million children aged younger than 5 years worldwide representing 58 countries. We reported the number of annual national RSV-associated ALRI hospitalisations for 29 countries using the rate-based method, and for 42 countries using the proportion-based method. The median number of RSV-associated ALRI hospitalisations in children younger than 5 years was 8\u00b725 thousand (IQR 1\u00b797-48\u00b701), and the median rate of RSV-associated ALRI hospitalisations was 514 (339-866) hospitalisations per thousand children younger than 5 years. Despite large variation among countries, a high proportion of the RSV-associated ALRI hospitalisations were in infants aged younger than 1 year in all countries (median proportion 45%, IQR 32-56). In 272 (76%) of the 358 years included in the analysis, the RSV-associated ALRI hospitalisation rate fluctuated between 0\u00b78 and 1\u00b72 times the country's median yearly rate. General agreement was observed between estimates by the rate-based method and proportion-based method, with the exceptions of India, Kenya, Norway, and Philippines.By incorporating data from various sources, our study provides robust estimates on national level burden of RSV-associated ALRI hospitalisation in children aged younger than 5 years. These estimates are important for informing policy for the introduction of RSV immunisations and also serve as baseline data for the RSV disease burden in young children.The Foundation for Influenza Epidemiology.Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the predominant viral pathogen associated with acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in children who are younger than 5 years. Little is reported on the national estimates of RSV-associated ALRI hospitalisations in these children on the basis of robust epidemiological data. We aimed to generate national level estimates for RSV-associated ALRI hospitalisations in children aged younger than 5 years.","608":"We measured plasma and\/or serum antibody responses to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 in 343 North American patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (of which 93% required hospitalization) up to 122 days after symptom onset and compared them to responses in 1548 individuals whose blood samples were obtained prior to the pandemic. After setting seropositivity thresholds for perfect specificity (100%), we estimated sensitivities of 95% for IgG, 90% for IgA, and 81% for IgM for detecting infected individuals between 15 and 28 days after symptom onset. While the median time to seroconversion was nearly 12 days across all three isotypes tested, IgA and IgM antibodies against RBD were short-lived with median times to seroreversion of 71 and 49 days after symptom onset. In contrast, anti-RBD IgG responses decayed slowly through 90 days with only 3 seropositive individuals seroreverting within this time period. IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 RBD were strongly correlated with anti-S neutralizing antibody titers, which demonstrated little to no decrease over 75 days since symptom onset. We observed no cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-targeted antibodies with other widely circulating coronaviruses (HKU1, 229 E, OC43, NL63). These data suggest that RBD-targeted antibodies are excellent markers of previous and recent infection, that differential isotype measurements can help distinguish between recent and older infections, and that IgG responses persist over the first few months after infection and are highly correlated with neutralizing antibodies.","609":"Wastewater reuse for agriculture is common worldwide; wastewater treatment, however, is rare in many countries, leading to high potential for exposure to harmful pathogens. Mexico City, one of the largest producers of untreated wastewater for agricultural use worldwide, was the site of key epidemiologic studies conducted in the 1990s. We both reviewed the literature on and conducted a cross-sectional study of diarrheal risk and wastewater contamination to provide an updated assessment of health risks and to inform an upcoming update of the 2006 WHO guidelines on wastewater reuse. We surveyed communities in the Mezquital Valley that use wastewater for irrigation and communities that use well water to compare the prevalence of self-reported diarrheal disease in children under five years old. Wastewater, well water, household environmental samples, and stool samples were collected and analyzed. Communities exposed to wastewater had a higher one-week prevalence of diarrhea (10%) compared to unexposed communities (5%). This association remained in an adjusted modified Poisson regression model (PR\u00a0=\u00a02.31, 95% CI 1.00, 5.31), but not when limited to households engaged in agriculture. Water quality indicators document differences between irrigation water from the two community groups. These results are in agreement with 25 population studies identified by our review that were conducted since or not included in the 2006 WHO guidelines and show consistent negative impacts of wastewater exposure on health. While overall diarrheal prevalence has declined when compared to studies conducted over 25 years ago in the same region, the association of diarrheal disease and wastewater exposure has remained and possibly increased. With rising urbanization worldwide, attention to these risks and wastewater treatment is becoming increasingly important.","610":"Background: The American Thyroid Association (ATA) published the 2015 Management Guidelines for Patients with Thyroid Nodules and Differentiated Thyroid Cancer recommending a shift to less aggressive diagnostic, surgical, and post-operative treatment strategies. At the same time and perhaps related to the new guidelines, there has been a shift to outpatient thyroid surgery. The aim of the current study was to assess physician adherence to these recommendations by identifying and quantifying temporal trends in the rates and indications for thyroid procedures in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Methods: Using the IBM\u00ae MarketScan\u00ae Commercial database, we identified employer-insured patients in the United States who underwent outpatient and inpatient thyroid surgery from 2007 to 2018. Thyroid surgery was classified as total thyroidectomy (TT), thyroid lobectomy (TL) or a completion thyroidectomy. The surgical indication diagnosis was also determined and classified as either benign or malignant thyroid disease. We compared outpatient and inpatient trends in surgery between benign and malignant thyroid disease before and after the release of the 2015 ATA guidelines. Results: A total of 220,088 patients who underwent thyroid surgery were included in the analysis. Approximately 80% of thyroid lobectomies (TL) were performed in the outpatient setting vs. 70% of total thyroidectomies (TT). Longitudinal analysis showed a statistically significant changepoint for TT proportion occurring in November 2015. The proportion of TT as compared to TL decreased from 80% in September 2015 to 39% by December 2018. For thyroid cancer, there is an increasing trend in performing TL over TT, increasing from 17% in 2015 to 28% by the end of 2018. Conclusions: There was a significant changepoint occurring in November 2015 in the operative and management trends for benign and malignant thyroid disease.","611":"Our findings suggest that delaying the first birth from adolescence to adulthood may improve birth outcomes and reduce mortality of neonates. Babies born to younger mothers, who are smaller at birth, may experience catch-up growth, reducing some of the anthropometric disparities by 6\u2009months of age.We used data from randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) of 21\u200a555 neonates in Burkina Faso conducted in 2019-2020. Newborns of mothers aged 13-19\u2009years (adolescents) and 20-40\u2009years (adults) were enrolled in the study 8-27\u2009days after birth and followed for 6\u00a0months. Measurements of child's anthropometric measures were collected at baseline and 6\u00a0months. We used multivariable linear regression to compare child anthropometric measures at birth and 6\u2009months, and logistic regression models to obtain the odds ratio (OR) of all-cause mortality. Using multidimensional deterministic analysis, we assessed scenarios in which the difference in selection probability of adolescent and adult mothers with infant mortality at 6\u2009months increased from 0% to 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% if babies born to adolescent mothers more often died during the first week or were of lower weight and hence were not eligible to be included in the original RCT. Using probabilistic bias analysis, we assessed the role of unmeasured confounding by socio-economic status (SES).Maternal age is increasingly recognized as a predictor of birth outcomes. Given the importance of birth and growth outcomes for children's development, wellbeing and survival, this study examined the effect of maternal age on infant birth and growth outcomes at 6\u2009months and mortality. Additionally, we conducted quantitative bias analysis (QBA) to estimate the role of selection bias and unmeasured confounding on the effect of maternal age on infant mortality.Babies born to adolescent mothers on average had lower weight at birth, lower anthropometric measures at baseline, similar growth outcomes from enrolment to 6\u00a0months and higher odds of all-cause mortality by 6\u00a0months (adjusted OR\u2009=\u20092.17, 95% CI 1.35 to 3.47) compared with those born to adult mothers. In QBA, we found that differential selection of adolescent and adult mothers could bias the observed effect (OR\u2009=\u20092.24, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.57) towards the null [bias-corrected OR range: 2.37 (95% CI 1.49 to 3.77) to 2.84 (95% CI 1.79 to 4.52)], whereas unmeasured confounding by SES could bias the observed effect away from the null (bias-corrected OR: 2.06, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.64).","612":"Surveillance of online negative sentiment towards racially vulnerable population groups can be captured using social media. This has potential to identify early warning signals for symptoms of mental well-being among targeted groups at the population level.Tweets containing the terms Mexican(s) and Hispanic(s) were collected within a 20-week period of the 2016 United States presidential election (November 9th 2016). Sentiment analysis was used to capture percent negative tweets. A time series lag regression model was used to examine the association between percent count of negative tweets mentioning Mexicans and Hispanics and percent count of worry among Hispanic Gallup poll respondents.Of 2,809,641 tweets containing terms Mexican(s) and Hispanic(s), 687,291 tweets were negative. Among 8,314 Hispanic Gallup respondents, a mean of 33.5% responded to be worried on a daily basis. A significant lead time of 1 week was observed, showing that negative tweets mentioning Mexicans and Hispanics appeared to forecast daily worry among Hispanics by 1 week.The purpose was to use Twitter to conduct online surveillance of negative sentiment towards Mexicans and Hispanics during the 2016 United States presidential election, and to examine its relationship with mental well-being in this targeted group at the population level.","613":"Stochastic processes play an important role in the infectious disease dynamics of wildlife, especially in species subject to large population oscillations. Here, we study the case of a free ranging population of yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis) in northern Italy, where circulation of Dobrava-Belgrade hantavirus (DOBV) has been detected intermittently since 2001, until an outbreak emerged in 2010. We analysed the transmission dynamics of the recent outbreak using a computational model that accounts for seasonal changes of the host population and territorial behaviour. Model parameters were informed by capture-mark-recapture data collected over 14\u00a0years and longitudinal seroprevalence data from 2010 to 2013. The intermittent observation of DOBV before 2010 can be interpreted as repeated stochastic fadeouts after multiple introductions of infectious rodents migrating from neighbouring areas. We estimated that only 20% of introductions in a na\u00efve host population results in sustained transmission after 2\u00a0years, despite an effective reproduction number well above the epidemic threshold (mean 4\u00b75, 95% credible intervals, CI: 0\u00b765-15\u00b78). Following the 2010 outbreak, DOBV has become endemic in the study area, but we predict a constant probability of about 4\u00b77% per year that infection dies out, following large population drops in winter. In the absence of stochastic fadeout, viral prevalence is predicted to continue its growth to an oscillating equilibrium around a value of 24% (95% CI: 3-57). We presented an example of invasion dynamics of a zoonotic virus where stochastic fadeout have played a major role and may induce future extinction of the endemic infection.","614":"Acute (non-specialist) trusts with a type 1 (ie, 24\u2009hours\/day, consultant-led) accident and emergency department (n=125), Nightingale (field) hospitals (n=7) and independent sector secondary care providers (n=195).At peak availability, there were 2711 additional beds compatible with mechanical ventilation across England, reflecting a 53% increase in capacity, and occupancy never exceeded 62%. A consequence of the repurposing of beds meant that at the trough there were 8.7% (8508) fewer general and acute beds across England, but occupancy never exceeded 72%. The closest to full occupancy of general and acute bed (surge) capacity that any trust in England reached was 99.8% . For beds compatible with mechanical ventilation there were 326 trust-days (3.7%) spent above 85% of surge capacity and 154 trust-days (1.8%) spent above 92%. 23 trusts spent a cumulative 81 days at 100% saturation of their surge ventilator bed capacity (median number of days per trust=1, range: 1-17). However, only three sustainability and transformation partnerships (aggregates of geographically co-located trusts) reached 100% saturation of their mechanical ventilation beds.In this study, we describe the pattern of bed occupancy across England during the peak of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.Throughout the first wave of the pandemic, an adequate supply of all bed types existed at a national level. However, due to an unequal distribution of bed utilisation, many trusts spent a significant period operating above 'safe-occupancy' thresholds despite substantial capacity in geographically co-located trusts, a key operational issue to address in preparing for future waves.Two thresholds for 'safe occupancy' were used: 85% as per the Royal College of Emergency Medicine and 92% as per NHS Improvement.All non-specialist secondary care providers in England from 27 March27to 5 June 2020.Descriptive survey.","615":"Starting from historic reflections, the current SARS-CoV-2 induced COVID-19 pandemic is examined from various perspectives, in terms of what it implies for the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, the modeling and monitoring of the epidemic, the development of early-warning systems, the study of mortality, prevalence estimation, diagnostic and serological testing, vaccine development, and ultimately clinical trials. Emphasis is placed on how the pandemic had led to unprecedented speed in methodological and clinical development, the pitfalls thereof, but also the opportunities that it engenders for national and international collaboration, and how it has simplified and sped up procedures. We also study the impact of the pandemic on clinical trials in other indications. We note that it has placed biostatistics, epidemiology, virology, infectiology, and vaccinology, and related fields in the spotlight in an unprecedented way, implying great opportunities, but also the need to communicate effectively, often amidst controversy.","616":"For 6340 early enrollers and 25\u2009857 established enrollers, there were no differences in sex (61% female), age (median 37 years) or location (65% urban). ART refill intervals were longer for established versus early enrollers (72% vs 55% were given 4-6\u2009months refills). LTFU at 18 months was 3% (192 of 6340) for early enrollers and 5% (24 646 of 25 857) for established enrollers. Early enrollers were 41% less likely to be LTFU than established patients (adjusted risk ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.68).LTFU (>30\u2009days late for scheduled visit) at 18 months for 'early enrollers' (DSD enrolment after <6 months on ART) and 'established enrollers' (DSD enrolment after \u22656 months on ART). We used a log-binomial model to compare LTFU risk, adjusting for age, sex, location, ART refill interval and DSD model.Patients enrolled in DSD after <6 months of ART were more likely to be retained than patients established on ART prior to DSD enrolment. A limitation is that early enrollers may have been selected for DSD due to providers' and patients' expectations about future retention. Offering DSD models to ART patients soon after ART initiation may help address high attrition during the early treatment period.Retrospective cohort study using routinely collected electronic medical record data.Patient attrition is high the first 6\u2009months after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. Patients with <6 months of ART are systematically excluded from most differentiated service delivery (DSD) models, which are intended to support retention. Despite DSD eligibility criteria requiring \u22656 months on ART, some patients enrol earlier. We compared loss to follow-up (LTFU) between patients enrolling in DSD models early with those enrolled according to guidelines, assessing whether the ART experience eligibility criterion is necessary.PARTICIPANTS: Adults (\u226515 years) who initiated ART between 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2020.NCT04158882.","617":"Bed bug outbreaks pose a major challenge in urban environments and cause significant strain on public resources. Few studies have systematically analyzed this insect epidemic or the potential effects of policies to combat bed bugs. Here we use three sources of administrative data to characterize the spatial-temporal trends of bed bug inquiries, complaints, and reports in New York City. Bed bug complaints have significantly decreased (p < 0.01) from 2014-2020, the absolute number of complaints per month dropping by half (875 average complaints per month to 440 average complaints per month); conversely, complaints for other insects including cockroaches and flies did not decrease over the same period. Despite the decrease of bed bug complaints, areas with reported high bed bug infestation tend to remain infested, highlighting the persistence of these pests. There are limitations to the datasets; still the evidence available suggests that interventions employed by New York City residents and lawmakers are stemming the bed bug epidemic and may serve as a model for other large cities.","618":"Seasonal influenza vaccine (SIV) uptake among US adults aged 65 years or older remains suboptimal and stagnant. Further, there is growing concern around racial and ethnic disparities in uptake. We aimed to assess racial and ethnic disparities in overall SIV and in high-dose vaccine (HDV) uptake among Medicare beneficiaries during the 2015-16 influenza season and sought to identify possible mediators for observed disparities.We did a historical record-linkage cohort study using Medicare (a US national health insurance programme) databases, which included all older adults (\u226565 years) enrolled in Medicare during the study period (July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2016). We excluded beneficiaries of Medicare Part C (managed care offered by private companies), and residents of long-term care facilities. The primary outcome was SIV receipt during the study period, classified into receipt of HDV and standard-dose vaccines (SDVs, representing all other SIVs). SIV uptake probabilities were estimated using competing-risk survival analysis methods. Mediation analyses were done to investigate potential mediators of the association between race and ethnicity and uptake.Substantial racial and ethnic disparities in SIV uptake among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older are evident. New legislative, fiscal, and educational strategies are urgently needed to address these inequities.Sanofi Pasteur.During the study period, of 26\u00b75 million beneficiaries in the study cohort, 47\u00b74% received a SIV, 52\u00b77% of whom received HDV. Compared with white beneficiaries (49\u00b74%), Hispanic (29\u00b71%), Black (32\u00b76%), and Asian (47\u00b76%) beneficiaries were less likely to be vaccinated and, when vaccinated, were less likely to receive HDV (37\u00b78% for Hispanic people, 41\u00b71% for Black people, and 40\u00b73% for Asian people, compared with 53\u00b78% of white people who received HDV). Among those vaccinated, after accounting for region, income, chronic conditions, and health-care use, minority groups were 26-32% less likely to receive HDV, relative to white people (odds ratio [OR] 0\u00b768 [95% CI 0\u00b768-0\u00b769] for Black people; OR 0\u00b771 [0\u00b771-0\u00b772] for Asian people; and OR 0\u00b774 [0\u00b773-0\u00b774] for Hispanic people).","619":"The Human Immunomics Initiative (HII), a joint project between the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Human Vaccines Project (HVP), focuses on studying immunity and the predictability of immuneresponsiveness to vaccines in aging populations. This paper describes the hypotheses and methodological approaches of this new collaborative initiative. Central to our thinking is the idea that predictors of age-related non-communicable diseases are the same as predictors for infectious diseases like COVID-19 and influenza. Fundamental to our approach is to differentiate between chronological, biological and immune age, and to use existing large-scale population cohorts. The latter provide well-typed phenotypic data on individuals' health status over time, readouts of routine clinical biochemical biomarkers to determine biological age, and bio-banked plasma samples to deep phenotype humoral immune responses as biomarkers of immune age. The first phase of the program involves 1.\u00a0the exploration of biological age, humoral biomarkers of immune age, and genetics in a large multigenerational cohort, and 2.\u00a0the subsequent development of models of immunity in relation to health status in a second, prospective cohort of an aging population. In the second phase, vaccine responses and efficacy of licensed COVID-19 vaccines\u00a0in the presence and absence of influenza-, pneumococcal- and pertussis vaccines routinely offered to elderly,\u00a0will be studied in older aged participants of prospective population-based cohorts in different geographical locations who will be selected for representing distinct biological and immune ages.

During new epidemics, public health officials face difficult decisions regarding spatial targeting of interventions to optimally allocate limited resources. We used a large-scale, data-driven, agent-based simulation model (ABM) to explore CHIKV mitigation strategies, including strategies based on previous DENV outbreaks. Our model represents CHIKV transmission in a realistic population of Colombia with 45 million individuals in 10.6 million households, schools, and workplaces. Our model uses high-resolution probability maps for the occurrence of the Ae. aegypti mosquito vector to estimate mosquito density in Colombia. We found that vector control in all 521 municipalities with mosquito populations led to 402,940 fewer clinical cases of CHIKV compared to a baseline scenario without intervention. We also explored using data about previous dengue virus (DENV) epidemics to inform CHIKV mitigation strategies. Compared to the baseline scenario, 314,437 fewer cases occurred when we simulated vector control only in 301 municipalities that had previously reported DENV, illustrating the value of available data from previous outbreaks. When varying the implementation parameters for vector control, we found that faster implementation and scale-up of vector control led to the greatest proportionate reduction in cases. Using available data for epidemic simulations can strengthen decision making against new epidemic threats.","621":"Despite remarkable progress in the reduction of malaria incidence, this disease remains a public health threat to a significant portion of the world's population. Surveillance, combined with early detection algorithms, can be an effective intervention strategy to inform timely public health responses to potential outbreaks. Our main objective was to compare the potential for detecting malaria outbreaks by selected event detection methods.All of the methods evaluated performed better than a na\u00efve random alarm generator. We also found distinct trade-offs between the percent of events detected and the percent of true positive alarms. CDC EARS and weekly statistical threshold methods had high event sensitivities (80-100% CDC; 57-100% weekly statistical) and low to moderate alarm specificities (25-40% CDC; 16-61% weekly statistical). Farrington variants had a wide range of scores (20-100% sensitivities; 16-100% specificities) and could achieve various balances between sensitivity and specificity.Of the methods tested, we found that the Farrington improved method was most effective at maximizing both the percent of events detected and true positive alarms for our dataset (>\u200970% sensitivity and\u2009>\u200970% specificity). This method uses statistical models to establish thresholds while controlling for seasonality and multi-year trends, and we suggest that it and other model-based approaches should be considered more broadly for malaria early detection.We used historical surveillance data with weekly counts of confirmed Plasmodium falciparum (including mixed) cases from the Amhara region of Ethiopia, where there was a resurgence of malaria in 2019 following several years of declining cases. We evaluated three methods for early detection of the 2019 malaria events: 1) the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) Early Aberration Reporting System (EARS), 2) methods based on weekly statistical thresholds, including the WHO and Cullen methods, and 3) the Farrington methods.","622":"Recent advancements in 3D modeling have revolutionized various fields, including virtual reality, computer-aided diagnosis, and architectural design, emphasizing the importance of accurate quality assessment for 3D point clouds. As these models undergo operations such as simplification and compression, introducing distortions can significantly impact their visual quality. There is a growing need for reliable and efficient objective quality evaluation methods to address this challenge. In this context, this paper introduces a novel methodology to assess the quality of 3D point clouds using a deep learning-based no-reference (NR) method. First, it extracts geometric and perceptual attributes from distorted point clouds and represent them as a set of 1D vectors. Then, transfer learning is applied to obtain high-level features using a 1D convolutional neural network (1D CNN) adapted from 2D CNN models through weight conversion from ImageNet. Finally, quality scores are predicted through regression utilizing fully connected layers. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated across diverse datasets, including the Colored Point Cloud Quality Assessment Database (SJTU_PCQA), the Waterloo Point Cloud Assessment Database (WPC), and the Colored Point Cloud Quality Assessment Database featured at ICIP2020. The outcomes reveal superior performance compared to several competing methodologies, as evidenced by enhanced correlation with average opinion scores.","623":"This retrospective cohort study included the households of all laboratory-confirmed or clinically confirmed COVID-19 cases and laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections identified by the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention between Dec 2, 2019, and April 18, 2020. We defined households as groups of family members and close relatives who did not necessarily live at the same address and considered households that shared common contacts as epidemiologically linked. We used a statistical transmission model to estimate household secondary attack rates and to quantify risk factors associated with infectivity and susceptibility to infection, accounting for individual-level exposure history. We assessed how intervention policies affected the household reproductive number, defined as the mean number of household contacts a case can infect.Within households, children and adolescents were less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection but were more infectious than older individuals. Presymptomatic cases were more infectious and individuals with asymptomatic infection less infectious than symptomatic cases. These findings have implications for devising interventions for blocking household transmission of SARS-CoV-2, such as timely vaccination of eligible children once resources become available.27\u2008101 households with 29\u2008578 primary cases and 57\u2008581 household contacts were identified. The secondary attack rate estimated with the transmission model was 15\u00b76% (95% CI 15\u00b72-16\u00b70), assuming a mean incubation period of 5 days and a maximum infectious period of 22 days. Individuals aged 60 years or older were at a higher risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 than all other age groups. Infants aged 0-1 years were significantly more likely to be infected than children aged 2-5 years (odds ratio [OR] 2\u00b720, 95% CI 1\u00b740-3\u00b744) and children aged 6-12 years (1\u00b753, 1\u00b701-2\u00b734). Given the same exposure time, children and adolescents younger than 20 years of age were more likely to infect others than were adults aged 60 years or older (1\u00b758, 1\u00b728-1\u00b795). Asymptomatic individuals were much less likely to infect others than were symptomatic cases (0\u00b721, 0\u00b714-0\u00b731). Symptomatic cases were more likely to infect others before symptom onset than after (1\u00b742, 1\u00b730-1\u00b755). After mass isolation of cases, quarantine of household contacts, and restriction of movement policies were implemented, household reproductive numbers declined by 52% among primary cases (from 0\u00b725 [95% CI 0\u00b724-0\u00b726] to 0\u00b712 [0\u00b710-0\u00b713]) and by 63% among secondary cases (from 0\u00b717 [0\u00b716-0\u00b718] to 0\u00b7063 [0\u00b7057-0\u00b7070]).National Natural Science Foundation of China, Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, US National Institutes of Health, and US National Science Foundation.Wuhan was the first epicentre of COVID-19 in the world, accounting for 80% of cases in China during the first wave.

In infectious disease epidemiology, frailty models have been proposed to model heterogeneity in the acquisition of infection and to accommodate association in the occurrence of multiple types of infection. Although traditional frailty models rely on the assumption of lifelong immunity after recovery, refinements have been made to account for reinfections with the same pathogen. Recently, Abrams and Hens quantified the effect of misspecifying the underlying infection process on the basic and effective reproduction number in the context of bivariate current status data on parvovirus B19 and varicella zoster virus. Furthermore, Farrington, Unkel and their co-workers introduced and applied time varying shared frailty models to paired bivariate serological data. In this paper, we consider an extension of the proposed frailty methodology by Abrams and Hens to account for age-dependence in individual heterogeneity through the use of age-dependent shared and correlated gamma frailty models. The methodology is illustrated by using two data applications.","625":"Efforts to prevent intimate partner violence (IPV) have been informed by emerging research on common triggers of IPV and the importance of engaging with couple dynamics. This paper reports on secondary data analysis from the qualitative evaluations of the SASA! intervention in Uganda, (conducted in 2012 involving 40 community members) and the Indashyikirwa intervention in Rwanda, (conducted between 2014 and 2018 involving 14 couples and 36 other stakeholders). It explores the under-researched linkages between romantic jealousy and IPV, and describes how these interventions mitigated it. A qualitative approach using interviews and focus groups with women and men was used. Overall, jealousy was common in both settings, and led to relationship challenges including breakdown of trust; quarrels about resources; conflict, controlling behaviours, and ultimately, physical and emotional IPV. Jealousy was seen to operate through different gendered pathways. Participants described women to question men about their whereabouts and intentions because of jealousy or the suspicion of infidelity, whereas participants described men to be jealous or suspicious of women socialising with, or attracting the attention of, other men and using violence in response. Through gender transformative strategies, SASA! and Indashyikirwa were described by participants to reduce the contribution of romantic jealousy to conflict and violence by encouraging improved relationship faithfulness and honesty; supporting reduced suspicion through improved relationship trust and communication; and identifying jealousy and suspicion of, or real infidelity, as direct triggers of IPV. While these programmes show promising results, gaps remain including a lack of standardised measures of the multidimensional concept of romantic jealousy. Recognition that programmes should be evaluated for their ability to reduce romantic jealousy when identified as a trigger for IPV in a specific context should also be emphasised. More research is also needed on the forms, gendered pathways, and consequences of romantic jealousy to inform context-specific programming.","626":"A greater proportion of individuals reporting sexual violence also reported substance use disorders compared to the general population of individuals. While 8% of all ED visits were related to SU, 17% of ED visits involving SV were also related to SU, demonstrating a statistically significant association between SV and SU.Data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project was used to examine the relationship between SV and SU. The database contained 3.5 million observations for 24 Hawaii hospitals from 2005-2014. The data was summarized in descriptive statistics and Chi-square tests were run to assess statistical significance for variables of interest.Substance use (SU) and sexual violence (SV) present unique challenges when contextualizing their relationship due to underreporting of SU and SV. Both are significant public health concerns with a large magnitude and expense to the overall U.S. and to the state of Hawaii, which is identified as a high-intensity drug-trafficking area. Since substance users have a higher risk for sexual violence than the general public, this study aims to analyze the proportion and demographics of emergency department (ED) visit individuals reporting sexual violence with or without substance use disorder and examine how the number of ED visits of individuals diagnosed with SV and SU disorder compare to all individuals.There is a greater need to further understand the complexity of the relationship between substance use and sexual violence. Sexual violence and substance use disorders share a complex relationship; survivors of sexual abuse may develop a substance use disorder, and those who use drugs and alcohol may be at an increased risk for sexual violence. Results from this study demonstrate visits for individuals reporting sexual violence have a greater proportion of substance use disorder than visits for the general population.","627":"Results obtained in randomized trials may not easily generalize to target populations. Whereas in randomized trials the treatment assignment mechanism is known, the sampling mechanism by which individuals are selected to participate in the trial is typically not known and assuming random sampling from the target population is often dubious. We consider an inverse probability of sampling weighted (IPSW) estimator for generalizing trial results to a target population. The IPSW estimator is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. A consistent sandwich-type variance estimator is derived and simulation results are presented comparing the IPSW estimator to a previously proposed stratified estimator. The methods are then utilized to generalize results from two randomized trials of HIV treatment to all people living with HIV in the United States.","628":"Both self-report and PA-SIIS are good estimates of actual vaccine uptake. When high accuracy data are required, such as for vaccine effectiveness studies, triangulation using multiple sources should be conducted.Many vaccination studies rely on self-reported vaccination status, with its inherent biases. Accuracy of influenza vaccination self-report has been evaluated periodically, typically using the medical record as the gold standard. The burgeoning of electronic medical records (EMRs) and immunization information systems (IISs) and the rise of adult vaccine administration in community pharmacies suggest the need for a reevaluation of self-reported vaccination status.Vaccination data from self-report, the state IIS, the health system EMR and other sources were compared for participants in outpatient and inpatient influenza vaccine effectiveness studies for four seasons (2016-2017 to 2019-2020). Agreement among the sources was calculated along with sensitivity and specificity. Tests for trend assessed changes in completeness of the Pennsylvania - Statewide IIS (PA-SIIS) data over time.With self-report as the gold standard, agreement with the local EMR, PA-SIIS, and all sources was 62%, 77% and 85%, respectively. Sensitivity of the EMR was 42% (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a041, 43) and specificity was 91% (90, 92). With PA-SIIS-as the gold standard, agreement with the local EMR and all sources was 77% and 78%, respectively. Sensitivity of all sources combined was 96% (95, 97) and specificity was (63% (62, 64). Capture of influenza vaccinations in the IIS has not consistently improved over time, with a significant increase among children (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), no change among working-age adults and a decrease among older adults (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004). However, PA-SIIS provided the largest percentage of verified vaccines (69.3%) compared with EMR (43.3%) and other sources (12.4%).","629":"This article uses the theoretical framework of the networked public to understand the dynamics of online harassment of public health professionals. Coauthors draw on their experiences with health communication on social media, in a local public health department, and in news media to illustrate the utility of this framework. Their stories also highlight the need to build a more proactive approach to online harassment in public health. The coauthors highlight recommendations that health communicators can take in the face of online harassment. We also call for a more coordinated community effort to create supportive environments for online health communication, including increased funding of local health departments and increased regulation of social media companies.","630":"With its fifth edition, the Mediterranean School of Complex Networks is one of the oldest international summer schools, run without interruptions, which is fully devoted to teach the fundamentals of Network Science and its current trends to early-career researchers.","631":"To describe the geographical heterogeneity of COVID-19 across prefectures in mainland China, we estimated doubling times from daily time series of the cumulative case count between 24 January and 24 February 2020. We analyzed the prefecture-level COVID-19 case burden using linear regression models and used the local Moran's I to test for spatial autocorrelation and clustering. Four hundred prefectures (~98% population) had at least one COVID-19 case and 39 prefectures had zero cases by 24 February 2020. Excluding Wuhan and those prefectures where there was only one case or none, 76 (17.3% of 439) prefectures had an arithmetic mean of the epidemic doubling time <2 d. Low-population prefectures had a higher per capita cumulative incidence than high-population prefectures during the study period. An increase in population size was associated with a very small reduction in the mean doubling time (-0.012, 95% CI, -0.017, -0.006) where the cumulative case count doubled \u22653 times. Spatial analysis revealed high case count clusters in Hubei and Heilongjiang and fast epidemic growth in several metropolitan areas by mid-February 2020. Prefectures in Hubei and neighboring provinces and several metropolitan areas in coastal and northeastern China experienced rapid growth with cumulative case count doubling multiple times with a small mean doubling time.","632":"Understanding how broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to HIV envelope (Env) develop during natural infection can help guide the rational design of an HIV vaccine. Here, we described a bnAb lineage targeting the Env V2 apex and the Ab-Env co-evolution that led to development of neutralization breadth. The lineage Abs bore an anionic heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDRH3) of 25 amino acids, among the shortest known for this class of Abs, and achieved breadth with only 10% nucleotide somatic hypermutation and no insertions or deletions. The data suggested a role for Env glycoform heterogeneity in the activation of the lineage germline B cell. Finally, we showed that localized diversity at key V2 epitope residues drove bnAb maturation toward breadth, mirroring the Env evolution pattern described for another donor who developed V2-apex targeting bnAbs. Overall, these findings suggest potential strategies for vaccine approaches based on germline-targeting and serial immunogen design.","633":"Many rural-urban indexes are utilized in cancer research. This variation introduces inconsistencies between studies. Recommendations on index use have prioritized geographical unit over feasibility of inclusion in analysis. We evaluated rural-urban indexes and recommend one for use to increase comparability across studies.Urban\/rural patient categorization changed with index selection. We conclude that RUCC is an appropriate and feasible rural-urban index to include in cancer research, as it is standardly available in national cancer registries, can be matched to patient's county of residence for local research, and it had the least amount of fluctuation of the indices analyzed. Utilizing RUCC as a continuous variable across studies with a rural-urban component will increase reproducibility and comparability of results and eliminate rural-urban index choice as a potential source of discrepancy between studies.Six indexes categorized rural and urban areas. Indexes agreed on binary rural-urban designation for 88.8% of the US population. As ternary variables, they agreed for 83.4%. For cancer registry patients, this decreased to 73.4% and 60.4% agreement, respectively. Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC) performed the best in differentiating metropolitan, micropolitan, and rural counties; availability for retrospective and prospective studies; and continuous coding for analysis.We assessed 9 US rural-urban indexes regarding their respective rural and urban code ranges; geographical unit, land area, and population distributions; percent agreement; suitability for analysis; and integration feasibility for national, state, and local cancer research. We referenced 1569 Wisconsin Pancreatic Cancer Registry patients to demonstrate how index choice affects patient categorization.","634":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is straining health systems around the world. Although the Chinese government implemented a number of severe restrictions on people's movement in an attempt to contain its local and international spread, the virus had already reached many areas of the world in part due to its potent transmissibility and the fact that a substantial fraction of infected individuals develop little or no symptoms at all. Following its emergence, the virus started to generate sustained transmission in neighboring countries in Asia, Western Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States, and finally in South America and Africa. As the virus continues its global spread, a clear and evidence-based understanding of properties and dynamics of the global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to design and put in place efficient and globally coordinated interventions.The analysis suggest multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the majority of world regions by means of heterogeneous transmission pathways. The transmission network is scale-free, with a few genomic variants responsible for the majority of possible transmissions. The network structure is in line with the available temporal information represented by sample collection times and suggest the expected sampling time difference of few days between potential transmission pairs. The inferred network structural properties, transmission clusters and pathways and virus introduction routes emphasize the extent of the global epidemiological linkage and demonstrate the importance of internationally coordinated public health measures.We employ molecular surveillance data of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics for inference and comprehensive analysis of its global transmission network before the pandemic declaration. Our goal was to characterize the spatial-temporal transmission pathways that led to the establishment of the pandemic. We exploited a network-based approach specifically tailored to emerging outbreak settings. Specifically, it traces the accumulation of mutations in viral genomic variants via mutation trees, which are then used to infer transmission networks, revealing an up-to-date picture of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 between and within countries and geographic regions.","635":"Wastewater treatment plants act as socio-ecological couplers through the concentration, treatment, and subsequent environmental release of sewage collected from surrounding communities and are often considered hotspots for antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). While studies have identified the release of ARB\/ARGs in treated liquid sewage, little is known about potential dispersal through wastewater bioaerosol emissions. The aim of this study was to better define the contribution of WWTP bioaerosols to potential environmental distribution of ARB\/ARGs. Bioaerosols were collected immediately upwind and downwind from the aeration tanks of a municipal wastewater treatment plant and liquid sludge samples were obtained from the aeration tanks. From the bioaerosol and liquid samples, qPCR assays identified 44 ARGs that confer resistance to a wide range of antibiotics. Comparison of the ARG profiles across samples showed that the downwind bioaerosol profile was 68% similar to the profile found in liquid sludge samples. Community 16S rRNA gene sequencing also showed that downwind bioaerosols had similar taxonomic profiles as those generated from liquid sludge while the upwind profiles showed a distinct difference. Preliminary ARG dispersion modeling estimated an ARG emission rate of ~10,620 genes per hour from the liquid sludge and indicated that the bioaerosols have the potential to be carried kilometers away from the WWTP source based on wind speed. The overall results from this study suggest that bioaerosols generated during WWTP processes can aid in the emission and dispersal of bacteria and ARGs, resulting in a possible route of human exposure and deposition into surrounding environments.","636":"The strong association of anosmia\/ageusia with self-reported SARS-CoV-2 test positivity is omnipresent, supporting its validity as a reliable COVID-19 signal, regardless of the participatory surveillance platform or testing policy. This analysis highlights that precise effect estimates, as well as an understanding of test access patterns to interpret differences, are best done only when incidence is high. These findings strongly support the need for testing access to be as open as possible both for real-time epidemiologic investigation and public health utility.Anosmia\/ageusia was the strongest, most consistent symptom associated with a positive COVID-19 test, based on 658325 tests (5% positive) from over 10 million respondents in three digital surveillance platforms using longitudinal and cross-sectional survey methodologies. During higher-incidence periods with broader testing criteria, core COVID-19 symptoms were more strongly associated with test status. Lower incidence periods had, overall, larger confidence intervals.Multiple participatory surveillance platforms were developed across the world in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, providing a real-time understanding of community-wide COVID-19 epidemiology. During this time, testing criteria broadened and healthcare policies matured. We sought to test whether there were consistent associations of symptoms with SARS-CoV-2 test status across three national surveillance platforms, during periods of testing and policy changes, and whether inconsistencies could better inform our understanding and future studies as the COVID-19 pandemic progresses.Four months (1st April 2020 to 31st July 2020) of observation through three volunteer COVID-19 digital surveillance platforms targeting communities in three countries (Israel, United Kingdom, and United States). Logistic regression of self-reported symptom on self-reported SARS-CoV-2 test status (or test access), adjusted for age and sex, in each of the study cohorts. Odds ratios over time were compared to known changes in testing policies and fluctuations in COVID-19 incidence.","637":"In this modelling study, we fitted an individual-based model to the HIV epidemic and HIV care cascade in 21 high prevalence communities in Zambia and South Africa that were part of the PopART cluster-randomised trial (intervention period Nov 1, 2013, to Dec 31, 2017). The model represents coverage of home-based testing and counselling by age and sex, delivered as part of the trial, antiretroviral therapy (ART) uptake, and any changes in national guidelines on ART eligibility. In PopART, communities were randomly assigned to one of three arms: arm A received the full PopART intervention for all individuals who tested positive for HIV, arm B received the intervention with ART provided in accordance with national guidelines, and arm C received standard of care. We fitted the model to trial data twice using Approximate Bayesian Computation, once before data unblinding and then again after data unblinding. We compared projections of intervention impact with observed effects, and for four different scenarios of UTT up to Jan 1, 2030 in the study communities.The long-term impact of universal home-based testing and treatment as part of universal testing and treatment (UTT) on HIV incidence is unknown. We made projections using a detailed individual-based model of the effect of the intervention delivered in the HPTN 071 (PopART) cluster-randomised trial.A widespread and continued commitment to UTT via home-based testing and counselling can have a substantial effect on HIV incidence in high prevalence communities.Compared with standard of care, a 51% (95% credible interval 40-60) reduction in HIV incidence is projected if the trial intervention (arms A and B combined) is continued from 2020 to 2030, over and above a declining trend in HIV incidence under standard of care.National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, International Initiative for Impact Evaluation, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and National Institute of Mental Health.","638":"Novel deterministic and stochastic models are proposed in this paper for the within-host dynamics of cholera, with a focus on the bacterial-viral interaction. The deterministic model is a system of differential equations describing the interaction among the two types of vibrios and the viruses. The stochastic model is a system of Markov jump processes that is derived based on the dynamics of the deterministic model. The multitype branching process approximation is applied to estimate the extinction probability of bacteria and viruses within a human host during the early stage of the bacterial-viral infection. Accordingly, a closed-form expression is derived for the disease extinction probability, and analytic estimates are validated with numerical simulations. The local and global dynamics of the bacterial-viral interaction are analysed using the deterministic model, and the result indicates that there is a sharp disease threshold characterized by the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text]: if [Formula: see text], vibrios ingested from the environment into human body will not cause cholera infection; if [Formula: see text], vibrios will grow with increased toxicity and persist within the host, leading to human cholera. In contrast, the stochastic model indicates, more realistically, that there is always a positive probability of disease extinction within the human host.","639":"Between February 24, 2022, and July 7, 2023, healthy client-owned dogs \u2265 4 years old with no evidence of lower urinary tract signs (LUTS) were recruited for a longitudinal, prospective study. Phase 1 dogs with SB were followed for 28 days to document comorbidities and microbiological findings (ie, urinalysis, urine culture, and fimH gene in Escherichia coli isolates). Phase 1 participants enrolled in phase 2 were followed for at least an additional 120 days.The prevalence of SB was 11% (11 of 99), and all were female spayed. Of those with SB, 6 (55%) were followed for a median of 238 days; 91% (10 of 11) of phase 1 dogs and 67% (4 of 6) of phase 2 dogs had persistent bacteriuria, and 1 developed pyelonephritis 299 days after enrollment. Most dogs had E coli (8 of 11 [73%]), all of which contained the fimH gene. No change in antimicrobial susceptibility was noted during follow-up.To evaluate clinical and microbial outcomes in dogs with untreated subclinical bacteriuria (SB) through longitudinal follow-up.For dogs with SB that are otherwise healthy, avoidance of systemic antimicrobials is warranted. For dogs with additional comorbidities, which might not be accompanied by, for example, pyelonephritis, or preclude the demonstration of LUTS, veterinarians should review the medical history and consider additional diagnostic testing.SB is generally nonprogressive and can persist for months after diagnosis. Patients with SB were more likely to be female, but no difference related to age, weight, or life stage was found. The presence of fimH, previously associated with biofilm, was negatively correlated with antimicrobial resistance.","640":" infection, continues to threaten low- and middle-income countries throughout the world. The complex interactions between rodents and fleas with their respective environments challenge our understanding of human plague epidemiology. Historical long-term datasets of reported plague cases offer a unique opportunity to elucidate the effects of climate on plague outbreaks in detail. Here, we analyse monthly plague deaths and climate data from 25 provinces in British India from 1898 to 1949 to generate insights into the influence of temperature, rainfall and humidity on the occurrence, severity and timing of plague outbreaks. We find that moderate relative humidity levels of between 60% and 80% were strongly associated with outbreaks. Using wavelet analysis, we determine that the nationwide spread of plague was driven by changes in humidity, where, on average, a one-month delay in the onset of rising humidity translated into a one-month delay in the timing of plague outbreaks. This work can inform modern spatio-temporal predictive models for the disease and aid in the development of early-warning strategies for the deployment of prophylactic treatments and other control measures.","641":"While general lockdowns have proven effective to control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, they come with enormous costs for society. It is therefore essential to identify control strategies with lower social and economic impact. Here, we report and evaluate the control strategy implemented during a large SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in June-July 2020 in French Guiana that relied on curfews, targeted lockdowns, and other measures. We find that the combination of these interventions coincided with a reduction in the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 from 1.7 to 1.1, which was sufficient to avoid hospital saturation. We estimate that thanks to the young demographics, the risk of hospitalisation following infection was 0.3 times that of metropolitan France and that about 20% of the population was infected by July. Our model projections are consistent with a recent seroprevalence study. The study showcases how mathematical modelling can be used to support healthcare planning in a context of high uncertainty.","642":"Trace minerals are important for animal health. Mineral deficiency or excess can negatively affect immune function, wound healing, and hoof health in domestic livestock, but normal concentrations and health impairment associated with mineral imbalances in wild animals are poorly understood. Treponeme-associated hoof disease (TAHD) is an emerging disease of free-ranging elk (Cervus canadensis) in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Selenium and copper levels identified in a small number of elk from areas where TAHD is established (i.e., southwestern Washington) suggested a mineral deficiency may have\u00a0increased susceptibility to TAHD. Our objectives were to determine trace mineral concentrations using hair from elk originating in TAHD affected areas of Washington, California, Idaho, and Oregon and assess their associations with the occurrence of the disease.Trace mineral analysis of hair is a non-invasive sampling technique that offers feasibility in storage and collection from live animals and carcasses. For some minerals, levels in hair correlate with visceral organs that are challenging to obtain. Our study using hair collected opportunistically from elk feet submitted for diagnostic investigations provides a modest reference of hair mineral levels in elk from the U.S. Pacific Northwest that may be useful in future determination of reference ranges. Although our results revealed high variability in mineral concentrations between elk, consistent relationship of possibly low selenium levels and TAHD suggest that further investigations are warranted.We identified limited associations between TAHD occurrence and severity with hair mineral concentrations in 72 free-ranging elk, using Firth's logistic regression and multinomial regression models. We found consistent support for a priori hypotheses that selenium concentration, an important mineral for hoof health, is inversely associated with the occurrence of TAHD. Less consistent support was observed for effects of other minerals previously associated with hoof health (e.g., copper or zinc) or increased disease risk from potential toxicants.","643":"We aimed to investigate the prevalence and cost-associated risk factors for hospital stays for Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) patients in the past decade.The care for NF2 patients continues to evolve over time. We report the prevalence of patient demographics, comorbidities, and treatments in the NF2 inpatient population. Further studies are warranted to better understand the risk factors for higher costs, so that patients with NF2 may continue to receive life-long quality care in a cost-effective manner.A multi-year cross-sectional study was performed using the National Inpatient Sample. Patients with a diagnosis code of NF2 according to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification coding system were queried from 2006-2014. Sampling discharge weights were used to calculate trend estimates for national demographics, hospital characteristics, comorbidities, and surgical interventions. Regression analysis was performed to determine significant independent associations between comorbidities and admission cost.From 2006-2014, there were 5,078 discharges for patients diagnosed with NF2. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and procedures performed were overall consistent over time. The most common admission diagnoses were hearing loss (28.2 %), acoustic schwannoma (14.3 %), cranial meningioma (11.8 %) and epilepsy (10.8 %). The most common procedures performed were craniotomy and meningioma resection (10.2 %) and acoustic neuroma open resection (7.9 %). The median inflation-adjusted cost of admission did not change over time, with an admission cost value of $12,387 [6,042 - 26,051]. On regression analysis, obstructive hydrocephalus, craniotomy and meningioma resection, acoustic neuroma open resection, and spine tumor resection were all independent predictors of increased cost.","644":"Kinesins are nano-sized biological motors which walk by repeating a mechanochemical cycle. A single kinesin molecule is able to transport its cargo about 1 \u03bcm in the absence of external loads. However, kinesins perform much longer range transport in cells by working collectively. This long range of transport by a team of kinesins is surprising because the motion of the cargo in cells can be hindered by other particles. To reveal how the kinesins are able to accomplish their tasks of transport in harsh intracellular circumstances, stochastic studies on the kinesin motion are performed by considering the binding and unbinding of kinesins to microtubules and their dependence on the force acting on kinesin molecules. The unbinding probabilities corresponding to each mechanochemical state of kinesin are modeled. The statistical characterization of the instants and locations of binding are captured by computing the probability of unbound kinesin being at given locations. It is predicted that a group of kinesins has a more efficient transport than a single kinesin from the perspective of velocity and run length. Particularly, when large loads are applied, the leading kinesin remains bound to the microtubule for long time which increases the chances of the other kinesins to bind to the microtubule. To predict effects of this behavior of the leading kinesin under large loads on the collective transport, the motion of the cargo is studied when the cargo confronts obstacles. The result suggests that the behavior of kinesins under large loads prevents the early termination of the transport which can be caused by the interference with the static or moving obstacles.

The model is based on the allostasis theory and uses a formal representation of a multiscale opponent process. The model simulates smoking behavior of an individual and produces both short-term (\"loading up\" after not smoking for a while) and long-term smoking patterns (e.g., gradual transition from a few cigarettes to one pack a day). By introducing a formal representation of withdrawal- and craving-like processes, the model produces gradual increases over time in withdrawal- and craving-like signals associated with abstinence and shows that after 3 months of abstinence, craving disappears. The model was programmed as a computer application allowing users to select simulation scenarios. The application links images of brain regions that are activated during the binge\/intoxication, withdrawal, or craving with corresponding simulated states. The model was calibrated to represent smoking patterns described in peer-reviewed literature; however, it is generic enough to be adapted to other drugs, including cocaine and opioids. Although the model does not mechanistically describe specific neurobiological processes, it can be useful in prevention and treatment practices as an illustration of drug-using behaviors and expected dynamics of withdrawal and craving during abstinence.","647":"Global financing for health security was dramatically impacted by COVID-19. Here, we provide an empirical analysis of how that funding changed. Using data from Global Health Security (GHS) Tracking (tracking.ghscosting.org), we analyzed disbursements of direct financial assistance for GHS from 2016 to 2022 to compare pre-pandemic funding (2016-2019) to post-pandemic funding (2020-2022) for preparedness and response during each of the seven World Health Organization-declared public health emergencies of international concern (PHEICs) from 2009 to 2022. Over $165B was disbursed for capacity-building and preparedness activities between January 2016 and December 2022, and over $76B was provided for PHEIC response. Preparedness funding remained evenly distributed since 2016 across regions, with the African region receiving about 70% of total preparedness funding. Indeed, how capacity-building and preparedness funding is distributed has changed remarkably little since 2016, despite unprecedented changes to the funding environment-including markedly increased spending-in response to COVID-19. This suggests we now have a unique opportunity to restructure how funds are tracked for accountability and assessing return on investment moving forward.","648":"(1) Background: Men frequent outpatient departments (OPD) but are underrepresented in HIV testing services throughout sub-Saharan Africa. (2) Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis on data from a community-based survey with men in rural Malawi to assess factors associated with HIV testing, and being offered testing, during men's OPD visits. We include OPD visits made by men in-need of testing as our unit of observation. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression models were conducted. (3) Results: 782 men were eligible for these analyses, with 1575 OPD visits included (median two visits per man; IQR 1-3). 17% of OPD visits resulted in HIV testing. Being offered testing (aOR 42.45; 95% CI 15.13-119.10) and satisfaction with services received (aOR 3.27; 95% CI 1.28-8.33) were significantly associated with HIV testing. 14% of OPD visits resulted in being offered HIV testing. Being married\/steady relationship (aOR 2.53; 95% CI 1.08-5.91) and having a sexual partner living with HIV (aOR 8.22; 95% CI 1.67-40.49) were significantly associated with being offered testing. (4) Conclusion: Being offered HIV testing was the strongest factor associated with testing uptake, while HIV status of sexual partner had the strongest association with being offered testing. Implementation of provider-initiated-testing should be prioritized for male OPD visits.","649":"Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) constitute a class of nucleic acid molecules within cells that do not encode proteins but play important roles in regulating gene expression, maintaining cellular homeostasis, and mediating cell signaling. This class encompasses microRNAs (miRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), transfer RNAs (tRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and others. miRNAs are pivotal in the regulation of gene expression in hematologic malignancies. Aberrant expression of lncRNAs has been confirmed in cancerous tissues, implicating their involvement in carcinogenesis or tumor suppression processes. tRNAs may induce errors or disturbances in protein synthesis, thereby affecting normal cellular function and proliferation. Moreover, circRNAs influence disease progression in tumors by modulating the expression of relevant genes, and siRNAs can inhibit tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis while inducing apoptosis. This review will elucidate the biological functions of ncRNAs in multiple myeloma (MM) and explore their potential value as therapeutic targets.","650":"Vietnam has controlled SARS-CoV-2 spread through the early introduction of mass communication, meticulous contact-tracing with strict quarantine, and international travel restrictions. The value of these interventions is supported by the high proportion of asymptomatic and imported cases, and evidence for substantial pre-symptomatic transmission.One hundred days after SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in Vietnam on January 23rd, 270 cases were confirmed, with no deaths. We describe the control measures used by the Government and their relationship with imported and domestically-acquired case numbers, with the aim of identifying the measures associated with successful SARS-CoV-2 control.Clinical and demographic data on the first 270 SARS-CoV-2 infected cases and the timing and nature of Government control measures, including numbers of tests and quarantined individuals, were analysed. Apple and Google mobility data provided proxies for population movement. Serial intervals were calculated from 33 infector-infectee pairs and used to estimate the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission events and time-varying reproduction numbers.A national lockdown was implemented between April 1st and 22nd. Around 200 000 people were quarantined and 266 122 RT-PCR tests conducted. Population mobility decreased progressively before lockdown. 60% (163\/270) of cases were imported; 43% (89\/208) of resolved infections remained asymptomatic for the duration of infection. The serial interval was 3\u00b724 days, and 27\u00b75% (95% confidence interval, 15\u00b77%-40\u00b70%) of transmissions occurred pre-symptomatically. Limited transmission amounted to a maximum reproduction number of 1\u00b715 (95% confidence interval, 0\u00b737-2\u00b736). No community transmission has been detected since April 15th.","651":"SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) causes a variety of responses in those who contract the virus, ranging from asymptomatic infections to acute respiratory failure and death. While there are likely multiple mechanisms triggering severe disease, one potential cause of severe disease is the size of the initial inoculum. For other respiratory diseases, larger initial doses lead to more severe outcomes. We investigate whether there is a similar link for SARS-CoV-2 infections using the combination of an agent-based model (ABM) and a partial differential equation model (PDM). We use the model to examine the viral time course for different sizes of initial inocula, generating dose-response curves for peak viral load, time of viral peak, viral growth rate, infection duration, and area under the viral titer curve. We find that large initial inocula lead to short infections, but with higher viral titer peaks; and that smaller initial inocula lower the viral titer peak, but make the infection last longer.","652":"The spatial distribution of dengue and its vectors (spp. Aedes) may be the widest it has ever been, and projections suggest that climate change may allow the expansion to continue. However, less work has been done to understand how climate variability and change affects dengue in regions where the pathogen is already endemic. In these areas, the waxing and waning of immunity has a large impact on temporal dynamics of cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever. Here, we use 51 years of data across 72 provinces and characterise spatiotemporal patterns of dengue in Thailand, where dengue has caused almost 1.5 million cases over the last 30 years, and examine the roles played by temperature and dynamics of immunity in giving rise to those patterns. We find that timescales of multiannual oscillations in dengue vary in space and time and uncover an interesting spatial phenomenon: Thailand has experienced multiple, periodic synchronisation events. We show that although patterns in synchrony of dengue are similar to those observed in temperature, the relationship between the two is most consistent during synchronous periods, while during asynchronous periods, temperature plays a less prominent role. With simulations from temperature-driven models, we explore how dynamics of immunity interact with temperature to produce the observed patterns in synchrony. The simulations produced patterns in synchrony that were similar to observations, supporting an important role of immunity. We demonstrate that multiannual oscillations produced by immunity can lead to asynchronous dynamics and that synchrony in temperature can then synchronise these dengue dynamics. At higher mean temperatures, immune dynamics can be more predominant, and dengue dynamics more insensitive to multiannual fluctuations in temperature, suggesting that with rising mean temperatures, dengue dynamics may become increasingly asynchronous. These findings can help underpin predictions of disease patterns as global temperatures rise.","653":"Acclimation of photosynthesis to light intensity (photoacclimation) takes days to achieve and so naturally fluctuating light presents a potential challenge where leaves may be exposed to light conditions that are beyond their window of acclimation. Experiments generally have focused on unchanging light with a relatively fixed combination of photosynthetic attributes to confer higher efficiency in those conditions. Here a controlled LED experiment and mathematical modelling was used to assess the acclimation potential of contrasting Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes following transfer to a controlled fluctuating light environment, designed to present frequencies and amplitudes more relevant to natural conditions. We hypothesize that acclimation of light harvesting, photosynthetic capacity and dark respiration are controlled independently. Two different ecotypes were selected, Wassilewskija-4 (Ws), Landsberg erecta (Ler) and a GPT2 knock out mutant on the Ws background (gpt2-), based on their differing abilities to undergo dynamic acclimation i.e. at the sub-cellular or chloroplastic scale. Results from gas exchange and chlorophyll content indicate that plants can independently regulate different components that could optimize photosynthesis in both high and low light; targeting light harvesting in low light and photosynthetic capacity in high light. Empirical modelling indicates that the pattern of 'entrainment' of photosynthetic capacity by past light history is genotype-specific. These data show flexibility of photoacclimation and variation useful for plant improvement.","654":"We developed an individual-based simulation model of US women of reproductive age to project the prevalence of AEPs under different public health strategies. The model varies each woman's risk of an AEP over time depending on fertility, contraceptive use, awareness of pregnancy, sexual activity, and drinking patterns. We used the 2013-2015 National Survey on Family Growth data set to parameterize the model.Public health efforts to prevent alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEPs) primarily focus on promoting abstinence from alcohol among women if pregnant or seeking pregnancy and using effective contraception to prevent unintended pregnancies if consuming alcohol. Little is known about how programs to improve adherence to these recommendations would affect the prevalence of AEPs.We estimate that 54% (95% uncertainty interval: 48%-59%) of pregnancies that result in a live birth in the United States are exposed to alcohol, 12% (10%-15%) are ever exposed to \u22655 alcoholic drinks in a week, and 3.0% (1.3%-4.2%) to \u22659 drinks. Unintended pregnancies (either due to contraceptive failure or sex without contraceptives) account for 80% (75%-87%) of pregnancies unknowingly exposed to alcohol. We project that public health efforts that focus only on promoting alcohol abstinence among women who are aware of their pregnancy or seeking pregnancy could reduce the prevalence of AEPs by at most 42% (36%-48%). Augmenting this strategy with efforts to avert unintended pregnancies could yield an 80% (73%-86%) reduction in the prevalence of AEPs.Promoting alcohol abstinence among women who are aware of their pregnancy or seeking pregnancy offers limited potential to reduce the prevalence of AEPs. Programs to avert unintended pregnancies are essential to achieve more substantial reductions in AEPs in the United States.","655":"Previous work investigating the impact of childhood trauma on substance use and co-occurring psychiatric disorders has primarily been conducted in adults or on specific trauma types. This limits understanding of traumas impact in childhood and how different types of traumas play a role. We sought to characterize substance use in a sample of trauma-exposed youth in the context of psychiatric comorbidities.The findings highlight the need for universal assessments of trauma, substance misuse, and mental health symptoms in youth as the presence or absence of their co-occurrence has implications for treatment.1152 youth from the Texas Childhood Trauma Research Network (TX-CTRN) that were exposed to at least one trauma meeting DSM-5 Criterion A were assessed for current substance use and psychiatric diagnoses. Latent class analysis was used to identify patterns of substance use. To characterize these patterns, we examined if demographics, number of trauma types experienced, or childhood psychiatric disorders predicted class membership.We identified four primary patterns of substance use: Non-use (66.1%), predominantly alcohol use (19.7%), predominantly cannabis use (4.5%), and polysubstance use (9.7%). Compared to the non-users, polysubstance users tended to be older, Non-Hispanic White, have experienced more types of trauma. They were also more likely to have fulfilled diagnostic criteria for suicidality and ADHD. Comparisons among the substance using classes were more nuanced.","656":"There are cases in which CKD progression is difficult to evaluate, because the changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and proteinuria sometimes show opposite directions as CKD progresses. Indices and models that enable the easy and accurate risk prediction of end-stage-kidney disease (ESKD) are indispensable to CKD therapy. In this study, we investigated whether a CKD stage coordinate transformed into a vector field (CKD potential model) accurately predicts ESKD risk. Meta-analysis of large-scale cohort studies of CKD patients in PubMed was conducted to develop the model. The distance from CKD stage G2 A1 to a patient's data on eGFR and proteinuria was defined as r. We developed the CKD potential model on the basis of the data from the meta-analysis of three previous cohort studies: ESKD risk = exp(r). Then, the model was validated using data from a cohort study of CKD patients in Japan followed up for three years (n = 1,564). Moreover, the directional derivative of the model was developed as an index of CKD progression velocity. For ESKD prediction in three years, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were adjusted for baseline characteristics. Cox proportional hazards models with spline terms showed the exponential association between r and ESKD risk (p<0.0001). The CKD potential model more accurately predicted ESKD with an adjusted AUC of 0.81 (95% CI 0.76, 0.87) than eGFR (p<0.0001). Moreover, the directional derivative of the model showed a larger adjusted AUC for the prediction of ESKD than the percent eGFR change and eGFR slope (p<0.0001). Then, a chart of the transformed CKD stage was developed for implementation in clinical settings. This study indicated that the transformed CKD stage as a vector field enables the easy and accurate estimation of ESKD risk and CKD progression and suggested that vector analysis is a useful tool for clinical studies of CKD and its related diseases.","657":"Recent progress in genomic sequencing from patient samples has allowed for the first detailed insight into the within-host genetic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.TB), revealing remarkably low levels of variation. While this has often been attributed to low mutation rates, other factors have been described, including resistance evolution (i.e., selective sweeps), widespread purifying and background selection, and, more recently, progeny skew. Here we review recent findings pertaining to the processes governing the evolutionary dynamics of M.TB, discuss their implications for improving our understanding of this important human pathogen, and make recommendations for future work. Significantly, this emerging evolutionary framework involving the joint estimation of demographic, selective, and reproductive processes is forming a new paradigm for the study of within-host pathogen evolution that will be widely applicable across organisms.","658":"To mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the Swiss government enacted restrictions on social contacts from 2020 to 2022. In addition, individuals changed their social contact behavior to limit the risk of COVID-19. In this study, we aimed to investigate the changes in social contact patterns of the Swiss population. As part of the CoMix study, we conducted a survey consisting of 24 survey waves from January 2021 to May 2022. We collected data on social contacts and constructed contact matrices for the age groups 0-4, 5-14, 15-29, 30-64, and 65 years and older. We estimated the change in contact numbers during the COVID-19 pandemic to a synthetic pre-pandemic contact matrix. We also investigated the association of the largest eigenvalue of the social contact and transmission matrices with the stringency of pandemic measures, the effective reproduction number (Re), and vaccination uptake. During the pandemic period, 7084 responders reported an average number of 4.5 contacts (95% confidence interval, CI: 4.5-4.6) per day overall, which varied by age and survey wave. Children aged 5-14 years had the highest number of contacts with 8.5 (95% CI: 8.1-8.9) contacts on average per day and participants that were 65 years and older reported the fewest (3.4, 95% CI: 3.2-3.5) per day. Compared with the pre-pandemic baseline, we found that the 15-29 and 30-64 year olds had the largest reduction in contacts. We did not find statistically significant associations between the largest eigenvalue of the social contact and transmission matrices and the stringency of measures, Re, or vaccination uptake. The number of social contacts in Switzerland fell during the COVID-19 pandemic and remained below pre-pandemic levels after contact restrictions were lifted. The collected social contact data will be critical in informing modeling studies on the transmission of respiratory infections in Switzerland and to guide pandemic preparedness efforts.","659":"South Korea is experiencing the largest outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections outside the Arabian Peninsula, with 166 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 24 deaths up to 19 June 2015. We estimated that the mean incubation period was 6.7 days and the mean serial interval 12.6 days. We found it unlikely that infectiousness precedes symptom onset. Based on currently available data, we predict an overall case fatality risk of 21% (95% credible interval: 14\u201331).","660":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to a global pandemic of significant severity. In addition to its high level of contagiousness, COVID-19 can have a heterogeneous clinical course, ranging from asymptomatic carriers to severe and potentially life-threatening health complications. Many patients have to revisit the emergency room (ER) within a short time after discharge, which significantly increases the workload for medical staff. Early identification of such patients is crucial for helping physicians focus on treating life-threatening cases. In this study, we obtained Electronic Health Records (EHRs) of 3,210 encounters from 13 affiliated ERs within the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center between March 2020 and January 2021. We leveraged a Natural Language Processing technique, ScispaCy, to extract clinical concepts and used the 1001 most frequent concepts to develop 7-day revisit models for COVID-19 patients in ERs. The research data we collected were obtained from 13 ERs, which may have distributional differences that could affect the model development. To address this issue, we employed a classic deep transfer learning method called the Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) and evaluated different modeling strategies, including the Multi-DANN algorithm (which considers the source differences), the Single-DANN algorithm (which doesn't consider the source differences), and three baseline methods: using only source data, using only target data, and using a mixture of source and target data. Results showed that the Multi-DANN models outperformed the Single-DANN models and baseline models in predicting revisits of COVID-19 patients to the ER within 7 days after discharge (median AUROC = 0.8 vs. 0.5). Notably, the Multi-DANN strategy effectively addressed the heterogeneity among multiple source domains and improved the adaptation of source data to the target domain. Moreover, the high performance of Multi-DANN models indicates that EHRs are informative for developing a prediction model to identify COVID-19 patients who are very likely to revisit an ER within 7 days after discharge.","661":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389\/fvets.2021.640339.].","662":"We used data from 290,488 lab-confirmed COVID-19 patients who participated in a telehealth service in Bangladesh between May 2020 and June 2021, linked with COVID-19 death data from a national database to study the risk factors associated with mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between risk factors and mortality. We used classification and regression trees to identify the risk factors that are the most important for clinical decision-making.This study is one of the largest prospective cohort studies of COVID-19 mortality in a LMIC, covering 36% of all lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country during the study period. We found that being male, being very young or elderly, having low socioeconomic status, chronic kidney and liver disease, and being infected during the latter pandemic period were significantly associated with a higher risk of mortality from COVID-19. Males had 1.15 times higher odds (95% Confidence Interval, CI: 1.09, 1.22) of death compared to females. Compared to the reference age group (20-24 years olds), the odds ratio of mortality increased monotonically with age, ranging from an odds ratio of 1.35 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.73) for ages 30-34 to an odds ratio of 21.6 (95% CI: 17.08, 27.38) for ages 75-79 year group. For children 0-4 years old the odds of mortality were 3.93 (95% CI: 2.74, 5.64) times higher than 20-24 years olds. Other significant predictors were severe symptoms of COVID-19 such as breathing difficulty, fever, and diarrhea. Patients who were assessed by a physician as having a severe episode of COVID-19 based on the telehealth interview had 12.43 (95% CI: 11.04, 13.99) times higher odds of mortality compared to those assessed to have a mild episode. The finding that the telehealth doctors' assessment of disease severity was highly predictive of subsequent COVID-19 mortality, underscores the feasibility and value of the telehealth services.Our findings confirm the universality of certain COVID-19 risk factors-such as gender and age-while highlighting other risk factors that appear to be more (or less) relevant in the context of Bangladesh. These findings on the demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical risk factors for COVID-19 mortality can help guide public health and clinical decision-making. Harnessing the benefits of the telehealth system and optimizing care for those most at risk of mortality, particularly in the context of a LMIC, are the key takeaways from this study.Estimating the contribution of risk factors of mortality due to COVID-19 is particularly important in settings with low vaccination coverage and limited public health and clinical resources. Very few studies of risk factors of COVID-19 mortality used high-quality data at an individual level from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We examined the contribution of demographic, socioeconomic and clinical risk factors of COVID-19 mortality in Bangladesh, a lower middle-income country in South Asia.","663":"Dengue virus (DENV) is a public health challenge across the tropics and subtropics. Currently, there is no licensed prophylactic or antiviral treatment for dengue. The novel DENV inhibitor JNJ-1802 can significantly reduce viral load in mice and non-human primates. Here, using a mechanistic viral kinetic model calibrated against viral RNA data from experimental in-vitro infection studies, we assess the in-vitro inhibitory effect of JNJ-1802 by characterising infection dynamics of two DENV-2 strains in the absence and presence of different JNJ-1802 concentrations. Viral RNA suppression to below the limit of detection was achieved at concentrations of >1.6 nM, with a median concentration exhibiting 50% of maximal inhibitory effect (IC50) of 1.23x10-02 nM and 1.28x10-02 nM for the DENV-2\/RL and DENV-2\/16681 strains, respectively. This work provides important insight into the in-vitro inhibitory effect of JNJ-1802 and presents a first step towards a modelling framework to support characterization of viral kinetics and drug effect across different host systems.","664":"We developed a dynamic model of HIV-HPV co-infection and disease progression, which we calibrated to KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Our baseline scenario reflects the current practice of HPV vaccination with a multi-visit screening and treatment strategy involving cytology and colposcopy triage. We evaluated 13 comparator scenarios with increased vaccination coverage and one-time, two-time or repeat HIV-targeted cervical cancer screening with the following single-visit strategies: HPV DNA testing, HPV genotyping, automated visual evaluation (AVE) and HPV DNA with AVE triage. In all scenarios, HIV antiretroviral therapy, condom use and voluntary male medical circumcision continue at baseline levels. We simulated cancer incidence under each scenario from 2020 to 2120 using the 25 best-fitting parameter sets. We present the median and range of model output from these simulations to account for parameter uncertainty.In settings with high HIV prevalence, cervical cancer incidence rates are up to six-fold higher than the global average of 13.1 cases per 100,000 women-years. To inform strategies for global cervical cancer elimination, we used a dynamic transmission model to evaluate scalable screening and treatment strategies, accounting for HIV-associated cancer risks and weighing prevention gains against overtreatment.Single-visit screening strategies could avert a substantial burden of cervical cancer and accelerate progress towards elimination in settings with a high burden of HIV. Increasing the screening frequency among women with HIV and reducing loss-to-follow-up for treatment will be key components of a successful elimination strategy.We estimate that cervical cancer incidence will decrease by 87% with the continuation of current cervical cancer and HIV prevention strategies, from an age-standardized rate per 100,000 women of 80.4 (range 58.2, 112.1) in 2020 to 10.7 (4.2, 29.9) in 2120. Scenarios scaling up vaccination and single-visit strategies resulted in near- and long-term gains. With repeat HIV-targeted screening, incidence rates were projected to be 29-34% lower in 2030 relative to the baseline scenario, and elimination (incidence <4\/100,000) was achieved with HPV DNA testing in 2095 and with AVE in 2114. A strategy of HPV DNA with AVE triage optimized the tradeoff between cancer cases averted and overtreatment.","665":"A key characteristic of Plasmodium vivax parasites is their ability to adopt a latent liver-stage form called hypnozoites, able to cause relapse of infection months or years after a primary infection. Relapses of infection through hypnozoite activation are a major contributor to blood-stage infections in P vivax endemic regions and are thought to be influenced by factors such as febrile infections which may cause temporary changes in hypnozoite activation leading to 'temporal heterogeneity' in reactivation risk. In addition, immunity and variation in exposure to infection may be longer-term characteristics of individuals that lead to 'population heterogeneity' in hypnozoite activation. We analyze data on risk of P vivax in two previously published data sets from Papua New Guinea and the Thailand-Myanmar border region. Modeling different mechanisms of reactivation risk, we find strong evidence for population heterogeneity, with 30% of patients having almost 70% of all P vivax infections. Model fitting and data analysis indicates that individual variation in relapse risk is a primary source of heterogeneity of P vivax risk of recurrences.

This method becomes a trendsetter in bringing the metaverse into vivo life. It has initially captured the attention of macroscopic biology, as demonstrated by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, which provide a 3D field of view for diagnostic biological images. Meanwhile, it has also opened up new research opportunities in microscopic imaging, such as achieving clearer de novo protein structure reconstructions. Introducing this method to the field of biology is particularly significant, as it is refining the approach to studying biological images. However, many biologists have yet to fully appreciate the distinctive meaning of neural fields in transforming 2D images into 3D perspectives. This article discusses the application of neural fields in both microscopic and macroscopic biological images and their practical uses in biomedicine, highlighting the broad prospects of neural fields in the future biological metaverse. We stand at the threshold of an exciting new era, where the advancements in neural field technology herald the dawn of exploring the mysteries of life in innovative ways.","667":"Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the world has raced to understand and accurately diagnose infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. Today, hundreds of commercial antibody tests are on the market despite often lacking proper validation and with unsatisfactory sensitivity and\/or specificity. In addition, many questions related to the humoral response remain unresolved, although research is carried out at an unprecedented speed. Despite the shortcomings, serological assays have an important part to play in combating the pandemic by aiding in diagnosis and sero-epidemiological studies. However, careful attention must be paid to the application of serology and the interpretation of serological data-especially in low prevalence regions, both at an individual and at a population level. In this article, we argue that serological results are often misinterpreted, and in the eagerness to be first, methodological rigor is often taking a backseat.","668":"This study reveals for the first time Q fever dynamics of transmission and the role of domestic livestock in transmission in French Guiana and highlights the urgent need to reinforce Q fever surveillance in livestocks of the entire Guianese territory.Q fever is a zoonosis caused by Coxiella burnetii which is among the major agents of community-acquired pneumonia in French Guiana. Despite its relatively high incidence, its epidemiology in French Guiana remains unclear, and all previous studies have considered transmission from livestock unlikely, suggesting that a wild reservoir is responsible for transmission.A country-wide seroprevalence survey of 2697 participants from French Guiana was conducted. Serum samples were tested for phase II IgG antibodies by ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFAs). Factors associated with Q fever were investigated, and a serocatalytic model was used to reconstruct the annual force of infection.The overall weighted seroprevalence was estimated at 9.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 8.2%-11.0%). The model revealed constant, low-level circulation across French Guiana, particularly affecting middle-aged males (odds ratio (OR): 3.0, 95% credible interval (CrI): 1.7-5.8) and individuals living close to sheep farms (OR: 4, 95% CrI: 1.5-12). The overall annual number of cases was estimated at 579 (95% CrI: 492-670). In the region around Cayenne, the main urban municipality, the high seroprevalence was explained by an outbreak that may have occurred between 1996 and 2003 and that infected 10% (95% CrI: 6.9%-14%) of the population and males and females alike.This study was supported by the \"European Regional Development Fund\" under EPI-ARBO grant agreement (GY0008695), the \"Regional Health Agency of French Guiana\" and the \"National Center of Spatial Studies\". The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.","669":"The first case of COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) was reported by Nigeria on February 27, 2020. Whereas case counts in the entire region remain considerably less than those being reported by individual countries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, variation in preparedness and response capacity as well as in data availability has raised concerns about undetected transmission events in the SSA region. To capture epidemiological details related to early transmission events into and within countries, a line list was developed from publicly available data on institutional websites, situation reports, press releases, and social media accounts. The availability of indicators-gender, age, travel history, date of arrival in country, reporting date of confirmation, and how detected-for each imported case was assessed. We evaluated the relationship between the time to first reported importation and the Global Health Security Index (GHSI) overall score; 13,201 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported by 48 countries in SSA during the 54 days following the first known introduction to the region. Of the 2,516 cases for which travel history information was publicly available, 1,129 (44.9%) were considered importation events. Imported cases tended to be male (65.0%), with a median age of 41.0 years (range: 6 weeks-88 years; IQR: 31-54 years). A country's time to report its first importation was not related to the GHSI overall score, after controlling for air traffic. Countries in SSA generally reported with less publicly available detail over time and tended to have greater information on imported than local cases.","670":"The immune system acts as an intricate apparatus that is dedicated to mounting a defense and ensures host survival from microbial threats. To engage this faceted immune response and provide protection against infectious diseases, vaccinations are a critical tool to be developed. However, vaccine responses are governed by levels that, when interrogated, separately only explain a fraction of the immune reaction. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a feasibility study to determine if multi-view modeling could aid in gaining actionable insights on response markers shared across populations, capture the immune system's diversity, and disentangle confounders. We thus sought to assess this multi-view modeling capacity on the responsiveness to the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination. Seroconversion to vaccine-induced antibodies against the HBV surface antigen (anti-HBs) in early converters (n = 21; <2 months) and late converters (n = 9; 10IU\/L). The multi-view data encompassed bulk RNA-seq, CD4+ T-cell parameters (including T-cell receptor data), flow cytometry data, and clinical metadata (including age and gender). The modeling included testing single-view and multi-view joint dimensionality reductions. Multi-view joint dimensionality reduction outperformed single-view methods in terms of the area under the curve and balanced accuracy, confirming the increase in predictive power to be gained. The interpretation of these findings showed that age, gender, inflammation-related gene sets, and pre-existing vaccine-specific T-cells could be associated with vaccination responsiveness. This multi-view dimensionality reduction approach complements clinical seroconversion and all single modalities. Importantly, this modeling could identify what features could predict HBV vaccine response. This methodology could be extended to other vaccination trials to identify the key features regulating responsiveness.","671":" attributable to SH was 14.47% (95% eCI: 14.37 - 14.54%). These fractions generally were higher in northern counties than in southern counties. Our findings indicate that cold and dry weather are moderately associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, with humidity playing a larger role than temperature.","672":"Expanding testing capabilities is integral to managing the further spread of SARS-CoV-2 and developing reopening strategies, particularly in regards to identifying and isolating asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals. Central to meeting testing demands are specimens that can be easily and reliably collected and laboratory capacity to rapidly ramp up to scale. We and others have demonstrated that high and consistent levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in saliva from COVID-19 inpatients, outpatients, and asymptomatic individuals. As saliva collection is non-invasive, extending this strategy to test pooled saliva samples from multiple individuals could thus provide a simple method to expand testing capacity. However, hesitation towards pooled sample testing arises due to the dilution of positive samples, potentially shifting weakly positive samples below the detection limit for SARS-CoV-2 and thereby decreasing the sensitivity. Here, we investigated the potential of pooling saliva samples by 5, 10, and 20 samples prior to RNA extraction and RT-qPCR detection of SARS-CoV-2. Based on samples tested, we conservatively estimated a reduction of 7.41%, 11.11%, and 14.81% sensitivity, for each of the pool sizes, respectively. Using these estimates we modeled anticipated changes in RT-qPCR cycle threshold to show the practical impact of pooling on results of SARS-CoV-2 testing. In tested populations with greater than 3% prevalence, testing samples in pools of 5 requires the least overall number of tests. Below 1% however, pools of 10 or 20 are more beneficial and likely more supportive of ongoing surveillance strategies.","673":" mitigation has come with substantial socioeconomic costs. In this paper we demonstrate how individualized policies based on disease status can reduce transmission risk while minimizing impacts on economic outcomes. We design feedback control policies informed by optimal control solutions to modulate interaction rates of individuals based on the epidemic state. We identify personalized interaction rates such that recovered\/immune individuals elevate their interactions and susceptible individuals remain at home before returning to pre-lockdown levels. As we show, feedback control policies can yield similar population-wide infection rates to total shutdown but with significantly lower economic costs and with greater robustness to uncertainty compared to optimal control policies. Our analysis shows that test-driven improvements in isolation efficiency of infectious individuals can inform disease-dependent interaction policies that mitigate transmission while enhancing the return of individuals to pre-pandemic economic activity.","674":"Orbital space enables many essential services, such as weather forecasting, global communication, navigation, Earth observation for environmental and agricultural management, and national security applications. Orbit use is increasingly defined by firms launching coordinated fleets-\"constellations\"-of satellites into low-Earth orbit. These firms operate in markets with few or no competitors, such as the market for broadband internet provision to rural areas. How will oligopolistic competition shape the allocation of orbital space? We analyze orbital-use patterns and economic welfare when two profit-maximizing firms operate satellite constellations with sophisticated collision avoidance systems. We compare this duopoly equilibrium to public utility constellations designed and regulated to maximize economic welfare from orbit use. We show that imperfect competition reduces economic welfare from orbit use by up to 12%-$1.1 billion USD-per year and distorts the allocation of orbital space. The nature of the distortion depends on the magnitude of constellation-related environmental damages. When damages are low, economic welfare is maximized by larger-than-equilibrium constellations. When damages are high, economic welfare is maximized by smaller-than-equilibrium constellations. Between the growing commercial and national interests in outer space and the importance of low-Earth orbit to space exploration, orbit-use management is likely to be a fruitful and policy-relevant area for economic research. We conclude with a discussion of future research directions in orbit-use management relevant to policymakers around the world.","675":"The presence of antibodies to Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) can be detected in blood donations. Donation-based surveillance provides an alternative strategy to estimate population prevalence by detecting antibodies that are circulating. To estimate population prevalence, we conducted a systematic review of literature on the seroprevalence of ZIKV and DENV antibodies in blood donations. We searched PubMed and Web of Science for studies that reported the seroprevalence of ZIKV and DENV in blood donations. The title and abstract of each study were screened by 2 reviewers simultaneously for possible inclusion, and the full text of selected studies was reviewed to ensure that they met inclusion criteria (used primary data collection, reported evidence of immunoglobulin M (IgM) or immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in the blood supply, and included a representative sample of the total population). Immunoglobin test measuring levels of antibodies to IgM and IgG and number of positive cases were extracted from each study. No exclusions were made based on language or country. Our initial search identified 1890 studies after excluding duplicates, of which 76 were assessed for full text eligibility to ensure that they met our final inclusion criteria. There were 14 studies included in our review; 11 examined the seroprevalence of DENV, and 3 examined ZIKV. The highest seroprevalence by IgM was 2.82% for DENV and 0.53% for ZIKV. Our results indicate that the seroprevalence of ZIKV and DENV antibody presence in countries with active transmission is higher than reports by traditional surveillance in some countries. This finding is expected due to the large percentage of asymptomatic cases. The highest seroprevalence was observed for IgG, which can persist over long periods of time compared to IgM. Screening of blood donations may help supplement traditional surveillance measures, especially during outbreak settings.","676":"Mendelian randomization (MR) has become a common tool used in epidemiological studies. However, when confounding variables are correlated with the instrumental variable (in this case, a genetic\/variant\/marker), the estimation can remain biased even with MR. We propose conditioning on parental mating types (a function of parental genotypes) in MR to eliminate the need for one set of assumptions, thereby plausibly reducing such bias. We illustrate a situation in which the instrumental variable and confounding variables are correlated using two unlinked diallelic genetic loci: one, an instrumental variable and the other, a confounding variable. Assortative mating or population admixture can create an association between the two unlinked loci, which can violate one of the necessary assumptions for MR. We simulated datasets involving assortative mating and population admixture and analyzed them using three different methods: 1) conventional MR, 2) MR conditioning on parental genotypes, and 3) MR conditioning on parental mating types. We demonstrated that conventional MR leads to type I error rate inflation and biased estimates for cases with assortative mating or population admixtures. In the presence of non-additive effects, MR with an adjustment for parental genotypes only partially reduced the type I error rate inflation and bias. In contrast, conditioning on parental mating types in MR eliminated the type I error inflation and bias under these circumstances. Conditioning on parental mating types is a useful strategy to reduce the burden of assumptions and the potential bias in MR when the correlation between the instrument variable and confounders is due to assortative mating or population stratification but not linkage.","677":" The use of PMC vaccines to replace MenAfriVac in routine infant immunization and in district-specific reactive campaigns would have important health benefits and is likely to be cost-effective in Niger. An additional PMC catch-up campaign would also be cost-effective if we account for incomplete laboratory reporting.","678":"Of the ~\u200940,000 adults in diabetes care, only ~\u200925% achieved sustained glucose control. Monitoring costs were higher for those who did not: by 10% for patients receiving non-pharmacological treatment, by 61% for insulin patients, and twice as high for patients prescribed oral treatment. Initiatives to improve treatment adherence (e.g. medication copayment schemes, enhanced adherence counseling) would address barriers along the care continuum and we estimate such expenditures may be recouped by reductions in patient monitoring costs. Improvements in case detection are also needed, with only around two-thirds of estimated cases having been diagnosed. Outreach screening campaigns could play a significant role: depending on how well-targeted and scalable such campaigns are, we estimate that 10-46% of all screening could be conducted via outreach, at a cost per positive patient identified of US$7.12-9.63.Diabetes is one of the leading causes of poor health and high care costs in Ukraine. To prevent diabetes complications and alleviate the financial burden of diabetes care on patients, the Ukrainian government reimburses diabetes medication and provides glucose monitoring, but there are significant gaps in the care continuum. We estimate the costs of providing diabetes care and the most cost-effective ways to address these gaps in the Poltava region of Ukraine.Investments to improve case detection and treatment adherence are the most efficient interventions for improved diabetes control in Poltava. Quantitative tools provide essential decision support for targeting investment to close the gaps in care.We gathered data on the unit costs of diabetes interventions in Poltava and estimated expenditure on diabetes care. We estimated the optimal combination of facility-based and outreach screening and investigated how additional funding could best be allocated to improve glucose control outcomes.","679":"Biofilms are surface-attached microbial communities whose architecture can be captured with confocal microscopy. Manual or automatic thresholding of acquired images is often needed to help distinguish biofilm biomass from background noise. However, manual thresholding is subjective and current automatic thresholding methods can lead to loss of meaningful data. Here, we describe an automatic thresholding method designed for confocal fluorescent signal, termed the biovolume elasticity method (BEM). We evaluated BEM using confocal image stacks of oral biofilms grown in pooled human saliva. Image stacks were thresholded manually and automatically with three different methods; Otsu, iterative selection (IS), and BEM. Effects on biovolume, surface area, and number of objects detected indicated that the BEM was the least aggressive at removing signal, and provided the greatest visual and quantitative acuity of single cells. Thus, thresholding with BEM offers a sensitive, automatic, and tunable method to maintain biofilm architectural properties for subsequent analysis.","680":"Despite focusing on cholera burden, epidemiologic studies in Bangladesh tend to be limited in geographic scope. National-level cholera surveillance data can help inform cholera control strategies and assess the effectiveness of preventive measures. Hospital-based sentinel surveillance among patients with suspected diarrhea in different sites across Bangladesh has been conducted since 2014. We selected an age-stratified sample of 20 suspected cholera cases each week from each sentinel site, tested stool for the presence of Vibrio cholerae O1\/O139 by culture, and characterized antibiotic susceptibility in a subset of culture-positive isolates. We estimated the odds of being culture positive among suspected cholera cases according to different potential risk factors. From May 4, 2014 through November 30, 2021, we enrolled 51,414 suspected cases from our sentinel surveillance sites. We confirmed V. cholerae O1 in 5.2% of suspected cases through microbiological culture. The highest proportion of confirmed cholera cases was from Chittagong (9.7%) and the lowest was from Rangpur Division (0.9%). Age, number of purges, duration of diarrhea, occupation, and season were the most relevant factors in distinguishing cholera-positive suspected cases from cholera-negative suspected cases. Nationwide surveillance data show that cholera is circulating in Bangladesh and the southern region is more affected than the northern region. Antimicrobial resistance patterns indicate that multidrug resistance (resistance to three or more classes of antibiotics) of V. cholerae O1 could be a major threat in the future. Alignment of these results with Bangladesh's cholera-control program will be the foundation for future research into the efficacy of cholera-control initiatives.","681":"The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 caused major disruptions of societal functions, including health care. Patients receiving medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) depend on receiving daily treatment and face a risk of withdrawal in case of medication supply disruption. MOUD are banned in Russia, making treatment continuation impossible in temporarily occupied areas. In this paper, we review the situation with MOUD delivery in Ukraine during the first year of the Russia-Ukraine war. Legislative changes and\u00a0mobilization of efforts in the time\u00a0of crisis ensured treatment continuation for thousands of patients.\u00a0In areas controlled by Ukraine, most patients were receiving take-home doses for up to 30 days, some experienced temporary dosing reductions. Programs in temporarily occupied regions were shut down likely leading to abrupt withdrawal among many patients. At least 10% of patients have been internally displaced. One year into the war, the number of MOUD patients in governmental clinics of Ukraine increased by 17%, and the data suggest that the coverage of private clinics has also increased. But the risks for program stability remain high as the current medication supply relies on one manufacturing facility. Using lessons learned from the crisis, we provide recommendations for future response to minimize the risks of major adverse outcomes among patients treated for opioid use disorder.","682":null,"683":"The Planetary Child Health and Enterics Observatory (Plan-EO) is a new initiative that builds on existing partnerships between epidemiologists, climatologists, bioinformaticians, and hydrologists as well as investigators in numerous low- and middle-income countries. Its objective is to provide the research and stakeholder community with an evidence base for the geographical targeting of enteropathogen-specific child health interventions such as novel vaccines. The initiative will produce, curate, and disseminate spatial data products relating to the distribution of enteric pathogens and their environmental and sociodemographic determinants.Diarrhea remains a leading cause of childhood illness throughout the world and is caused by various species of ecologically sensitive pathogens. The emerging Planetary Health movement emphasizes the interdependence of human health with natural systems, and much of its focus has been on infectious diseases and their interactions with environmental and human processes. Meanwhile, the era of big data has engendered a public appetite for interactive web-based dashboards for infectious diseases. However, enteric infectious diseases have been largely overlooked by these developments.As climate change accelerates there is an urgent need for etiology-specific estimates of diarrheal disease burden at high spatiotemporal resolution. Plan-EO aims to address key challenges and knowledge gaps by making rigorously obtained, generalizable disease burden estimates freely available and accessible to the research and stakeholder communities. Pre-processed environmental and EO-derived spatial data products will be housed, continually updated, and made publicly available to the research and stakeholder communities both within the webpage itself and for download. These inputs can then be used to identify and target priority populations living in transmission hotspots and for decision-making, scenario-planning, and disease burden projection.PROSPERO protocol #CRD42023384709.","684":"Controlled human challenge trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates could accelerate the testing and potential rollout of efficacious vaccines. By replacing conventional Phase 3 testing of vaccine candidates, such trials may subtract many months from the licensure process, making efficacious vaccines available more quickly. Obviously, challenging volunteers with this live virus risks inducing severe disease and possibly even death. However, we argue that such studies, by accelerating vaccine evaluation, could reduce the global burden of coronavirus-related mortality and morbidity. Volunteers in such studies could autonomously authorize the risks to themselves, and their net risk could be acceptable if participants comprise healthy young adults, who are at relatively low risk of serious disease following natural infection, they have a high baseline risk of natural infection, and during the trial they receive frequent monitoring and, following any infection, the best available care.","685":"The true number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States was inferred from data on reported deaths using age-specific infection-fatality rates (IFRs). Taking into account the estimates for vaccine effectiveness and protection against reinfection, the overall population immunity was determined as the sum of protection levels in vaccinated persons and those who were previously infected but not vaccinated.As of 15 July 2021, the U.S. population immunity against COVID-19 may still have been insufficient to contain the outbreaks and safely revert to prepandemic social behavior.As of 28 July 2021, 60% of adults in the United States had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and more than 34 million cases had been reported.

The mean overall population immunity was 62.0% (CrI, 58.4% to 66.4%). Adults aged 65 years or older were estimated to have the highest immunity level (77.2% [CrI, 76.2% to 78.6%]), and children younger than 12 years had the lowest immunity level (17.9% [CrI, 14.4% to 21.9%]).","686":"Epidemiological models are commonly fit to case and pathogen sequence data to estimate parameters and to infer unobserved disease dynamics. Here, we present an inference approach based on sequence data that is well suited for model fitting early on during the expansion of a viral lineage. Our approach relies on a trajectory of segregating sites to infer epidemiological parameters within a Sequential Monte Carlo framework. Using simulated data, we first show that our approach accurately recovers key epidemiological quantities under a single-introduction scenario. We then apply our approach to SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from France, estimating a basic reproduction number of approximately 2.3-2.7 under an epidemiological model that allows for multiple introductions. Our approach presented here indicates that inference approaches that rely on simple population genetic summary statistics can be informative of epidemiological parameters and can be used for reconstructing infectious disease dynamics during the early expansion of a viral lineage.","687":"Hepatitis E virus, typically genotypes 1 and 2, is a major cause of avoidable morbidity and mortality in South Asia. Although case fatality risk among pregnant women can reach as high as 25%, a lack of population-level disease burden data has been cited as a primary factor in key global policy recommendations against the routine use of licensed hepatitis E vaccines, one of the only effective tools available for preventing disease and death.We tested serum samples from 2924 individuals from 70 communities representing all divisions of Bangladesh and estimated a national seroprevalence of hepatitis E of 20% (95% CI 17-24%). Seropositivity increased with age and male sex (Odds Ratio: 2.2 male vs. female, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.8-2.8). Community-level seroprevalence ranged from 0-78% with the seroprevalence in urban areas being higher, including Dhaka, the capital, with 3.0-fold (95% Credible Interval 2.3-3.7) higher seroprevalence than the rest of the country.We tested serum from a nationally-representative serosurvey in Bangladesh for anti-HEV IgG. We estimated the proportion of the population with evidence of historical HEV infection and used Bayesian geostatistical models to generate high-resolution national maps of seropositivity. We examined variability in seropositivity by individual-level, household-level, and community-level risk factors using spatial logistic regression.Hepatitis E infections are common throughout Bangladesh. Strengthening clinical surveillance for hepatitis E, especially in urban areas may help generate additional evidence needed to appropriately target interventions like vaccines to the populations most likely to benefit.","688":"The study showed that the district had good coverage of vector control tools against malaria but sub-optimal living conditions and poor access to basic services.

Study aims were as follows: (1) quantify user engagement of posts (\"tweets\") about T2 by NYC organizations on Twitter and (2) examine the emotional tone of social media users' T2-related tweets in our sample of 1987 T2-related tweets. Celebrities and CBOs generated more user engagement (0.26% and 0.07%, respectively) compared to government agencies (e.g., Mayor's Office, 0.0019%), reinforcing the value of collaborating with celebrities and CBOs in social media public health campaigns. Sentiment analysis revealed that positive tweets (46.5%) had higher user engagement than negative tweets (number of likes: R2\u2009=\u2009.095, p\u2009<\u2009.01), underscoring the importance of positively framing messages for effective public health campaigns.","691":"This study aimed to assess the usability and feasibility of The Tick App, the first tick research-focused app in the United States.This assessment allowed us to identify what fraction of the population used The Tick App and how it was used during a pilot phase. This information will be used to improve future iterations of The Tick App and tailor potential tick prevention interventions to the users' characteristics.The Tick App was designed as a survey tool to collect data on human behaviors and movements associated with tick exposure while engaging users in tick identification and reporting. It consists of an enrollment survey to identify general risk factors, daily surveys to collect data on human activities and tick encounters (Tick Diaries), a survey to enter the details of tick encounters coupled with tick identification services provided by the research team (Report a Tick), and educational material. Using quantitative and qualitative methods, we evaluated the enrollment strategy (passive vs active), the user profile, location, longitudinal use of its features, and users' feedback.Mobile health (mHealth) technology takes advantage of smartphone features to turn them into research tools, with the potential to reach a larger section of the population in a cost-effective manner, compared with traditional epidemiological methods. Although mHealth apps have been widely implemented in chronic diseases and psychology, their potential use in the research of vector-borne diseases has not yet been fully exploited.Between May and September 2018, 1468 adult users enrolled in the app. The Tick App users were equally represented across genders and evenly distributed across age groups. Most users owned a pet (65.94%, 962\/1459; P<.001), did frequent outdoor activities (recreational or peridomestic; 75.24%, 1094\/1454; P<.001 and 64.58%, 941\/1457; P<.001, respectively), and lived in the Midwest (56.55%, 824\/1457) and Northeast (33.0%, 481\/1457) regions in the United States, more specifically in Wisconsin, southern New York, and New Jersey.

A theoretical framework attributing the origin and sustainment of these fields to the so-called fluctuation dynamo was recently validated by experiments on laser facilities in low-magnetic-Prandtl-number plasmas ([Formula: see text]). However, the same framework proposes that the fluctuation dynamo should operate differently when [Formula: see text], the regime relevant to many astrophysical environments such as the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters. This paper reports an experiment that creates a laboratory [Formula: see text] plasma dynamo. We provide a time-resolved characterization of the plasma's evolution, measuring temperatures, densities, flow velocities, and magnetic fields, which allows us to explore various stages of the fluctuation dynamo's operation on seed magnetic fields generated by the action of the Biermann-battery mechanism during the initial drive-laser target interaction. The magnetic energy in structures with characteristic scales close to the driving scale of the stochastic motions is found to increase by almost three orders of magnitude and saturate dynamically. It is shown that the initial growth of these fields occurs at a much greater rate than the turnover rate of the driving-scale stochastic motions. Our results point to the possibility that plasma turbulence produced by strong shear can generate fields more efficiently at the driving scale than anticipated by idealized magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of the nonhelical fluctuation dynamo; this finding could help explain the large-scale fields inferred from observations of astrophysical systems.","693":". We collected information on the demography, clinical presentation, hospitalization, contact network and presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasopharyngeal swabs for 85.9% and 71.5% of the population of Vo' at two consecutive time points. On the first survey, which was conducted around the time the town lockdown started, we found a prevalence of infection of 2.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-3.3%). On the second survey, which was conducted at the end of the lockdown, we found a prevalence of 1.2% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.8-1.8%). Notably, 42.5% (95% CI 31.5-54.6%) of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections detected across the two surveys were asymptomatic (i.e. did not have symptoms at the time of swab testing and did not develop symptoms afterwards). The mean serial interval was 7.2 days (95% CI 5.9-9.6). We found no statistically significant difference in the viral load of symptomatic versus asymptomatic infections (p-values 0.62 and 0.74 for E and RdRp genes, respectively, Exact Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test). This study sheds new light on the frequency of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, their infectivity (as measured by the viral load) and provides new insights into its transmission dynamics and the efficacy of the implemented control measures.","694":"We searched three databases for modelling studies that assessed the impact of an outbreak response. We extracted data on author affiliation type (academic institution, governmental, and non-governmental organizations), location studied, and whether at least one author was affiliated to the studied location. We also extracted the outcomes and interventions studied, and model characteristics. Included studies were grouped into two collaboration types: purely academic (papers with only academic affiliations), and mixed (all other combinations) to help investigate differences in modelling patterns between collaboration types in the human disease literature and overall differences with FMD collaboration practices.Human VPDs formed 227 of 252 included studies. Purely academic collaborations dominated the human disease studies (56%). Notably, mixed collaborations increased in the last seven years (2013-2019). Most studies had an author affiliated to an institution in the country studied (75.2%) but this was more likely among the mixed collaborations. Contrasted to the human VPDs, mixed collaborations dominated the FMD literature (56%). Furthermore, FMD studies more often had an author with an affiliation to the country studied (92%) and used complex model design, including stochasticity, and model parametrization and validation.The increase in mixed collaboration studies over the past seven years could suggest an increase in the uptake of modelling for outbreak response decision-making. We encourage more mixed collaborations between academic and non-academic institutions and the involvement of locally affiliated authors to help ensure that the studies suit local contexts.Outbreak response modelling often involves collaboration among academics, and experts from governmental and non-governmental organizations. We conducted a systematic review of modelling studies on human vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) outbreaks to identify patterns in modelling practices between two collaboration types. We complemented this with a mini comparison of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), a veterinary disease that is controllable by vaccination.","695":"The degree to which individual heterogeneity in the production of secondary cases (\"superspreading\") affects tuberculosis (TB) transmission has not been systematically studied. We searched for population-based or surveillance studies in which whole genome sequencing was used to estimate TB transmission and the size distributions of putative TB transmission clusters were enumerated. We fit cluster size distribution data to a negative binomial branching process model to jointly infer the transmission parameters $R$ (the reproductive number) and dispersion parameter, $k$, which quantifies the propensity of superspreading in a population (generally, lower values of $k$ ($<1.0$) suggest increased heterogeneity). Of 4,796 citations identified in our initial search, nine studies met inclusion criteria ($n=5$ all TB; $n=4$ drug resistant TB) from eight global settings. Estimated $R$ values (range: 0.10, 0.73) were below 1.0, consistent with declining epidemics in the included settings; estimated $k$ values were well below 1.0 (range: 0.02, 0.48), indicating the presence of substantial individual-level heterogeneity in transmission across all settings. We estimated that a minority of cases (range 2-31%) drive the majority (80%) of ongoing transmission at the population level. Identifying sources of heterogeneity and accounting for them in TB control may have a considerable impact on mitigating TB transmission.","696":"Staphylococcus aureus is a multi-host pathogen that causes infections in animals and humans globally. The specific genetic loci-and the extent to which they drive cross-species switching, transmissibility, and adaptation-are not well understood. Here, we conducted a population genomic study of 437 S. aureus isolates to identify bacterial genetic variation that determines infection of human and animal hosts through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using linear mixed models. We found genetic variants tagging \u03c6Sa3 prophage-encoded immune evasion genes associated with human hosts, which contributed ~99.9% of the overall heritability (~88%), highlighting their key role in S. aureus human infection. Furthermore, GWAS of pairs of phylogenetically matched human and animal isolates confirmed and uncovered additional loci not implicated in GWAS of unmatched isolates. Our findings reveal the loci that are critical for S. aureus host transmissibility, infection, switching, and adaptation and how their spread alters the specificity of host-adapted clones.","697":"The purpose of this study was to present our evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of salvage therapies for patients with recurrent head and neck cancer.None of the treatment strategies were cost-effective. However, SBRT-based reirradiation has potential to be cost-effective.In the base case analysis, no treatment strategy was cost-effective at a WTP threshold. The most cost-effective therapy was SBRT alone with $150\u00a0866 per QALY gained. If median survival of SBRT alone was \u226511 months, SBRT was considered to be cost-effective.A Markov model was developed with 5 salvage treatment strategies: (1) platinum-based chemotherapy alone; (2) chemotherapy plus cetuximab; (3) stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) alone; (4) SBRT plus cetuximab; and (5) intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plus chemotherapy. Clinical parameters were obtained from comprehensive literature review and 2016 Medicare reimbursement. Strategies were compared using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), with effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and evaluated with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100\u00a0000 per QALY gained.","698":"Immunosuppression after measles is known to predispose people to opportunistic infections for a period of several weeks to months. Using population-level data, we show that measles has a more prolonged effect on host resistance, extending over 2 to 3 years. We find that nonmeasles infectious disease mortality in high-income countries is tightly coupled to measles incidence at this lag, in both the pre- and post-vaccine eras. We conclude that long-term immunologic sequelae of measles drive interannual fluctuations in nonmeasles deaths. This is consistent with recent experimental work that attributes the immunosuppressive effects of measles to depletion of B and T lymphocytes. Our data provide an explanation for the long-term benefits of measles vaccination in preventing all-cause infectious disease. By preventing measles-associated immune memory loss, vaccination protects polymicrobial herd immunity. ","699":"This study demonstrates the benefits of increased statistical power from matched controls in malaria surveillance studies, which allows identification of additional independent risk factors. It also illustrates an example of research partnership between academia and government to collect high quality data relevant to planning malaria elimination activities. Modifiable risk factors and implications of the findings for malaria elimination strategy are presented.To better understand risk factors for malaria transmission in central Viet Nam, a survey of 1000 malaria positive cases and 1000 malaria negative controls was conducted. Cases and controls were matched for age and gender and self-presented at commune health stations (CHS) in Binh Phuoc, Dak Nong and Dak Lak Provinces. Diagnoses were confirmed with microscopy, rapid diagnostic test and PCR. Participants were interviewed about 50 potential risk factors for malaria, which included information about occupation, forest visitation, travel, healthcare-seeking behaviour and prior use of anti-malaria interventions. Participants were enrolled by trained government health workers and the samples were analysed in Vietnamese government laboratories. Data were analysed by univariable, block-wise and multivariable logistic regression.A key step to advancing the goal of malaria elimination in Viet Nam by 2030 is focusing limited resources for treatment and prevention to groups most at risk for malaria transmission.Among cases, 61.8% had Plasmodium falciparum, 35.2% Plasmodium vivax and 3% mixed species infections. Median (IQR) age was 27 (21-36) years and 91.2% were male. Twenty-five risk factors were associated with being a case and eleven with being a control. Multivariable analysis found that malaria cases correlated with forest workers, recent forest visitation, longer duration of illness, having a recorded fever, number of malaria infections in the past year, having had prior malaria treatment and having previously visited a clinic.","700":", a newly constructed viral family, is significantly depleted in CRC subjects. Our interkingdom association analysis reveals a less intertwined correlation between the gut virome and bacteriome in CRC compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we show that the viral abundance profiles can be used to accurately predict CRC disease status (AUROC >0.8) in both within-study and cross-study settings. The combination of training sets resulted in rather generalized and accurate prediction models. Our study clearly shows that subjects with colorectal cancer harbor a distinct human gut virome profile which may have an important role in this disease.","701":"In this paper, we describe a population of mothers who are opioid dependent at the time of giving birth and neonates exposed to opioids in utero who experience withdrawal following birth. While there have been studies of national trends in this population, there remains a gap in studies of regional trends. Using data from the Arizona Department of Health Services Hospital Discharge Database, this study aimed to characterize the population of neonates with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) and mothers who were opioid dependent at the time of giving birth, in Arizona. We analyzed approximately 1.2 million electronic medical records from the Arizona Department of Health Services Hospital Discharge Database to identify patterns and disparities across socioeconomic, ethnic, racial, and\/or geographic groupings. In addition, we identified comorbid conditions that are differentially associated with NOWS in neonates or opioid dependence in mothers. Our analysis was designed to assess whether indicators such as race\/ethnicity, insurance payer, marital status, and comorbidities are related to the use of opioids while pregnant. Our findings suggest that women and neonates who are non-Hispanic White and economically disadvantaged, tend be part of our populations of interest more frequently than expected. Additionally, women who are opioid dependent at the time of giving birth are unmarried more often than expected, and we suggest that marital status could be a proxy for support. Finally, we identified comorbidities associated with neonates who have NOWS and mothers who are opioid dependent not previously reported.","702":"Although the COVID-19 pandemic has persisted for over 2 years, reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 are not well understood. We use the electronic health record (EHR)-based study cohort from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) as part of the NIH Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative to characterize reinfection, understand development of Long COVID after reinfection, and compare severity of reinfection with initial infection. We validate previous findings of reinfection incidence (5.9%), the occurrence of most reinfections during the Omicron epoch, and evidence of multiple reinfections. We present novel findings that Long COVID diagnoses occur closer to the index date for infection or reinfection in the Omicron BA epoch. We report lower albumin levels leading up to reinfection and a statistically significant association of severity between first infection and reinfection (chi-squared value: 9446.2, p-value: 0) with a medium effect size (Cramer's V: 0.18, DoF = 4).","703":"We used a stochastic agent-based immune simulation platform to simulate two-dose and three-dose vaccination protocols with an adenoviral vaccine. We identified the model's parameters fitting anti-Spike antibody levels from individuals immunized with the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1-S, Vaxzevria). We used several statistical methods, such as principal component analysis and binary classification, to analyze the correlation between pre-existing levels of antibodies, plasma cells, and memory B and T cells to the magnitude of the antibody response following a booster dose.We find that the magnitude of the antibody response to a booster depends on the number of pre-existing memory B cells, which, in turn, is highly correlated to the number of T helper cells and plasma cells, and the antibody titers. Pre-existing memory T cytotoxic cells and antibodies directly influence antigen availability hence limiting the magnitude of the immune response. The optimal immunogenicity of the third dose is achieved over a large time window, spanning from 6 to 16 months after the second dose. Interestingly, after any vaccine dose, individuals can be classified into two groups, sustainers and decayers, that differ in the kinetics of decline of their antibody titers due to differences in long-lived plasma cells. This suggests that the decayers may benefit from a tailored boosting schedule with a shorter interval to avoid the temporary loss of serological immunity.We aim to explore in-silico the effect of the interval between vaccine administrations on immunogenicity and to analyze the contribution of pre-existing levels of antibodies, plasma cells, and memory B and T lymphocytes.The immune response to adenoviral COVID-19 vaccines is affected by the interval between doses. The optimal interval is unknown.","704":".

By using the method of least squares and the best fit curve, we estimate the model parameters to calibrate the model with daily new confirmed cases and cumulative confirmed cases in India for the period from May 1, 2020 to June 25, 2020. Our result shows that the implementation of an almost perfect isolation in India and 33.33% increment in contact-tracing on June 26, 2020 may reduce the number of cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in India by around 53.8% at the end of July 2020. Nationwide lockdown with high efficiency can diminish COVID-19 cases drastically, but combined NPIs may accomplish the strongest and most rapid impact on the spreading of COVID-19 in India.","707":"The oil contents and fatty acid composition of three non-edible seed oils extracted using Soxhlet extraction with hexane as the solvent were presented. The physical and chemical properties of the oils were determined from which cetane number, biofuel potential, higher heating values, and antimicrobial activities were assessed. The dominant fatty acids were 49 % linoleic acid, 37 % pentadecenoic acid, and 38 % cis-10-heptadecenenoic acid for Hura crepitans (HC), Thevetia nerifolia (TN) and Trichosanthes cucumerina (TC), respectively. The seed oils were majorly unsaturated, with HC having the highest degree of unsaturation. Acid value, saponification value, iodine value, and free fatty acids were low compared to many reported values in literature. The cetane values were generally high because the oils have a reasonable amount of saturated fatty acid, with TN having the highest cetane number. The low iodine value and saponification value make the biofuel potential and higher heating value to be high with TN having the highest in both and thus the best seed oil for biofuel. However, TN and HC have no antimicrobial activity to Klebsiella pneumoniae (gram -ve), Staphylococcus aureus (gram +ve), Escherichia coli (gram -ve), Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Candida albican, Rhizopus stolonifer, Fusarium Solani, Aspergillus flavus and Candida tropicalis, while TC has broad spectrum of activity against all tested bacteria and fungi, except Klebsiella pneumoniae.","708":"A zoonotic coronavirus, labeled as 2019-nCoV by The World Health Organization (WHO), has been identified as the causative agent of the viral pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019. Although 2019-nCoV can cause a severe respiratory illness like SARS and MERS, evidence from clinics suggested that 2019-nCoV is generally less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, and much less than MERS-CoV. The transmissibility of 2019-nCoV is still debated and needs to be further assessed. To avoid the 2019-nCoV outbreak turning into an epidemic or even a pandemic and to minimize the mortality rate, China activated emergency response procedures, but much remains to be learned about the features of the virus to refine the risk assessment and response. Here, the current knowledge in 2019-nCoV pathogenicity and transmissibility is summarized in comparison with several commonly known emerging viruses, and information urgently needed for a better control of the disease is highlighted.","709":"Good Samaritan Laws are a harm reduction policy intended to facilitate a reduction in fatal opioid overdoses by enabling bystanders, first responders, and health care providers to assist individuals experiencing an overdose without facing civil or criminal liability. However, Good Samaritan Laws may not be reaching their full impact in many communities due to a lack of knowledge of protections under these laws, distrust in law enforcement, and fear of legal consequences among potential bystanders. The purpose of this study was to develop a systems-level understanding of the factors influencing bystander responses to opioid overdose in the context of Connecticut's Good Samaritan Laws and identify high-leverage policies for improving opioid-related outcomes and implementation of these laws in Connecticut (CT).Our qualitative SD model brings a nuanced systems perspective to the literature on bystander behavior in the context of Good Samaritan Laws. Our model, grounded in local knowledge and experience, shows how the hypothesized non-linear interdependencies of the social, structural, and policy determinants of bystander behavior collectively form endogenous feedback loops that can be leveraged to design policies to advance and sustain systems change.Our resulting qualitative SD model captures our GMB participants' collective understanding of the dynamics driving bystander behavior and other factors influencing the effectiveness of Good Samaritan Laws in the state of CT. In this model, we identified seven balancing (B) and eight reinforcing (R) feedback loops within four narrative domains: Narrative 1 - Overdose, Calling 911, and First Responder Burnout; Narrative 2 - Naloxone Use, Acceptability, and Linking Patients to Services; Narrative 3 - Drug Arrests, Belief in Good Samaritan Laws, and Community Trust in Police; and Narrative 4 - Bystander Naloxone Use, Community Participation in Harm Reduction, and Cultural Change Towards Carrying Naloxone.We conducted six group model building (GMB) workshops that engaged a diverse set of participants with medical and community expertise and lived bystander experience. Through an iterative, stakeholder-engaged process, we developed, refined, and validated a qualitative system dynamics (SD) model in the form of a causal loop diagram (CLD).","710":"Antibiotic-resistant infections are a growing threat to human health, but basic features of the eco-evolutionary dynamics remain unexplained. Most prominently, there is no clear mechanism for the long-term coexistence of both drug-sensitive and resistant strains at intermediate levels, a ubiquitous pattern seen in surveillance data. Here we show that accounting for structured or spatially-heterogeneous host populations and variability in antibiotic consumption can lead to persistent coexistence over a wide range of treatment coverages, drug efficacies, costs of resistance, and mixing patterns. Moreover, this mechanism can explain other puzzling spatiotemporal features of drug-resistance epidemiology that have received less attention, such as large differences in the prevalence of resistance between geographical regions with similar antibiotic consumption or that neighbor one another. We find that the same amount of antibiotic use can lead to very different levels of resistance depending on how treatment is distributed in a transmission network. We also identify parameter regimes in which population structure alone cannot support coexistence, suggesting the need for other mechanisms to explain the epidemiology of antibiotic resistance. Our analysis identifies key features of host population structure that can be used to assess resistance risk and highlights the need to include spatial or demographic heterogeneity in models to guide resistance management.","711":"The effects of antiretroviral treatment on the HIV epidemic are complex. HIV-infected individuals survive longer with treatment, but are less likely to transmit the disease. The standard coverage measure improves with the deaths of untreated individuals and does not consider the fact that some individuals may acquire the disease and die before receiving treatment, making it susceptible to overestimating the long-run performance of antiretroviral treatment programs.We introduced cumulative incidence-based coverage as an alternative to measure an HIV treatment program's success. To numerically compare the definitions, we extended a simulation model of HIV disease and treatment to represent a dynamic population that includes uninfected and HIV-infected individuals. Also, we estimated the additional resources required to implement various treatment policies in a resource-limited setting.The objective was to propose an alternative coverage definition to better measure the long-run performance of HIV treatment programs.Cumulative incidence-based definition of coverage yields a more accurate representation of the long-run treatment success and along with the WHO and other definitions of coverage provides a better understanding of the HIV treatment progress.In a synthetic population of 600,000 people of which 44,000 (7.6%) are infected, and eligible for treatment with a CD4 count of less than 500 cells\/mm(3), assuming a World Health Organization (WHO)-defined coverage rate of 50% of eligible people, and treating these individuals with a single treatment regimen, the gap between the current WHO coverage definition and our proposed one is as much as 16% over a 10-year planning horizon.","712":"South Africa was among the first countries to detect the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. However, the size of its Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 subvariants (BA.1\/2) wave remains poorly understood. We analyzed sequential serum samples collected through a prospective cohort study before, during, and after the Omicron BA.1\/2 wave to infer infection rates and monitor changes in the immune histories of participants over time. We found that the Omicron BA.1\/2 wave infected more than half of the cohort population, with reinfections and vaccine breakthroughs accounting for >\u200960% of all infections in both rural and urban sites. After the Omicron BA.1\/2 wave, we found few (<\u20096%) remained na\u00efve to SARS-CoV-2 and the population immunologic landscape is fragmented with diverse infection\/immunization histories. Prior infection with the ancestral strain, Beta, and Delta variants provided 13%, 34%, and 51% protection against Omicron BA.1\/2 infection, respectively. Hybrid immunity and repeated prior infections reduced the risks of Omicron BA.1\/2 infection by 60% and 85% respectively. Our study sheds light on a rapidly shifting landscape of population immunity in the Omicron era and provides context for anticipating the long-term circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in populations no longer na\u00efve to the virus.","713":"Microbial communities in sediments play an important role in alpine lake ecosystems. However, the microbial diversity and community composition of alpine lake sediments from the Hengduan Mountains remain largely unknown. Therefore, based on the Illumina MiSeq platform, high-throughput sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA gene was performed on 15 alpine lake sediments collected at different locations in the Hengduan Mountains. The abundance-based coverage estimate (ACE), Chao1, and Shannon indices indicated that the microbial abundance and diversity of these sediments were high. There are some differences in the composition of microbial communities among sediments. However, in general, Proteobacteria accounted for the largest proportion of all sediments (22.3%-67.6%) and was the dominant phylum. Followed by Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes. In addition, the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) interactions network had modular structures and suggested more cooperation than competition in the microbial community. Besides, we also found that temperature has a significant contribution to the sample-environment relationship. This study revealed the diversity and composition of microbial communities in alpine lake sediments from the Hengduan Mountains, and describe the correlation between microbial community structure and different environmental variables.","714":"Baumard's perspective asserts that \"opportunity is the mother of innovation,\" in contrast to the adage ascribing this role to necessity. Drawing on behavioral ecology and cognition, we propose that both extremes - affluence and scarcity - can drive innovation. We suggest that the types of innovations at these two extremes differ and that both rely on mechanisms operating on different time scales.","715":"Nonequilibrium demography impacts coalescent genealogies leaving detectable, well-studied signatures of variation. However, similar genomic footprints are also expected under models of large reproductive skew, posing a serious problem when trying to make inference. Furthermore, current approaches consider only one of the two processes at a time, neglecting any genomic signal that could arise from their simultaneous effects, preventing the possibility of jointly inferring parameters relating to both offspring distribution and population history. Here, we develop an extended Moran model with exponential population growth, and demonstrate that the underlying ancestral process converges to a time-inhomogeneous psi-coalescent. However, by applying a nonlinear change of time scale-analogous to the Kingman coalescent-we find that the ancestral process can be rescaled to its time-homogeneous analog, allowing the process to be simulated quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions for the expected site-frequency spectrum under the time-inhomogeneous psi-coalescent, and develop an approximate-likelihood framework for the joint estimation of the coalescent and growth parameters. By means of extensive simulation, we demonstrate that both can be estimated accurately from whole-genome data. In addition, not accounting for demography can lead to serious biases in the inferred coalescent model, with broad implications for genomic studies ranging from ecology to conservation biology. Finally, we use our method to analyze sequence data from Japanese sardine populations, and find evidence of high variation in individual reproductive success, but few signs of a recent demographic expansion.","716":"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been shown to coincide with, or anticipate, confirmed COVID-19 case numbers. During periods with high test positivity rates, however, case numbers may be underreported, whereas wastewater does not suffer from this limitation. Here we investigated how the dynamics of new COVID-19 infections estimated based on wastewater monitoring or confirmed cases compare to true COVID-19 incidence dynamics. We focused on the first pandemic wave in Switzerland (February to April, 2020), when test positivity ranged up to 26%. SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads were determined 2-4 times per week in three Swiss wastewater treatment plants (Lugano, Lausanne and Zurich). Wastewater and case data were combined with a shedding load distribution and an infection-to-case confirmation delay distribution, respectively, to estimate infection incidence dynamics. Finally, the estimates were compared to reference incidence dynamics determined by a validated compartmental model. Incidence dynamics estimated based on wastewater data were found to better track the timing and shape of the reference infection peak compared to estimates based on confirmed cases. In contrast, case confirmations provided a better estimate of the subsequent decline in infections. Under a regime of high-test positivity rates, WBE thus provides critical information that is complementary to clinical data to monitor the pandemic trajectory.","717":"Tuberculosis (TB) is the seventh leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Bangladesh. Although the National TB control program (NTP) of Bangladesh is implementing its nationwide TB control strategies, more specific and effective single or combination interventions are needed to control drug-susceptible (DS) and multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB. In this study, we developed a two strain TB mathematical model with amplification and fit it to the Bangladesh TB data to understand the transmission dynamics of DS and MDR TB. Sensitivity analysis was used to identify important parameters. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of varying combinations of four basic control strategies including distancing, latent case finding, case holding and active case finding, all within the optimal control framework. From our fitting, the model with different transmission rates between DS and MDR TB best captured the Bangladesh TB reported case counts. The estimated basic reproduction number for DS TB was 1.14 and for MDR TB was 0.54, with an amplification rate of 0.011 per year. The sensitivity analysis also indicated that the transmission rates for both DS and MDR TB had the largest influence on prevalence. To reduce the burden of TB (both DS and MDR), our finding suggested that a quadruple control strategy that combines distancing control, latent case finding, case holding and active case finding is the most cost-effective. Alternative strategies can be adopted to curb TB depending on availability of resources and policy makers' decisions.","718":"The frequency, density, and timing of parasitemia are all important risk factors for placental malaria. Interventions should target the prevention of all levels of parasitemia throughout pregnancy.Placental malaria is a major cause of adverse birth outcomes. However, data are limited on the relationships between longitudinal measures of parasitemia during pregnancy and placental malaria.Overall risk of placental malaria was 44.6%. None of the 34 women without parasitemia detected during pregnancy had evidence of placental malaria. Increasing proportion of interval assessments with parasitemia and higher parasite densities were independently associated with an increased risk of placental malaria. Higher gravidity and more effective IPTp were associated with a decreased risk of placental malaria. Women with parasitemia only detected before the third trimester still had an increased risk of placental malaria.Data came from 637 women enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) from Uganda. Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia was assessed using microscopy and ultrasensitive quantitative PCR at intervals of 28 days from 12 to 20 weeks gestation through delivery. Multivariate analysis was used to measure associations between characteristics of parasitemia during pregnancy and the risk of placental malaria based on histopathology.","719":"We analyzed data for 170 patients in South Korea who had laboratory-confirmed infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. A longer incubation period was associated with a reduction in the risk for death (adjusted odds ratio\/1-day increase in incubation period 0.83, 95% credibility interval 0.68-1.03).","720":"Infectious diseases can spread and turn into epidemics, taking thousands of lives within a matter of just a few days. Mathematical models can help us to gain insights into the dynamics of diseases and their control strategies. Besides ordinary differential equations (ODE), fractional differential equations (FDE) have been used, especially in the last decade to model the course of epidemics. Three major goals of this dissertation are: 1) For an epidemic model, which are the important parameters and do how these influence output measures? 2) Which transmission pathway is dominant? 3) Whether an ODE or FDE modeling approach fits better to data? We developed Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS) models of a recently discovered fungal pathogen, textit{Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans} (Bsal) transmission using a system of ordinary differential equations. Our models included two routes of pathogen transmission: direct transmission via contact between infected and susceptible individuals and environmental transmission via shed zoospores in the water. Unlike previous models, we categorized individuals into multiple stages of infection. We found the invasion probability for Bsal (i.e., the basic reproductive number, $mathcal{R}_0$) into a population of the Eastern Newt adults. We performed numerical simulations and parameter sensitivity analysis using Latin hypercube sampling with partial rank coefficient correlation. We identified the Bsal dominant transmission pathway and suggested disease control strategies. Finally, we compare the performance of systems of ordinary and (Caputo) fractional differential equations depicting Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) models of diseases. In order to understand the origins of both approaches as mean-field approximations of fractional stochastic processes, we introduced the ordinary and fractional differential equations as approximations of some type of fractional nonlinear birth-death processes. We examined the validity of the two approaches against empirical courses of epidemics. We fit both models to case counts of three measles epidemics that occurred during the pre-vaccination era in three different locations. Our results suggest that data might guide the choice of modeling framework (ODE vs. FDE). Overall, this dissertation highlights the fact that data can play an important role in multiple stages of the model process.","721":"Studies on climate variables and food pathogens are either pathogen- or region-specific, necessitating a consolidated view on the subject. This study aims to systematically review all studies on the association of ambient temperature and precipitation on the incidence of gastroenteritis and bacteraemia from Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Vibrio, and Listeria species. PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched up to 9 March 2023. We screened 3,204 articles for eligibility and included 83 studies in the review and three in the meta-analysis. Except for one study on Campylobacter, all showed a positive association between temperature and Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio sp., and Campylobacter gastroenteritis. Similarly, most of the included studies showed that precipitation was positively associated with these conditions. These positive associations were found regardless of the effect measure chosen. The pooled incidence rate ratio (IRR) for the three studies that included bacteraemia from Campylobacter and Salmonella sp. was 1.05 (95 per cent confidence interval (95% CI): 1.03, 1.06) for extreme temperature and 1.09 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.19) for extreme precipitation. If current climate trends continue, our findings suggest these pathogens would increase patient morbidity, the need for hospitalization, and prolonged antibiotic courses.","722":"Computational neuroscience is a field that traces its origins to the efforts of Hodgkin and Huxley, who pioneered quantitative analysis of electrical activity in the nervous system. While also continuing as an independent field, computational neuroscience has combined with computational systems biology, and neural multiscale modeling arose as one offshoot. This consolidation has added electrical, graphical, dynamical system, learning theory, artificial intelligence and neural network viewpoints with the microscale of cellular biology (neuronal and glial), mesoscales of vascular, immunological and neuronal networks, on up to macroscales of cognition and behavior. The complexity of linkages that produces pathophysiology in neurological, neurosurgical and psychiatric disease will require multiscale modeling to provide understanding that exceeds what is possible with statistical analysis or highly simplified models: how to bring together pharmacotherapeutics with neurostimulation, how to personalize therapies, how to combine novel therapies with neurorehabilitation, how to interlace periodic diagnostic updates with frequent reevaluation of therapy, how to understand a physical disease that manifests as a disease of the mind. Multiscale modeling will also help to extend the usefulness of animal models of human diseases in neuroscience, where the disconnects between clinical and animal phenomenology are particularly pronounced. Here we cover areas of particular interest for clinical application of these new modeling neurotechnologies, including epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, ischemic disease, neurorehabilitation, drug addiction, schizophrenia and neurostimulation.","723":"Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) is an urban mosquito involved in the transmission of numerous viruses, including dengue, chikungunya and Zika. In Argentina, Ae. aegypti is the main vector of dengue virus and has been involved in several outbreaks in regions ranging from northern to central Argentina since 2009. In order to evaluate areas of potential vector\u2010borne disease transmission in the city of C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina, the present study aimed to identify the environmental, socioeconomic and demographic factors driving the distribution of Ae. aegypti larvae through spatial analysis in the form of species distribution models (SDMs). These models elucidate relationships between known occurrences of a species and environmental data in order to identify areas with suitable habitats for that species and the consequent risk for disease transmission. The maximum entropy species distribution model was able to fit the training data well, with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of >\u20090.8, and produced models with fair extrapolation capacity (average test AUC: >\u20090.75). Human population density, distance to vegetation and water channels were the main variables predictive of the vector suitability of an area. The results of this work will be used to target surveillance and prevention measures, as well as in mosquito management.","724":"Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are detrimental to the health and economic well-being of society. Consequently, predicting outbreaks and identifying effective disease interventions through epidemiological tools, such as compartmental models, is of the utmost importance. Unfortunately, the ordinary differential equation compartmental models attributed to the work of Kermack and McKendrick require a duration of infection that follows the exponential or Erlang distribution, despite the biological invalidity of such assumptions. As these assumptions negatively impact the quality of predictions, alternative approaches are required that capture how the variability in the duration of infection affects the trajectory of disease and the evaluation of disease interventions. So, we apply a new family of ordinary differential equation compartmental models based on the quantity person-days of infection to predict the trajectory of disease. Importantly, this new family of models features non-exponential and non-Erlang duration of infection distributions without requiring more complex integral and integrodifferential equation compartmental model formulations. As proof of concept, we calibrate our model to recent trends of chlamydia incidence in the U.S. and utilize a novel duration of infection distribution that features periodic hazard rates. We then evaluate how increasing STD screening rates alter predictions of incidence and disability adjusted life-years over a five-year horizon. Our findings illustrate that our family of compartmental models provides a better fit to chlamydia incidence trends than traditional compartmental models, based on Akaike information criterion. They also show new asymptomatic and symptomatic infections of chlamydia peak over drastically different time frames and that increasing the annual STD screening rates from 35% to 40%-70% would annually avert 6.1-40.3 incidence while saving 1.68-11.14 disability adjusted life-years per 1000 people. This suggests increasing the STD screening rate in the U.S. would greatly aid in ongoing public health efforts to curtail the rising trends in preventable STDs.","725":"The overall seroprevalence was 15.4% [9.3%-24.4%] among 480 participants, ranging from 4.0% to 25.5% across the different municipalities. The seroprevalence did not differ according to gender (p = 0.19) or age (p = 0.51). Among SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals, we found that 24.6% [11.5%-45.2%] reported symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Our findings revealed high levels of infection across the territory but a low number of resulting deaths, which can be explained by French Guiana's young population structure.While Latin America has been heavily affected by the pandemic, only a few seroprevalence studies have been conducted there during the first epidemic wave in the first half of 2020.A cross-sectional survey was performed between 15 July 2020 and 23 July 2020 among individuals who visited 4 medical laboratories or 5 health centers for routine screening or clinical management, with the exception of symptomatic suggestive cases of covid-19. Samples were screened for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG directed against domain S1 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using the anti-SARS-CoV-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from Euroimmun.","726":"-means clustering of the recombinant A1\/D genomes revealed a section of envelope (C2gp120-TMgp41) is often inherited intact, whilst a generalized linear model was used to demonstrate significantly fewer breakpoints in the gag-pol and envelope C2-TM regions compared with accessory gene regions. Despite similar recombination patterns in many recombinants, no clearly supported circulating recombinant form (CRF) was found, there was limited evidence of the transmission of breakpoints, and the vast majority (153\/164; 93 per cent) of the A1\/D recombinants appear to be unique recombinant forms. Thus, recombination is pervasive with clear biases in breakpoint location, but CRFs are not a significant feature, characteristic of a complex, and diverse epidemic.","727":"116,704 students from 1,268 schools, ages 9-19.Students self-reported (paper 2014-2018, electronic 2019) ever and past 30-day (current) use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes, as well as frequent use (20-30 days of month).From 2014-2018, current e-cigarette use prevalence increased among never, current and former smokers in HS, but only among never and current smokers in MS (each p-value<0.001). E-cigarette use increases for current HS smokers were primarily among frequent e-cigarette users. In 2018, the absolute number of HS frequent users who were never or former smokers (420,000 combined) surpassed current smokers (370,000). In 2019, current e-cigarette use prevalence for never, former, and current smokers was 17.5% (95% CI: 16.0-19.0), 53.6% (95% CI: 45.2-61.9), and 85.8% (95% CI: 81.6-89.9) for HS students, respectively, and 6.8% (95% CI: 5.9-7.7), 40.8% (95% CI: 34.7-47.0), and 78.0% (95% CI: 71.9-84.2) for MS students. That year, the number of HS never (420,000) and former smokers (570,000) using e-cigarettes frequently eclipsed that of current smokers (390,000).Nationally representative, cross-sectional, school-based survey (National Youth Tobacco Surveys (NYTS)). General linear models accounting for complex survey design compared e-cigarette use prevalence by smoking status by year, overall and stratified by frequency, separately for high school (HS) and middle school (MS) students. The 2019 survey was analyzed separately because of its change in survey methodology.E-cigarette use prevalence and frequency among youth vary by smoking status, with highest levels of use among current smokers. However frequent e-cigarette use among never smokers and former smokers has increased.Reports of youth e-cigarette use often do not disaggregate by underlying smoking status. This study compared annual 2014-2019 youth estimates of past 30-day e-cigarette use prevalence and frequency by smoking status in the United States (US).MSs and HSs in the US.","728":"Influenza is an ribonucleic acid virus with a genome that comprises eight segments. Experiments show that the vast majority of virions fail to express one or more gene segments and thus cannot cause a productive infection on their own. These particles, called semi-infectious particles (SIPs), can induce virion production through complementation when multiple SIPs are present in an infected cell. Previous within-host influenza models did not explicitly consider SIPs and largely ignore the potential effects of coinfection during virus infection. Here, we constructed and analyzed two distinct models explicitly keeping track of SIPs and coinfection: one without spatial structure and the other implicitly considering spatial structure. While the model without spatial structure fails to reproduce key aspects of within-host influenza virus dynamics, we found that the model implicitly considering the spatial structure of the infection process makes predictions that are consistent with biological observations, highlighting the crucial role that spatial structure plays during an influenza infection. This model predicts two phases of viral growth prior to the viral peak: a first phase driven by fully infectious particles at the initiation of infection followed by a second phase largely driven by coinfections of fully infectious particles and SIPs. Fitting this model to two sets of data, we show that SIPs can contribute substantially to viral load during infection. Overall, the model provides a new interpretation of the in vivo exponential viral growth observed in experiments and a mechanistic explanation for why the production of large numbers of SIPs does not strongly impede viral growth. Being simple and predictive, our model framework serves as a useful tool to understand coinfection dynamics in spatially structured acute viral infections.","729":"A major hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) pathogen, coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16), has predominated in several of the last 10 years and caused the largest number of HFMD outbreaks between 2011 and 2018 in China. We evaluated the efficacy of maternal anti-CVA16 antibody transfer via the placenta and explored the dynamics of maternal and natural infection-induced neutralizing antibodies in children.Anti-CVA16 maternal antibodies are efficiently transferred to neonates, but their levels decline quickly. Children aged 0-5 years are the main susceptible population and should be protected by CVA16 vaccination, with the optimal vaccination time between 1.5 months and 1 year of age.The average maternal antibody transfer ratio was 0.88 (95% CI 0.80-0.96). Transferred maternal antibody levels declined rapidly (half-life: 2.0 months, 95% CI 1.9-2.2 months). The GMT decayed below the positive threshold (8) by 1.5 months of age. Due to natural infections, it increased above 8 after 1.4 years and reached 32 by 5 years of age, thereafter dropping slightly. Although the average duration of maternal antibody-mediated protection was < 3 months, the duration extended to 6 months on average for mothers with titres \u2265 64.Two population-based longitudinal cohorts in southern China were studied during 2013-2018. Participants were enrolled in autumn 2013, including 2475 children aged 1-9 years old and 1066 mother-neonate pairs, and followed for 3 years. Blood\/cord samples were collected for CVA16-neutralizing antibody detection. The maternal antibody transfer efficacy, age-specific seroprevalence, geometric mean titre (GMT) and immune response kinetics were estimated.","730":"While e-cigarettes have the potential to promote smoking cessation, their real-world impact is uncertain. In this cohort, dual users were more likely to quit smoking than cigarette-only users, but the overall impact was small because most dual users returned to cigarette-only use. Moreover, e-cigarette dependence promoted continued dual use rather than smoking cessation. Yet, high motivation to quit smoking and the sensory, social, and emotional enjoyment of e-cigarettes facilitated smoking cessation in dual users. Better understanding the barriers and facilitators of transitions can help to develop regulations and interventions that lead to more effective use of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation.We estimated that participants transitioned from cigarette-only to e-cigarette-only through a period of dual use. Dual users ceased smoking (transitioning to e-cigarette-only use) at a greater rate than cigarette-only users did (HR 2.44, 95% CI: 1.49, 4.02). However, of the 60% of dual users estimated to transition to single product use in one year, 83% would transition to cigarette-only use and only 17% to e-cigarette-only use. E-cigarette dependence measures were generally associated with reduced e-cigarette cessation rather than enhanced cigarette cessation. E-cigarette users motivated by harm\/toxicity reduction or because of restrictions on where\/when they could smoke had reduced rates of smoking relapse. Cigarette dependence and spousal smoking were barriers to cigarette cessation for dual users, while using e-cigarettes first in the morning, motivation to quit smoking, and sensory\/social\/emotional enjoyment of e-cigarettes (secondary dependence motives) were facilitators smoking cessation among dual users.Tobacco control policy and interventions may be informed by the barriers and facilitators of product transitions.We followed 380 adult daily cigarette users and dual users every 2 months for up to 2 years. We estimated transition rates between non-current, cigarette-only, e-cigarette-only, and dual use states using a multistate transition model. We estimated univariable hazard ratios (HR) for demographics, dependence measures for cigarettes and e-cigarettes, biomarkers, spousal\/partner behaviors, and other measures.It is uncertain whether e-cigarettes facilitate smoking cessation in the real world. We aimed to understand whether and how transitions among cigarette, e-cigarette, and dual use are associated with sociodemographics, dependence measures, and biomarkers.","731":"The results of this project provide decision-makers with important evidence on the aQIV and support with scientific evidence on the appropriate use of vaccines in the elderly.A HTA was conducted in 2020 to analyze influenza burden; characteristics, efficacy, and safety of aQIV and other available vaccines for the elderly; cost-effectiveness of aQIV; and related organizational and ethical implications. Comprehensive literature reviews\/analyses were performed, and a transmission model was developed in order to address the above issues.The elderly, commonly defined as subjects aged \u226565 years, are among the at-risk subjects recommended for annual influenza vaccination in European countries. Currently, two new vaccines are available for this population: the MF59-adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine (aQIV) and the high-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (hdQIV). Their multidimensional assessment might maximize the results in terms of achievable health benefits. Therefore, we carried out a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) of the aQIV by adopting a multidisciplinary policy-oriented approach to evaluate clinical, economic, organizational, and ethical implications for the Italian elderly.In Italy, the influenza burden on the elderly is high and from 77.7% to 96.1% of influenza-related deaths occur in the elderly. All available vaccines are effective and safe; however, aQIV, such as the adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (aTIV), has proved more immunogenic and effective in the elderly. From the third payer's perspective, but also from the societal one, the use of aQIV in comparison with egg-based standard QIV (eQIV) in the elderly population is cost-effective. The appropriateness of the use of available vaccines as well as citizens' knowledge and attitudes remain a challenge for a successful vaccination campaign.","732":"Confounding factors exist widely in various biological data owing to technical variations, population structures and experimental conditions. Such factors may mask the true signals and lead to spurious associations in the respective biological data, making it necessary to adjust confounding factors accordingly. However, existing confounder correction methods were mainly developed based on the original data or the pairwise Euclidean distance, either one of which is inadequate for analyzing different types of data, such as sequencing data. In this work, we proposed a method called Adjustment for Confounding factors using Principal Coordinate Analysis, or AC-PCoA, which reduces data dimension and extracts the information from different distance measures using principal coordinate analysis, and adjusts confounding factors across multiple datasets by minimizing the associations between lower-dimensional representations and confounding variables. Application of the proposed method was further extended to classification and prediction. We demonstrated the efficacy of AC-PCoA on three simulated datasets and five real datasets. Compared to the existing methods, AC-PCoA shows better results in visualization, statistical testing, clustering, and classification.","733":"Delays often occur between CLSI and FDA revisions of antimicrobial interpretive criteria. Using our Regional Healthcare Ecosystem Analyst (RHEA) simulation model, we found that the 32-month delay in changing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) breakpoints might have resulted in 1,821 additional carriers in Orange County, CA, an outcome that could have been avoided by identifying CRE and initiating contact precautions. Policy makers should aim to minimize the delay in the adoption of new breakpoints for antimicrobials against emerging pathogens when containment of spread is paramount; delays of <1.5 years are ideal.","734":"To compare the HIV-DRMs detected by SS and NGS, we included participants enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) with SS and NGS sequences available with sample collection dates \u22647 days apart. We tested for the presence of HIV-DRMs and compared the agreement between SS and NGS at different variant-calling thresholds.We included 594 pairs of SS and NGS from 527 SHCS participants. Males accounted for 80.5% of the participants, 76.3% were ART naive at sample collection and 78.1% of the sequences were subtype B. Overall, we observed a good agreement (Cohen's kappa >0.80) for HIV-DRMs for variant-calling thresholds \u22655%. We observed an increase in low-abundance HIV-DRMs detected at lower thresholds [28\/417 (6.7%) at 10%-25% to 293\/812 (36.1%) at 1%-2% threshold]. However, such low-abundance HIV-DRMs were overrepresented in ART-naive participants and were in most cases not detected in previously sampled sequences suggesting high sequencing error for thresholds <3%.We found high concordance between SS and NGS but also a substantial number of low-abundance HIV-DRMs detected only by NGS at lower variant-calling thresholds. Our findings suggest that a substantial fraction of the low-abundance HIV-DRMs detected at thresholds <3% may represent sequencing errors and hence should not be overinterpreted in clinical practice.Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is gradually replacing Sanger sequencing (SS) as the primary method for HIV genotypic resistance testing. However, there are limited systematic data on comparability of these methods in a clinical setting for the presence of low-abundance drug resistance mutations (DRMs) and their dependency on the variant-calling thresholds.","735":"Health disparity populations are not well represented in spine pain clinical trials. Embracing key community-based approaches, which have shown promise for increasing participation of underserved communities, is needed.We found the clinical trials had an under-representation of individuals from health disparity populations with lower percentages of racial and ethnic minority groups (Black\/African American 7% lower, Hispanic 8% lower), less educated (No high school degree 19% lower, high school degree 11% lower), and unemployed adults (25% lower) with worse health outcomes (physical health scores 2.5 lower and mental health scores 5.3 lower using the SF-12\/36) relative to the U.S. population with spine pain. While the odds of chiropractic use in the U.S. are lower for individuals from health disparity populations, the trials also under-represented these populations relative to U.S. adults with chronic spine pain who visit a chiropractor.Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for assessing treatment effectiveness; however, they have been criticized for generalizability issues such as how well trial participants represent those who receive the treatments in clinical practice. We assessed the representativeness of participants from eight RCTs for chronic spine pain in the U.S., which were used for an individual participant data meta-analysis on the cost-effectiveness of spinal manipulation for spine pain. In these clinical trials, spinal manipulation was performed by chiropractors.We conducted a retrospective secondary analysis of RCT data to compare trial participants' socio-demographic characteristics, clinical features, and health outcomes to a representative sample of (a) U.S. adults with chronic spine pain and (b) U.S. adults with chronic spine pain receiving chiropractic care, using secondary data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). We assessed differences between trial and U.S. spine populations using independent t-tests for means and z-tests for proportions, accounting for the complex multi-stage survey design of the NHIS and MEPS.","736":"Viral genetic sequencing can be used to monitor the spread of HIV drug resistance, identify appropriate antiretroviral regimes, and characterize transmission dynamics. Despite decreasing costs, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is still prohibitively costly for routine use in generalised HIV epidemics in low- and middle-income countries. Here, we present veSEQ-HIV, a high-throughput, cost-effective NGS sequencing method and computational pipeline tailored specifically to HIV, which can be performed using leftover blood drawn for routine CD4 cell count testing. This method overcomes several major technical challenges that have prevented HIV sequencing from being used routinely in public health efforts: it is fast, robust, and cost-efficient, and generates full genomic sequences of diverse strains of HIV without bias. The complete veSEQ-HIV pipeline provides viral load estimates and quantitative summaries of drug resistance mutations; it also exploits information on within-host viral diversity to construct directed transmission networks. We evaluated the method's performance using 1,620 plasma samples collected from individuals attending 10 large urban clinics in Zambia as part of the HPTN 071-2 study (PopART Phylogenetics). Whole HIV genomes were recovered from 91% of samples with a viral load >1,000 copies\/ml. The cost of the assay (30 GBP per sample) compares favourably with existing VL and HIV genotyping tests, proving an affordable option for combining HIV clinical monitoring with molecular epidemiology and drug resistance surveillance in low-income settings.","737":"A 46 year old man was transfused ten units of packed red blood cells during subtotal colectomy after intraoperative point-of-care testing values demonstrated hemoglobin values less than seven grams per deciliter (g\/dL). A postoperative hemoglobin analyzed in a standard hematologic laboratory revealed a hemoglobin value of 27.8 g\/dL. He underwent emergent red blood cell depletion therapy which decreased his hemoglobin to 7.5 g\/dL. The physiologic consequences of iatrogenic polycythemia caused by massive transfusion during major abdominal surgery must take into account the fluid shifts that interplay between the osmotic load, viscosity of blood, and postoperative third spacing of fluid. Treatment of acute iatrogenic polycythemia can be effectively accomplished by red blood cell depletion therapy. However, fluid shifts caused by massive transfusion followed by rapid red cell depletion produce a unique physiologic state that is without a well-described algorithm for management. ","738":"In this study, we propose a robust approach to handling geo-referenced data and discuss its statistical analysis. The linear regression model has been found inappropriate in this type of study. This motivates us to redefine its error structure to incorporate the spatial components inherent in the data into the model. Therefore, four spatial models emanated from the re-definition of the error structure. We fitted the spatial and the non-spatial linear model to the precipitation data and compared their results. All the spatial models outperformed the non-spatial model. The Spatial Autoregressive with additional autoregressive error structure (SARAR) model is the most adequate among the spatial models. Furthermore, we identified the hot and cold spot locations of precipitation and their spatial distribution in the study area.","739":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic necessitated rapid local public health response, but studies examining the impact of social distancing policies on SARS-CoV-2 transmission have struggled to capture regional-level dynamics. We developed a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered transmission model, parameterized to Colorado, USA\u2012specific data, to estimate the impact of coronavirus disease\u2012related policy measures on mobility and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in real time. During March\u2012June 2020, we estimated unknown parameter values and generated scenario-based projections of future clinical care needs. Early coronavirus disease policy measures, including a stay-at-home order, were accompanied by substantial decreases in mobility and reduction of the effective reproductive number well below 1. When some restrictions were eased in late April, mobility increased to near baseline levels, but transmission remained low (effective reproductive number <1) through early June. Over time, our model was parameterized closer to reality in Colorado, leading to modest changes in estimates of intervention effects and more conservative long-term projections.","740":"Emerging epidemics are challenging to track. Only a subset of cases is recognized and reported, as seen with the Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic where large proportions of infection were asymptomatic. However, multiple imperfect indicators of infection provide an opportunity to estimate the underlying incidence of infection. We developed a modeling approach that integrates a generic Time-series Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemic model with assumptions about reporting biases in a Bayesian framework and applied it to the 2016 Zika epidemic in Puerto Rico using three indicators: suspected arboviral cases, suspected Zika-associated Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome cases, and blood bank data. Using this combination of surveillance data, we estimated the peak of the epidemic occurred during the week of August 15, 2016 (the 33rd week of year), and 120 to 140 (50% credible interval [CrI], 95% CrI: 97 to 170) weekly infections per 10,000 population occurred at the peak. By the end of 2016, we estimated that approximately 890,000 (95% CrI: 660,000 to 1,100,000) individuals were infected in 2016 (26%, 95% CrI: 19% to 33%, of the population infected). Utilizing multiple indicators offers the opportunity for real-time and retrospective situational awareness to support epidemic preparedness and response.","741":"The rapid global evolution of influenza virus begins with mutations that arise de novo in individual infections, but little is known about how evolution occurs within hosts. We review recent progress in understanding how and why influenza viruses evolve within human hosts. Advances in deep sequencing make it possible to measure within-host genetic diversity in both acute and chronic influenza infections. Factors like antigenic selection, antiviral treatment, tissue specificity, spatial structure, and multiplicity of infection may affect how influenza viruses evolve within human hosts. Studies of within-host evolution can contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary and epidemiological factors that shape influenza virus's global evolution.","742":"For many communicable diseases, knowledge of the underlying contact network through which the disease spreads is essential to determining appropriate control measures. When behavior change is the primary intervention for disease prevention, it is important to understand how to best modify network connectivity using the limited resources available to control disease spread. We describe and compare four algorithms for selecting a limited number of links to remove from a network: two \"preventive\" approaches (edge centrality, R0 minimization), where the decision of which links to remove is made prior to any disease outbreak and depends only on the network structure; and two \"reactive\" approaches (S-I edge centrality, optimal quarantining), where information about the initial disease states of the nodes is incorporated into the decision of which links to remove. We evaluate the performance of these algorithms in minimizing the total number of infections that occur over the course of an acute outbreak of disease. We consider different network structures, including both static and dynamic Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi random networks with varying levels of connectivity, a real-world network of residential hotels connected through injection drug use, and a network exhibiting community structure. We show that reactive approaches outperform preventive approaches in averting infections. Among reactive approaches, removing links in order of S-I edge centrality is favored when the link removal budget is small, while optimal quarantining performs best when the link removal budget is sufficiently large. The budget threshold above which optimal quarantining outperforms the S-I edge centrality algorithm is a function of both network structure (higher for unstructured Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi random networks compared to networks with community structure or the real-world network) and disease infectiousness (lower for highly infectious diseases). We conduct a value-of-information analysis of knowing which nodes are initially infected by comparing the performance improvement achieved by reactive over preventive strategies. We find that such information is most valuable for moderate budget levels, with increasing value as disease spread becomes more likely (due to either increased connectedness of the network or increased infectiousness of the disease). ","743":"Point-of-care (POC) devices for infant HIV testing provide timely result-return and increase antiretroviral (ART) initiation. We aimed to optimally locate POC devices to increase 30-day ART initiation in Matabeleland South, Zimbabwe.We developed an optimization model to identify the locations for limited POC devices at health facilities, maximizing the number of infants who receive HIV test results and initiate ART within 30 days of testing. We compared location-optimization model results to non-model-based decision heuristics, which are more practical and less data-intensive. Heuristics assign POC devices based on demand, test positivity, laboratory result-return probability, and POC machine functionality.Optimal and ad hoc heuristic relocation of limited POC machines would increase timely result-return and ART initiation, without further, often costly, interventions. Location optimization can enhance decision-making regarding the placement of medical technologies for HIV care.With the current placement of 11 existing POC machines, 37% of all tested infants with HIV were projected to receive results and 35% were projected to initiate ART within 30 days of testing. With optimal placement of existing machines, 46% were projected to receive results and 44% to initiate ART within 30 days, retaining three machines in current locations, moving eight to new facilities. Relocation based on the highest POC device functionality would be the best-performing heuristic decision (44% receiving results and 42% initiating ART withing 30 days); although, it still would not perform as well as the optimization-based approach.","744":" at the early epidemic stage is comparable with this number for the neighboring ex-USSR country of Ukraine, where much broader NPIs have been implemented. The actual number of cases by the end of May, 2020 was predicted to be 2-9 times higher than the detected number of cases.","745":"Human networks of sexual contacts are dynamic by nature, with partnerships forming and breaking continuously over time. Sexual behaviours are also highly heterogeneous, so that the number of partners reported by individuals over a given period of time is typically distributed as a power-law. Both the dynamism and heterogeneity of sexual partnerships are likely to have an effect in the patterns of spread of sexually transmitted diseases. To represent these two fundamental properties of sexual networks, we developed a stochastic process of dynamic partnership formation and dissolution, which results in power-law numbers of partners over time. Model parameters can be set to produce realistic conditions in terms of the exponent of the power-law distribution, of the number of individuals without relationships and of the average duration of relationships. Using an outbreak of antibiotic resistant gonorrhoea amongst men have sex with men as a case study, we show that our realistic dynamic network exhibits different properties compared to the frequently used static networks or homogeneous mixing models. We also consider an approximation to our dynamic network model in terms of a much simpler branching process. We estimate the parameters of the generation time distribution and offspring distribution which can be used for example in the context of outbreak reconstruction based on genomic data. Finally, we investigate the impact of a range of interventions against gonorrhoea, including increased condom use, more frequent screening and immunisation, concluding that the latter shows great promise to reduce the burden of gonorrhoea, even if the vaccine was only partially effective or applied to only a random subset of the population.","746":"From millimeter-scale insects to meter-scale vertebrates, several animal species exhibit multimodal locomotive capabilities in aerial and aquatic environments. To develop robots capable of hybrid aerial and aquatic locomotion, we require versatile propulsive strategies that reconcile the different physical constraints of airborne and aquatic environments. Furthermore, transitioning between aerial and aquatic environments poses substantial challenges at the scale of microrobots, where interfacial surface tension can be substantial relative to the weight and forces produced by the animal\/robot. We report the design and operation of an insect-scale robot capable of flying, swimming, and transitioning between air and water. This 175-milligram robot uses a multimodal flapping strategy to efficiently locomote in both fluids. Once the robot swims to the water surface, lightweight electrolytic plates produce oxyhydrogen from the surrounding water that is collected by a buoyancy chamber. Increased buoyancy force from this electrochemical reaction gradually pushes the wings out of the water while the robot maintains upright stability by exploiting surface tension. A sparker ignites the oxyhydrogen, and the robot impulsively takes off from the water surface. This work analyzes the dynamics of flapping locomotion in an aquatic environment, identifies the challenges and benefits of surface tension effects on microrobots, and further develops a suite of new mesoscale devices that culminate in a hybrid, aerial-aquatic microrobot.","747":"Predictions of future atmospheric CO2 levels and their impacts depend on understanding the role of the terrestrial biosphere in the carbon cycle. Major efforts have been focused on improving ecosystem models, which are numerical representations of a collection of biogeochemical processes, to improve model performance and generate more realistic predictions. However, despite notable research, model predictions continue to diverge. Here, we consider this issue from an information-theoretic perspective. We choose to measure the complexity of net ecosystem exchange (NEE), an important flux in the global C cycle, and evaluate a \"simple\" case: how NEE switches between a source (positive values) and sink (negative values) of atmospheric CO2 over time, at half-hourly and daily time scales. Instead of assuming specific model formulations for these source-sink dynamics, we let each observed or simulated time series of NEE at 42 sites from North American Carbon Program Site-level Interim Synthesis to inform how NEE is best represented, with the smallest optimal predictors: a type of hidden Markov model called the epsilon machine (eM). The eM internally stores information (measured by its statistical complexity) that must be \"remembered\" to optimally predict future source-sink dynamics. Here we show, at the half-hourly scale, eMs inferred from model-simulated NEE have much lower statistical complexity than those inferred from flux observations, suggesting that simulated NEE source-sink dynamics are less complex and potentially more instantaneous than those of observations. This model-data mismatch is only marginally explained by differences in conventional information measures of entropy rate (i.e., the apparent randomness of source-sink dynamics) and excess entropy (i.e., future source-sink dynamics directly predictable from past states). Such mismatch is not evident at the daily scale. Second, we show that when a site is disturbed, its source-sink dynamics generally decrease in complexity, despite the relatively small change in entropy rate. In summary, these information measures of land-carbon dynamics can provide insights on model adequacy across scales, effects of ecological memory and legacies, and the overall predictability of biosphere C fluxes.","748":"Risk for all three mortality outcomes increased as the ratio of omega-6\/omega-3 PUFAs increased (all Ptrend <0.05). Comparing the highest to the lowest quintiles, individuals had 26% (95% CI, 15-38%) higher total mortality, 14% (95% CI, 0-31%) higher cancer mortality, and 31% (95% CI, 10-55%) higher CVD mortality. Moreover, omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs in plasma were all inversely associated with all-cause, cancer, and CVD mortality, with omega-3 showing stronger effects.We investigated plasma omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs and their ratio in relation to all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a large prospective cohort, the UK Biobank. Of 85,425 participants who had complete information on circulating PUFAs, 6461 died during follow-up, including 2794 from cancer and 1668 from cardiovascular disease (CVD). Associations were estimated by multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression with adjustment for relevant risk factors.Using a population-based cohort in UK Biobank, our study revealed a strong association between the ratio of circulating omega-6\/omega-3 PUFAs and the risk of all-cause, cancer, and CVD mortality.Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institute of Health under the award number R35GM143060 (KY). The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health.Circulating omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been associated with various chronic diseases and mortality, but results are conflicting. Few studies examined the role of omega-6\/omega-3 ratio in mortality.","749":"Emerging evidence supports the use of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) and, in many cases, partial oral antibiotic therapy for the treatment of injection drug use-associated infective endocarditis (IDU-IE); however, long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness remain unknown.To compare the added value of inpatient addiction care services and the cost-effectiveness and clinical outcomes of alternative antibiotic treatment strategies for patients with IDU-IE.The model simulated 4 treatment strategies: (1) 4 to 6 weeks of inpatient intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy along with opioid detoxification (usual care strategy), (2) 4 to 6 weeks of inpatient IV antibiotic therapy along with inpatient addiction care services that offered medication for opioid use disorder (usual care\/addiction care strategy), (3) 3 weeks of inpatient IV antibiotic therapy along with addiction care services followed by OPAT (OPAT strategy), and (4) 3 weeks of inpatient IV antibiotic therapy along with addiction care services followed by partial oral antibiotic therapy (partial oral antibiotic strategy).Mean percentage of patients completing treatment for IDU-IE, deaths associated with IDU-IE, life expectancy (measured in life-years [LYs]), mean cost per person, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).All modeled scenarios were initialized with 5 million individuals (mean age, 42 years; range, 18-64 years; 70% male) who had a history of injection opioid drug use. The usual care strategy resulted in 18.63 LYs at a cost of $416\u202f570 per person, with 77.6% of hospitalized patients completing treatment. Life expectancy was extended by each alternative strategy. The partial oral antibiotic strategy yielded the highest treatment completion rate (80.3%) compared with the OPAT strategy (78.8%) and the usual care\/addiction care strategy (77.6%). The OPAT strategy was the least expensive at $412\u202f150 per person. Compared with the OPAT strategy, the partial oral antibiotic strategy had an ICER of $163\u202f370 per LY. Increasing IDU-IE treatment uptake and decreasing treatment discontinuation made the partial oral antibiotic strategy more cost-effective compared with the OPAT strategy. When assuming that all patients with IDU-IE were eligible to receive partial oral antibiotic therapy, the strategy was cost-saving and resulted in 0.0247 additional discounted LYs. When treatment discontinuation was decreased from 3.30% to 2.65% per week, the partial oral antibiotic strategy was cost-effective compared with OPAT at the $100 000 per LY threshold.This decision analytical modeling study used a validated microsimulation model to compare antibiotic treatment strategies for patients with IDU-IE. Model inputs were derived from clinical trials and observational cohort studies. The model included all patients with injection opioid drug use (N\u2009=\u20095 million) in the US who were eligible to receive OPAT either in the home or at a postacute care facility. Costs were annually discounted at 3%. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated from a health care sector perspective over a lifetime starting in 2020. Probabilistic sensitivity, scenario, and threshold analyses were performed to address uncertainty.In this decision analytical modeling study, incorporation of OPAT or partial oral antibiotic approaches along with addiction care services for the treatment of patients with IDU-IE was associated with increases in the number of people completing treatment, decreases in mortality, and savings in cost compared with the usual care strategy of providing inpatient IV antibiotic therapy alone.","750":"Our results show that Ae. japonicus mosquitoes are actively host seeking throughout the day, with peaks in activity in the morning and evening. Their abundance in August was higher than in June and September. For the host-preference experiment, we documented a small number of mosquitoes feeding on birds: only six blood-fed females were caught over 4 full days of sampling. Finally, our vector competence experiments with Ae. japonicus compared to its natural vector Culex pipiens showed a higher infection and transmission rate when infected with a local, Dutch, WNV isolate compared to a Greek isolate of the virus. Interestingly, we also found a small number of infected Cx. pipiens males with virus-positive leg and saliva samples.Combining the field and laboratory derived data, our model predicts that Ae. japonicus could act as a spillover vector for WNV and could be responsible for a high initial invasion risk of WNV when present in large numbers.In recent years the Asian bush mosquito Aedes japonicus has invaded Europe, including the Netherlands. This species is a known vector for a range of arboviruses, possibly including West Nile virus (WNV). As WNV emerged in the Netherlands in 2020, it is important to investigate the vectorial capacity of mosquito species present in the Netherlands to estimate the risk of future outbreaks and further spread of the virus. Therefore, this study evaluates the potential role of Ae. japonicus in WNV transmission and spillover from birds to dead-end hosts in the Netherlands.We conducted human landing collections in allotment gardens (Lelystad, the Netherlands) in June, August and September 2021 to study the diurnal and seasonal host-seeking behaviour of Ae. japonicus. Furthermore, their host preference in relation to birds using live chicken-baited traps was investigated. Vector competence of field-collected Ae. japonicus mosquitoes for two isolates of WNV at two different temperatures was determined. Based on the data generated from these studies, we developed a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model to calculate the risk of WNV spillover from birds to humans via Ae. japonicus, under the condition that the virus is introduced and circulates in an enzootic cycle in a given area.","751":"The global community has adopted ambitious goals to eliminate schistosomiasis as a public health problem, and new tools are needed to achieve them. Mass drug administration programs, for example, have reduced the burden of schistosomiasis, but the identification of hotspots of persistent and reemergent transmission threaten progress toward elimination and underscore the need to couple treatment with interventions that reduce transmission. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies make whole-genome sequencing a valuable and increasingly feasible option for population-based studies of complex parasites such as schistosomes. Here, we focus on leveraging genomic data to tailor interventions to distinct social and ecological circumstances. We consider two priority questions that can be addressed by integrating epidemiological, ecological, and genomic information: (1) how often do non-human host species contribute to human schistosome infection? and (2) what is the importance of locally acquired versus imported infections in driving transmission at different stages of elimination? These questions address processes that can undermine control programs, especially those that rely heavily on treatment with praziquantel. Until recently, these questions were difficult to answer with sufficient precision to inform public health decision-making. We review the literature related to these questions and discuss how whole-genome approaches can identify the geographic and taxonomic sources of infection, and how such information can inform context-specific efforts that advance schistosomiasis control efforts and minimize the risk of reemergence.","752":"External cohort at Sainte-Justine Hospital PICU (Montreal, QC, Canada) from 2017 to 2020.To validate a continuous and noninvasive method to estimate hypoxemia severity for all Spo2 values.We estimated the Pao2 using three kinds of neural networks and an empirically optimized mathematical model derived from known physiologic equations.We included 52,879 Pao2 (3,252 patients) in the derivation dataset and 12,047 Pao2 (926 patients) in the validation dataset. The mean function on the last minute before the arterial blood gas had the lowest bias (bias -0.1% validation cohort). A difference greater than or equal to 3% between pulse rate and electrical heart rate decreased the intraclass correlation coefficients (0.75 vs 0.44; p < 0.001) implying measurement noise. Our estimated Pao2 equation had the highest intraclass correlation coefficient (0.38; 95% CI, 0.36-0.39; validation cohort) and outperformed neural networks and existing equations. Using the estimated Pao2 to estimate the oxygenation index showed a significantly better hypoxemia classification (kappa) than oxygenation saturation index for both Spo2 less than or equal to 97% (0.79 vs 0.60; p < 0.001) and Spo2 greater than 97% (0.58 vs 0.52; p < 0.001).All patients who had an arterial blood gas and simultaneous continuous noninvasive monitoring from 2011 to 2019 at Boston Children's Hospital (Boston, MA) PICU.The estimated Pao2 using pulse rate and electrical heart rate Spo2 validation allows a continuous and noninvasive estimation of the oxygenation index that is valid for Spo2 less than or equal to 97% and for Spo2 greater than 97%. Display of continuous analysis of estimated Pao2 and estimated oxygenation index may provide decision support to assist with hypoxemia diagnosis and oxygen titration in critically ill patients.Pao2 is the gold standard to assess acute hypoxic respiratory failure, but it is only routinely available by intermittent spot checks, precluding any automatic continuous analysis for bedside tools.","753":"Evidence on the economic impact of novel skin tests for tuberculosis infection (TBST) is scarce and limited by study quality. We used estimates on the cost-effectiveness of the use of TBST compared to current tuberculosis infection (TBI) tests to assess whether TBST are affordable and feasible to implement under different country contexts. A Markov model parametrised to Brazil, South Africa and the UK was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of three TBI testing strategies: (1) Diaskintest (DST), (2) TST test, and (3) IGRA QFT test. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses over unit costs and main parameters were performed. Our modelling results show that Diaskintest saves $5.60 and gains 0.024 QALYs per patient and $8.40, and 0.01 QALYs per patient in Brazil, compared to TST and IGRA respectively. In South Africa, Diaskintest is also cost-saving at $4.39, with 0.015 QALYs per patient gained, compared to TST, and $64.41, and 0.007 QALYs per patient, compared to IGRA. In the UK, Diaskintest saves $73.33, and gaines 0.0351 QALYs per patient, compared to TST. However, Diaskintest, compared to IGRA, showed an incremental cost of $521.45 (95% CI (500.94-545.07)) per QALY, below the willingness-to-pay threshold of $20.223 per QALY. Diaskintest potentially saves costs and results in greater health gains than the TST and IGRA tests in Brazil and South Africa. In the UK Diaskintest would gain health but also be more costly. Our results have potential external validity because TBST remained cost-effective despite extensive sensitivity analyses.","754":" NHP model confirmed that the decellularized NAC grafts encourage neovascularization as well as re-epithelialization. These results support the concept that a biologically derived acellular nipple graft is a feasible approach for nipple reconstruction, supporting neovascularization in the absence of adverse systemic responses. Impact statement Currently, women in the United States most often undergo a mastectomy, followed by reconstruction, after being diagnosed with breast cancer. These breast cancer survivors are often left with nipple-areolar complex (NAC) reconstructions that are subsatisfactory, nonliving, and\/or nonpermanent. Utilizing an acellular biologically derived whole NAC graft would allow these patients a living and permanent tissue engineering solution to nipple reconstruction.","755":" = 0.0003).

Here, we synthesize the current understanding of MI and infectious disease to stimulate more research, specifically aiming to leverage concepts and tools from disease ecology and related fields to generate testable hypotheses. Embracing a One Health perspective, we examine both human-to-human and zoonotic transmission pathways in their environmental contexts to assess how MI alters infectious disease exposure and susceptibility in beneficial, detrimental and mixed ways. For human-to-human transmission, we consider how markets expand contact networks in ways that facilitate infectious disease transmission while also increasing access to hygiene products and housing materials that likely reduce infections. For zoonotic transmission, MI influences exposures to pathogens through agricultural intensification and other market-driven processes that may increase or decrease human encounters with disease reservoirs or vectors in their shared environments. We also consider how MI-driven changes in noncommunicable diseases affect immunocompetence and susceptibility to infectious disease. Throughout, we identify statistical, survey and laboratory methods from ecology and the social sciences that will advance interdisciplinary research on MI and infectious disease.","757":"Investments in water and sanitation systems are believed to have led to the decline in typhoid fever in developed countries, such that most cases now occur in regions lacking adequate clean water and sanitation. Exploring seasonal and long-term patterns in historical typhoid mortality in the United States can offer deeper understanding of disease drivers. We fit modified Time-series Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered models to city-level weekly mortality counts to estimate seasonal and long-term typhoid transmission. We examined seasonal transmission separately by city and aggregated by water source. Typhoid transmission peaked in late summer\/early fall. Seasonality varied by water source, with the greatest variation occurring in cities with reservoirs. We then fit hierarchical regression models to measure associations between long-term transmission and annual financial investments in water and sewer systems. Overall historical $1 per capita ($16.13 in 2017) investments in the water supply were associated with approximately 5% (95% confidence interval: 3-6%) decreases in typhoid transmission, while $1 increases in the overall sewer system investments were associated with estimated 6% (95% confidence interval: 4-9%) decreases. Our findings aid in the understanding of typhoid transmission dynamics and potential impacts of water and sanitation improvements, and can inform cost-effectiveness analyses of interventions to reduce the typhoid burden.","758":"Number of pregnant women infected with ZIKV and number of congenital microcephaly cases.The estimate of 5900 to 10\u202f300 pregnant women that might be infected with ZIKV provides an estimate for the number of infants that could potentially have ZIKV-associated adverse outcomes. Including baseline cases of microcephaly, we estimated that an IQR of 110 to 290 total cases of congenital microcephaly, mostly attributable to ZIKV infection, could occur from mid-2016 to mid-2017 in the absence of effective interventions. The primary limitation in this analysis is uncertainty in model parameters. Multivariate sensitivity analyses indicated that the cumulative incidence of ZIKV infection and risk of microcephaly given maternal infection in the first trimester were the primary drivers of both magnitude and uncertainty in the estimated number of microcephaly cases. Increased information on these parameters would lead to more precise estimates. Nonetheless, the results underscore the need for urgent actions being undertaken in Puerto Rico to prevent congenital ZIKV infection and prepare for affected infants.We estimated an IQR of 5900 to 10\u202f300 pregnant women (median, 7800) might be infected during the initial ZIKV outbreak in Puerto Rico. Of these, an IQR of 100 to 270 infants (median, 180) may be born with microcephaly due to congenital ZIKV infection from mid-2016 to mid-2017. In the absence of a ZIKV outbreak, an IQR of 9 to 16 cases (median, 12) of congenital microcephaly are expected in Puerto Rico per year.Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital microcephaly and severe fetal brain defects, and it has been associated with other adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes.To estimate the number of pregnant women infected with ZIKV in Puerto Rico and the number of associated congenital microcephaly cases.We conducted a modeling study from April to July 2016. Using parameters derived from published reports, outcomes were modeled probabilistically using Monte Carlo simulation. We used uncertainty distributions to reflect the limited information available for parameter values. Given the high level of uncertainty in model parameters, interquartile ranges (IQRs) are presented as primary results. Outcomes were modeled for pregnant women in Puerto Rico, which currently has more confirmed ZIKV cases than any other US location.Zika virus infection in pregnant women.","759":"Use of the genomic classifier reduced invasive procedures by 28% at 1 month and 18% at 2 years, respectively. Total costs and QALY gain were similar with classifier use ($27,221 versus $27,183 and 1.512 versus 1.509, respectively), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $15,052 per QALY.Our analysis suggests that the use of a genomic classifier is associated with meaningful reductions in invasive procedures at about equal costs and is therefore a high-value strategy in the diagnostic work-up of patients at intermediate risk of lung cancer.The use of a bronchial genomic classifier has been shown to improve the diagnostic accuracy of bronchoscopy for suspected lung cancer by identifying patients who may be more suitable for radiographic surveillance as opposed to invasive procedures. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of bronchoscopy plus a genomic classifier versus bronchoscopy alone in the diagnostic work-up of patients at intermediate risk for lung cancer.A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to project the costs and effects of two competing strategies by using test performance from the Airway Epithelial Gene Expression in the Diagnosis of Lung Cancer-1 and Airway Epithelial Gene Expression in the Diagnosis of Lung Cancer-2 studies. The diagnostic accuracy of noninvasive and invasive follow-up, as well as associated adverse event rates, were derived from published literature. Procedure costs were based on claims data and 2016 inpatient and outpatient reimbursement amounts. The model projected the number of invasive follow-up procedures, 2-year costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) by strategy, and resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio discounted at 3% per annum.","760":"The United States remains a distance below the threshold sufficient to disrupt viral transmission, with some states remarkably low. As more infectious variants emerge, it is critical that vaccination efforts intensify across all states and ages for which the vaccines are approved.Publicly available data as of August 26, 2021, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were used to calculate presumed population immunity by state. Seroprevalence data were used to estimate the percentage of the population previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, with adjustments for underreporting. Vaccination coverage data for both fully and partially vaccinated persons were used to calculate presumed immunity from vaccination. Finally, we estimated the percentage of the total population in each state with presumed immunity to SARS-CoV-2, with a sensitivity analysis to account for waning immunity, and compared these estimates with a range of population immunity thresholds.In our main analysis, which was the most optimistic scenario, presumed population immunity varied among states (43.1% to 70.6%), with 19 states with \u226460% of their population having been infected or vaccinated. Four states had presumed immunity greater than thresholds estimated to be sufficient to disrupt transmission of less infectious variants (67%), and none were greater than the threshold estimated for more infectious variants (\u226578%).Information is needed to monitor progress toward a level of population immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sufficient to disrupt viral transmission. We estimated the percentage of the US population with presumed immunity to SARS-CoV-2 due to vaccination, natural infection, or both as of August 26, 2021.","761":"Habitat fragmentation is postulated to be a major factor influencing infectious disease dynamics in wildlife populations and may also be responsible, at least in part, for the recent spurt in the emergence, or re-emergence, of infectious diseases in humans. The mechanism behind these relationships are poorly understood due to the lack of insights into the interacting local factors and insufficient baseline data in ecological parasitology of wildlife. Here, we studied the gastrointestinal parasites of nonhuman mammalian hosts living in 10 rainforest patches of the Anamalai Tiger Reserve, India. We examined 349 faecal samples of 17 mammalian species and successfully identified 24 gastrointestinal parasite taxa including 1 protozoan, 2 trematode, 3 cestode and 18 nematode taxa. Twenty of these parasites are known parasites of humans. We also found that as much as 73% of all infected samples were infected by multiple parasites. In addition, the smallest and most fragmented forest patches recorded the highest parasite richness; the pattern across fragments, however, seemed to be less straightforward, suggesting potential interplay of local factors.","762":"Background Successful vaccination against the H1N1 Influenza A virus has required the continuous development of new vaccines that are antigenically similar to currently circulating strains. Vaccine strategies that can increase the cross-reactivity of the antibody response, especially to conserved regions, are essential to creating long-lasting immunity to H1N1 viruses. How pre-existing immunity affects vaccine-induced antibody cross-reactivity is still not well understood.\r\n\r\nMethods An immunological shape space of antigenic sites of hemagglutinin (HA) was constructed using viral sequence data. A Gillespie Algorithm-based model of the humoral immune system was used to simulate B cell responses to A\/California\/07\/2009 (CA09) HA antigen after prior immunization with an antigenically similar or dissimilar strain. The effect of pre-existing memory B cells and antibody on the resulting antibody responses was interrogated.\r\n\r\nResults We found increased levels of highly-cross-reactive antibodies after immunization with antigenically dissimilar strains. This increase was dependent on pre-existing memory B cells. Furthermore, pre-existing antibody also interfered with the cross-reactive antibody response, but this effect occurred irrespective of the priming antigen.\r\n\r\nConclusion These findings suggest that vaccination by divergent strains will boost highly-cross-reactive antibodies by selectively targeting memory B cells specific to conserved antigenic sites and by reducing the negative interference caused by pre-existing antibody.","763":" gene on the X chromosome has varying numbers of CGG repeats. The modal number is 30, and expansion to >200 results in fragile X syndrome, but the copy number extends down to 6. Past research suggests that individuals whose CGGs are in the \"low zone\" (LZ; defined here as \u2264 25 CGGs) may be more environmentally-reactive than those with normal range repeats (26-40 CGGs)-a gene x environment interaction. Using a population-based DNA biobank, in our primary analysis we compared 96 mothers with LZ CGG repeats on both alleles to 280 mothers who had CGG repeats in the normal range. Secondarily, we conducted parallel analyses on fathers. We investigated how parents in these two CGG repeat categories differentially responded to stress, defined as parenting a child with disabilities. Significant gene x environment interactions indicated that LZ mothers who had children with disabilities had greater limitations (in executive functioning, depression, anxiety, daily health symptoms, and balance) than LZ mothers whose children did not have disabilities. In contrast, mothers with normal-range CGG repeats did not differ based on stress exposure. For fathers, a similar pattern was evident for one phenotype only (hand tremors). Although on average LZ CGGs are not associated with compromised functioning, the average masks differential response to the environment.","764":"We identified 8 new studies and analyzed 27 studies in total. Our analyses showed that while the general insights on the protective (or harmful) impact of improved (or unimproved) WASH remain the same, the pooled estimates of OR differed. Pooled estimates of limited hygiene (OR\u2009=\u20092.26, 95% CrI: 1.38 to 3.64), untreated water (OR\u2009=\u20091.96, 95% CrI: 1.28 to 3.27) and surface water (OR\u2009=\u20092.14, 95% CrI: 1.03 to 4.06) showed 3% increase, 18% decrease, and 16% increase, respectively, from the existing estimates. On the other hand, improved WASH reduced the odds of typhoid fever with pooled estimates for improved water source (OR\u2009=\u20090.54, 95% CrI: 0.31 to 1.08), basic hygiene (OR\u2009=\u20090.6, 95% CrI: 0.38 to 0.97) and treated water (OR\u2009=\u20090.54, 95% CrI: 0.36 to 0.8) showing 26% decrease, 15% increase, and 8% decrease, respectively, from the existing estimates.PROSPERO 2021 CRD42021271881.We updated the previous review conducted by Brockett et al. We included new findings published between June 2018 and October 2022 in Web of Science, Embase, and PubMed. We used the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for risk of bias (ROB) assessment. We classified WASH exposures according to the classification provided by the WHO\/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene (JMP) update in 2015. We conducted the meta-analyses by only including studies that did not have a critical ROB in both Bayesian and frequentist random-effects models.The updated pooled estimates of ORs for the association of WASH with typhoid fever showed clear changes from the existing estimates. Our study affirms that relatively low-cost WASH strategies such as basic hygiene or water treatment can be an effective tool to provide protection against typhoid fever in addition to other resource-intensive ways to improve WASH.Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) play a pivotal role in controlling typhoid fever, as it is primarily transmitted through oral-fecal pathways. Given our constrained resources, staying current with the most recent research is crucial. This ensures we remain informed about practical insights regarding effective typhoid fever control strategies across various WASH components.\u00a0We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies to estimate the associations of water, sanitation, and hygiene exposures with typhoid fever.","765":"Prior to the peak of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, cumulative incidence as assessed by serology approached 50% in a Brazilian urban slum population. In contrast to observations from industrialized countries, SARS-CoV-2 incidence was highest among children, as well as women living in extreme poverty. These findings emphasize the need for targeted interventions that provide safe environments for children and mitigate the structural risks posed by crowding and poverty for the most vulnerable residents of urban slum communities.The structural environment of urban slums, including physical, demographic, and socioeconomic attributes, renders inhabitants more vulnerable to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Yet, little is known about the specific determinants that contribute to high transmission within these communities. We therefore aimed to investigate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in an urban slum in Brazil.We performed a cross-sectional serosurvey of an established cohort of 2,041 urban slum residents from the city of Salvador, Brazil between November 2020 and February 2021, following the first Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic wave in the country and during the onset of the second wave. The median age in this population was 29 years (interquartile range [IQR] 16 to 44); most participants reported their ethnicity as Black (51.5%) or Brown (41.7%), and 58.5% were female. The median size of participating households was 3 (IQR 2 to 4), with a median daily per capita income of 2.32 (IQR 0.33-5.15) US Dollars. The main outcome measure was presence of IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We implemented multilevel models with random intercepts for each household to estimate seroprevalence and associated risk factors, adjusting for the sensitivity and specificity of the assay, and the age and gender distribution of our study population. We identified high seroprevalence (47.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 44.2% to 52.1%), particularly among female residents (50.3% [95% CI 46.3% to 54.8%] versus 44.6% [95% CI 40.1% to 49.4%] among male residents, p < 0.01) and among children (54.4% [95% CI 49.6% to 59.3%] versus 45.4% [95% CI 41.5% to 49.7%] among adults, p < 0.01). Adults residing in households with children were more likely to be seropositive (48.6% [95% CI 44.8% to 52.3%] versus 40.7% [95% CI 37.2% to 44.3%], p < 0.01). Women who were unemployed and living below the poverty threshold (daily per capita household income <$1.25) were more likely to be seropositive compared to men with the same employment and income status (53.9% [95% CI 47.0% to 60.6%] versus 32.9% [95% CI 23.2% to 44.3%], p < 0.01). Participation in the study was voluntary, which may limit the generalizability of our findings.","766":"Despite the wealth of available climate data available, there is no consensus on the most appropriate product choice for health impact modelling and how this influences downstream climate-health decisions.

Targeted MDA, sometimes referred to as focal MDA, is the practice of delivering MDA to high incidence subpopulations only, rather than the entire population. The potential effectiveness of delivering targeted MDA was demonstrated in a recent intervention in Kayin State, Myanmar. Policymakers and funders need to know what resources are required if MDA, targeted or otherwise, is to be included in elimination packages beyond existing malaria interventions. This study aims to estimate the programmatic cost and the unit cost of targeted MDA in Kayin State, Myanmar.We used financial data from a malaria elimination initiative, conducted in Kayin State, to estimate the programmatic costs of the targeted MDA component using a micro-costing approach. Three activities (community engagement, identification of villages for targeted MDA, and conducting mass treatment in target villages) were evaluated. We then estimated the programmatic costs of implementing targeted MDA to support P. falciparum malaria elimination in Kayin State. A costing tool was developed to aid future analyses.The cost of delivering targeted MDA within an integrated malaria elimination initiative in eastern Kayin State was approximately US$ 910,000. The cost per person reached, distributed among those in targeted and non-targeted villages, for the MDA component was US$ 2.5.This cost analysis can assist policymakers in determining the resources required to clear malaria parasite reservoirs. The analysis demonstrated the value of using financial data from research activities to predict programmatic implementation costs of targeting MDA to different numbers of target villages.","768":"LBCTR2023015206, Registered in 2023.National Institutes of Mental Health, NCT05265611, Registered prospectively in 2021.This pilot randomized controlled trial protocol aims to (1) assess the impact on the wellbeing of Syrian refugee young adults (18-24 years) of being a community mental health worker (CMHW) implementing WHO's evidence-based psychosocial intervention - Problem Management Plus (PM+) - with adults in their community, and (2) identify the mechanisms associated with the outcomes of enhanced wellbeing and coping, and reduced stress among these CMHWs. Over 108 million people have been forcibly displaced as of the end of 2022. Mental health consequences of these displacements are significant, yet human resources for health are not sufficient to meet the needs. A large proportion of refugee populations are youth and young adults (YA). Evidence indicates their engagement in supporting their communities leads to their own enhanced wellbeing and that of their community. This trial trains Syrian refugees to serve their communities as CMHW (n=19) or tutors (n=19) and compare wellbeing, stress and coping outcomes between these two groups and a control group (n\u00a0=\u00a040). We will also assess 7 mechanisms as potential pathways for the interventions to influence outcomes. Surveys will assess outcomes and mechanisms, hair samples will measure stress cortisol. The primary analysis will use a Bayesian Hierarchical Model approach to model the trajectories of the mechanisms and primary study endpoints over time for individuals in each of the arms. Our results will elucidate critical mechanisms in which engagement of young adults to support their community enhances their own wellbeing.","769":"Eleven databases were searched for primary research studies that fed tylosin at approved doses to feedlot cattle and tested bacteria of interest for phenotypic or genotypic resistance. We screened 1,626 citations and identified 13 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Enterococcus species were tested in seven studies, Escherichia coli was isolated in five studies, three studies reported on Salmonella, and two studies reported on Campylobacter species. Most studies relied on phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing and seven also reported resistance gene testing. A random-effects meta-analyses of erythromycin-resistant enterococci from four studies had significant residual heterogeneity. Only two studies were available for a meta-analysis of tylosin-resistant enterococci. A semi-quantitative analysis demonstrated an increase in macrolide-resistant enterococci after long durations of tylosin administration (>100 days). Semi-quantitative analyses of other bacteria-antimicrobial combinations revealed mixed results, but many comparisons found no effect of tylosin administration. However, about half of these no-effect comparisons did not record the cumulative days of tylosin administration or the time since the last dose.Tylosin is a commonly used in-feed antimicrobial and is approved in several countries to reduce the incidence of liver abscesses in beef cattle. Macrolides are critically important antimicrobials in human health and used to treat some foodborne bacterial diseases, such as Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella. Feeding tylosin could select for resistant enteric bacteria in cattle, which could contaminate beef products at slaughter and potentially cause foodborne illness. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of feeding tylosin to cattle on phenotypic and genotypic resistance in several potential zoonotic enteric bacteria: Enterococcus species, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica, and Campylobacter species. This review was registered with PROSPERO (#CRD42018085949).When fed at approved dosages for typical durations, tylosin increases the proportion of macrolide-resistant enterococci in the cattle gastrointestinal tract, which could pose a zoonotic risk to human beef consumers. Feeding tylosin for short durations may mitigate the impact on macrolide-resistant enterococci and further studies are encouraged to determine the effect of minimizing or eliminating tylosin use in beef cattle. There may also be an impact on other bacteria and other antimicrobial resistances but additional details or data are needed to strengthen these comparisons. We encourage authors of antimicrobial-resistance studies to follow reporting guidelines and publish details of all comparisons to strengthen future meta-analyses.","770":"Emerging diseases must make a transition from stuttering chains of transmission to sustained chains of transmission, but this critical transition need not coincide with the system becoming supercritical. That is, the introduction of infection to a supercritical system results in a significant fraction of the population becoming infected only with a certain probability. Understanding the waiting time to the first major outbreak of an emerging disease is then more complicated than determining when the system becomes supercritical. We treat emergence as a dynamic bifurcation, and use the concept of bifurcation delay to understand the time to emergence after a system becomes supercritical. Specifically, we consider an SIR model with a time-varying transmission term and random infections originating from outside the population. We derive an analytic density function for the delay times and find it to be, in general, in agreement with stochastic simulations. We find the key parameters to be the rate of introduction of infection and the rate of change of the basic reproductive ratio. These findings aid our understanding of real emergence events, and can be incorporated into early-warning systems aimed at forecasting disease risk.","771":"Human mobility is a core component of human behavior and its quantification is critical for understanding its impact on infectious disease transmission, traffic forecasting, access to resources and care, intervention strategies, and migratory flows. When mobility data are limited, spatial interaction models have been widely used to estimate human travel, but have not been extensively validated in low- and middle-income settings. Geographic, sociodemographic, and infrastructure differences may impact the ability for models to capture these patterns, particularly in rural settings. Here, we analyzed mobility patterns inferred from mobile phone data in four Sub-Saharan African countries to investigate the ability for variants on gravity and radiation models to estimate travel. Adjusting the gravity model such that parameters were fit to different trip types, including travel between more or less populated areas and\/or different regions, improved model fit in all four countries. This suggests that alternative models may be more useful in these settings and better able to capture the range of mobility patterns observed.","772":"We discuss several issues of statistical design, data collection, analysis, communication, and decision-making that have arisen in recent and ongoing coronavirus studies, focusing on tools for assessment and propagation of uncertainty.

The spike 0-domain retains homology to CCoV2b (enteric infections) and Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV; enteric and respiratory). This domain is subject to relaxed selection pressure and an increased rate of molecular evolution. It contains unique amino acid substitutions, including within a region important for sialic acid binding and pathogenesis in TGEV. Overall, the spike gene is extensively recombinant, with a feline coronavirus type II strain serving a prominent role in the recombinant history of the virus. Molecular divergence time for a segment of the gene where temporal signal could be determined, was estimated at around 60 years ago. We hypothesize that the virus had an enteric origin, but that it may be losing that particular tropism, possibly because of mutations in the sialic acid binding region of the spike 0-domain.","774":"Bacteria inhibit and kill one another with a diverse array of compounds, including bacteriocins and antibiotics. These attacks are highly regulated, but we lack a clear understanding of the evolutionary logic underlying this regulation. Here, we combine a detailed dynamic model of bacterial competition with evolutionary game theory to study the rules of bacterial warfare. We model a large range of possible combat strategies based upon the molecular biology of bacterial regulatory networks. Our model predicts that regulated strategies, which use quorum sensing or stress responses to regulate toxin production, will readily evolve as they outcompete constitutive toxin production. Amongst regulated strategies, we show that a particularly successful strategy is to upregulate toxin production in response to an incoming competitor's toxin, which can be achieved via stress responses that detect cell damage (competition sensing). Mirroring classical game theory, our work suggests a fundamental advantage to reciprocation. However, in contrast to classical results, we argue that reciprocation in bacteria serves not to promote peaceful outcomes but to enable efficient and effective attacks.","775":"Participants included 150 PWID receiving HCV treatment at opioid agonist treatment clinics in Bronx, NY. The EQ-5D-3L measurement tool assessed five health dimensions producing an index of HRQOL measured at baseline, 4-, 8-, and 12-weeks during treatment and 12- and 24-weeks post-treatment. PSU was determined at baseline. Generalized estimating equations assessed the influence of baseline PSU on changes in mean EQ-5D-3L index over time.For individuals with PWID, our study showed no difference in HRQOL between those who did and did not engage in PSU following HCV treatment.Treating hepatitis C virus (HCV) in people who inject drugs (PWID) has been associated with increased health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Polysubstance use (PSU) is common among PWID, but no studies have investigated PSU influence on PWID's HRQOL HCV treatment.Of the 150 participants, 46 (30.7%) reported PSU and mean HRQOL overall was 0.655, indicating moderate HRQOL. Mean HRQOL was lower at all time-points for the PSU group compared to the non-PSU group. Though PSU group showed improvements in mean HRQOL from baseline (0.614) to 4-, 12- and follow-up week 24 (0.765, 0.768, and 0.731, respectively), the mean change of HRQOL scores was not significantly associated with PSU (p-value=0.956).","776":"Analyses of individual countries were not supportive of either hypothesis. When analyzed collectively, however, human populations showed consistently lower than expected richness of protozoa and helminths, but higher richness of viruses. Thus, human evolutionary innovations and new parasite exposures may have impacted groups of parasites in different ways, with support for both hypotheses in the overall analysis.In absolute terms, humans are extremely highly parasitized compared to other primates. This may reflect that humans are outliers in traits correlated with parasite richness: population density, geographic range area, and study effort. The high degree of parasitism could also reflect amplified disease risk associated with agriculture and urbanization. Alternatively, controlling for other variables, cultural and psychological adaptations could have reduced parasitism in humans over evolutionary time.Vastly more parasite species infect humans than any other primate host. Controlling for factors that influence parasite richness, such as the intensity of study effort and body mass, we find that humans may have more viruses, but fewer helminths and protozoa, than expected based on evolutionary analyses of parasitism in other primates.We predicted the number of parasites that would infect a nonhuman primate with human phenotypic characteristics and phylogenetic position, and then compared observed parasitism of humans in eight geopolitical countries to the predicted distributions. The analyses incorporated study effort, phylogeny, and drivers of parasitism in 33 primate species.The high level of parasitism observed in humans only applies to viruses, and was not extreme in any of our tests of individual countries. In contrast, we find consistent reductions in protozoa and helminths across countries, suggesting reduced parasitism by these groups during human evolution. We propose that hygienic and technological advances might have extinguished fecal-orally or indirectly transmitted parasites like helminths, whereas higher human densities and host-shifting potential of viruses have supported increased virus richness.","777":"Most deaths from severe falciparum malaria occur within 24 hours of presentation to hospital. Intravenous (i.v.) artesunate is the first-line treatment for severe falciparum malaria, but its efficacy may be compromised by delayed parasitological responses. In patients with severe malaria the life-saving benefit of the artemisinin derivatives is their ability to clear circulating parasites rapidly, before they can sequester and obstruct the microcirculation. To evaluate the dosing of i.v. artesunate for the treatment of artemisinin-sensitive and reduced ring stage sensitivity to artemisinin severe falciparum malaria infections Bayesian pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling of data from 94 patients with severe malaria (80 children from Africa and 14 adults from Southeast Asia) was performed. Assuming delayed parasite clearance reflects a loss of ring stage sensitivity to artemisinin derivatives, the median (95% credible interval) percentage of patients clearing \u226599% parasites within 24 hours (PC24\u226599%) for standard (2.4 mg\/kg i.v. artesunate at 0 and 12 hours) and simplified (4 mg\/kg i.v. artesunate at 0 hours) regimens were 65% (52.5%-74.5%) versus 44% (25%-61.5%) for adults, 62% (51.5%-74.5%) versus 39% (20.5%-58.5%) for larger children (\u226520 kg) and 60% (48.5%-70%) versus 36% (20%-53.5%) for smaller children (<20 kg). The upper limit of the credible intervals for all regimens was below a PC24\u226599% of 80%, a threshold achieved on average in clinical studies of severe falciparum malaria infections. Rapid clearance of parasites, where there is loss of ring stage sensitivity to artemisinin, in patients with severe falciparum malaria is compromised with the currently recommended and proposed simplified i.v. artesunate dosing regimens.","778":"The Ministries of Health in Benin in Mozambique recognized known barriers to the immunization supply chain and undertook a system redesign to address those barriers. Changes were made to introduce an informed push system while consolidating storage points, introducing transport loops, and increasing human resource capacity for distribution. Evaluations were completed in each country.Evaluation in each country indicated improved performance of the supply chain. The Effective Vaccine Management (EVM) assessment in Benin documented notable improvements in the distribution criteria of the tool, increasing from 40% to 100% at the district level. In Mozambique, results showed reduced stockouts at health facility level from 79% at baseline to less than 1% at endline. Coverage rates of DTP3 also increased from 68.9% to 92.8%.Evidence suggests that immunization supply chains are becoming outdated and unable to deliver needed vaccines due to growing populations and new vaccine introductions. Redesigning a supply chain could result in meeting current demands.Benin and Mozambique are undertaking system redesign in order to respond to constraints identified in the vaccine supply chain. Results and learnings show improvements in supply chain performance and make a strong case for system redesign. These countries demonstrate the feasibility of system redesign for other countries considering how to address outdated supply chains.","779":"At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to this day, US state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments lacked comprehensive case investigation and contact tracing (CI\/CT) guidelines that clearly define the capabilities and capacities of CI\/CT programs and how to scale up these programs to respond to outbreaks. This research aims to identify the capabilities and capacities of CI\/CT programs and to develop a conceptual framework that represents the relationships between these program components.This research resulted in the first comprehensive analysis of the capabilities and capacities of CI\/CT programs and a conceptual framework that illustrates the interrelationships between the capacities, capabilities, outcomes, and impacts of CI\/CT programs.This study conducted a narrative literature review and qualitative interviews with 10 US state and local health departments and 4 public health experts to identify and characterize the capacities and capabilities of CI\/CT programs.Our findings highlight the need for further guidance to assist jurisdictional health departments in shifting CI\/CT program goals as outbreaks evolve. Training the public health workforce on making decisions around CI\/CT program implementation during outbreaks is critical to ensure readiness for a variety of outbreak scenarios.","780":"This Special Issue is dedicated to issues and challenges related to pandemic risk and resilience, with a focus on policy and operations of global systems in the COVID-19 pandemic.

As insights grow, effective and targeted therapies are being developed to improve HDV management.Hepatitis D Virus (HDV), although a small defective virus, poses a substantial public health challenge due to lack of awareness, underrecognized prevalence, and limited treatment options. Universal HDV screening within hepatitis B virus (HBV) cohorts is essential to address this issue. Despite its aggressive nature, effective HDV therapies have remained elusive for over four decades.This review delves into HDV's intricate structure and biology, highlighting formidable hurdles in antiviral development. It emphasizes the importance of widespread screening, exploring noninvasive diagnostics, and examining current and emerging innovative therapeutic strategies. Moreover, the review explores models for monitoring treatment response. In essence, this review simplifies the complexities of effectively combating HDV.","782":"Black men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women are disproportionately affected by criminal justice involvement (CJI) and HIV. This study recruited 618 young Black MSM and transgender women in Chicago, IL, using respondent-driven sampling between 2013 and 2014. Random effects logistic regression evaluated predictors of incident CJI over 18\u00a0months of follow-up. Controlling for respondent age, gender and sexual identity, spirituality (aOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33-0.96), and presence of a mother figure (aOR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19-0.89) were protective against CJI. Economic hardship (financial or residential instability vs. neither aOR 2.23, 95% CI 1.10-4.51), two or more past episodes of CJI vs. none (aOR 2.66, 95% CI 1.40-5.66), and substance use (marijuana use vs. none aOR 2.79, 95% CI 1.23-6.34; other drug use vs. none aOR 4.49, 95% CI 1.66-12.16) were associated with CJI during follow-up. Research to identify and leverage resilience factors that can buffer the effects of socioeconomic marginalization may increase the effectiveness of interventions to address the socio-structural factors that increase the risk for CJI among Black MSM and transgender women. Given the intersection of incarceration, HIV and other STIs, and socio-structural stressors, criminal justice settings are important venues for interventions to reduce health inequities in these populations.","783":"The current pediatric vaccination program in England and Wales administers Live-Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) to children ages 2-16\u00a0years old. Annual administration of LAIV to this age group is costly and poses substantial logistical issues. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of prioritizing vaccination to age groups within the 2-16\u00a0year old age range to mitigate the operational and resource challenges of the current strategy. We performed economic evaluations comparing the influenza vaccination program from 1995-2013 to seven alternative strategies targeted at low risk individuals along the school age divisions Preschool (2-4\u00a0years old), Primary school (5-11\u00a0years old), and Secondary school (12-16\u00a0years old). These extensions are evaluated incrementally on the status quo scenario (vaccinating subgroups at high risk of influenza-related complications and individuals 65+\u00a0years old). Impact of vaccination was assessed using a transmission model from a previously published study and updated with new data. At all levels of coverage, all strategies had a 100% probability of being cost-effective at the current National Health Service threshold, \u00a320,000\/QALY gained. The incremental analysis demonstrated vaccinating Primary School children was the most cost-efficient strategy compared incrementally against others with an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio of \u00a3639 spent per QALY gained (Net Benefit: 404\u00a0M\u00a3 [155, 795]). When coverage was varied between 30%, 55%, and 70% strategies which included Primary school children had a higher probability of being cost-effective at lower willingness-to-pay levels. Although children were the vaccine target the majority of QALY gains occurred in the 25-44\u00a0years old and 65+\u00a0age groups. Influenza strain A\/H3N2 incurred the greatest costs and QALYs lost regardless of which strategy was used. Improvement could be made to the current LAIV pediatric vaccination strategy by eliminating vaccination of 2-4\u00a0year olds and focusing on school-based delivery to Primary and Secondary school children in tandem.","784":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system of unknown etiology. We tested the hypothesis that MS is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in a cohort comprising more than 10 million young adults on active duty in the US military, 955 of whom were diagnosed with MS during their period of service. Risk of MS increased 32-fold after infection with EBV but was not increased after infection with other viruses, including the similarly transmitted cytomegalovirus. Serum levels of neurofilament light chain, a biomarker of neuroaxonal degeneration, increased only after EBV seroconversion. These findings cannot be explained by any known risk factor for MS and suggest EBV as the leading cause of MS.","785":"As of February 27, 2020, 82,294 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported since December 2019, including 2,804 deaths, with cases reported throughout China, as well as in 45 international locations outside of mainland China. We predict the spatiotemporal spread of reported COVID- 19 cases at the global level during the first few weeks of the current outbreak by analyzing openly available geolocated Twitter social media data. Human mobility patterns were estimated by analyzing geolocated 2013-2015 Twitter data from users who had: i) tweeted at least twice on consecutive days from Wuhan, China, between November 1, 2013, and January 28, 2014, and November 1, 2014, and January 28, 2015; and ii) left Wuhan following their second tweet during the time period under investigation. Publicly available COVID-19 case data were used to investigate the correlation among cases reported during the current outbreak, locations visited by the study cohort of Twitter users, and airports with scheduled flights from Wuhan. Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI) data were obtained to identify the capacity of countries receiving travellers from Wuhan to respond to COVID-19. Our study cohort comprised 161 users. Of these users, 133 (82.6%) posted tweets from 157 Chinese cities (1,344 tweets) during the 30 days after leaving Wuhan following their second tweet, with a median of 2 (IQR= 1-3) locations visited and a mean distance of 601 km (IQR= 295.2-834.7 km) traveled. Of our user cohort, 60 (37.2%) traveled abroad to 119 locations in 28 countries. Of the 82 COVID-19 cases reported outside China as of January 30, 2020, 54 cases had known geolocation coordinates and 74.1% (40 cases) were reported less than 15 km (median = 7.4 km, IQR= 2.9-285.5 km) from a location visited by at least one of our study cohort's users. Countries visited by the cohort's users and which have cases reported by January 30, 2020, had a median IDVI equal to 0.74. We show that social media data can be used to predict the spatiotemporal spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Based on our analyses, we anticipate cases to be reported in Saudi Arabia and Indonesia; additionally, countries with a moderate to low IDVI (i.e. \u22640.7) such as Indonesia, Pakistan, and Turkey should be on high alert and develop COVID- 19 response plans as soon as permitting.","786":"About half of the world's population and 80% of the world's biodiversity can be found in the tropics. Many diseases are specific to the tropics, with at least 41 diseases caused by endemic bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. Such diseases are of increasing concern, as the geographic range of tropical diseases is expanding due to climate change, urbanization, change in agricultural practices, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity. While traditional medicines have been used for centuries in the treatment of tropical diseases, the active natural compounds within these medicines remain largely unknown. In this review, we describe infectious diseases specific to the tropics, including their causative pathogens, modes of transmission, recent major outbreaks, and geographic locations. We further review current treatments for these tropical diseases, carefully consider the biodiscovery potential of the tropical biome, and discuss a range of technologies being used for drug development from natural resources. We provide a list of natural products with antimicrobial activity, detailing the source organisms and their effectiveness as treatment. We discuss how technological advancements, such as next-generation sequencing, are driving high-throughput natural product screening pipelines to identify compounds with therapeutic properties. This review demonstrates the impact natural products from the vast tropical biome have in the treatment of tropical infectious diseases and how high-throughput technical capacity will accelerate this discovery process.","787":"We analyzed data from the Kala-azar Management Information System (KAMIS), using village-level VL cases over specific time intervals to predict risk in subsequent years. We also graphed the time between cases in villages and examined how these patterns track with village-level risk of additional cases across the range of cumulative village case-loads. Finally, we assessed the trade-off between ACD effort and yield.Decisions on targeting must consider the trade-off between number of villages targeted and yield and will depend upon the operational efficiencies of existing programs and the feasibility of specific ACD approaches. The maintenance of a sensitive, comprehensive VL surveillance system will be crucial to preventing future VL resurgence.In 2013, only 9.3% of all villages reported VL cases; this proportion shrank to 3.9% in 2019. Newly affected villages as a percentage of all affected villages decreased from 54.3% in 2014 to 23.5% in 2019, as more surveillance data accumulated and overall VL incidence declined. The risk of additional cases in a village increased with increasing cumulative incidence, reaching approximately 90% in villages with 12 cases and 100% in villages with 45 cases, but the vast majority of villages had small cumulative case numbers. The time-to-next-case decreased with increasing case-load. Using a 3-year window (2016-2018), a threshold of seven VL cases at the village level selects 329 villages and yields 23% of cases reported in 2019, while a threshold of three cases selects 1,241 villages and yields 46% of cases reported in 2019. Using a 6-year window increases both effort and yield.India has made major progress in improving control of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in recent years, in part through shortening the time infectious patients remain untreated. Active case detection decreases the time from VL onset to diagnosis and treatment, but requires substantial human resources. Targeting approaches are therefore essential to feasibility.","788":"In recent years, a programme of vector control, screening and treatment of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) infections led to a rapid decline in cases in the Mandoul focus of Chad. To represent the biology of transmission between humans and tsetse, we previously developed a mechanistic transmission model, fitted to data between 2000 and 2013 which suggested that transmission was interrupted by 2015. The present study outlines refinements to the model to: (1) Assess whether elimination of transmission has already been achieved despite low-level case reporting; (2) quantify the role of intensified interventions in transmission reduction; and (3) predict the trajectory of gHAT in Mandoul for the next decade under different strategies.Our previous gHAT transmission model for Mandoul was updated using human case data (2000-2019) and a series of model refinements. These include how diagnostic specificity is incorporated into the model and improvements to the fitting method (increased variance in observed case reporting and how underreporting and improvements to passive screening are captured). A side-by-side comparison of fitting to case data was performed between the models.We estimated that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015, by 2.1-fold for stage 1 detection, and 1.5-fold for stage 2. We find that whilst the diagnostic algorithm for active screening is estimated to be highly specific (95% credible interval (CI) 99.9-100%, Specificity = 99.9%), the high screening and low infection levels mean that some recently reported cases with no parasitological confirmation might be false positives. We also find that the focus-wide tsetse reduction estimated through model fitting (95% CI 96.1-99.6%, Reduction = 99.1%) is comparable to the reduction previously measured by the decline in tsetse catches from monitoring traps. In line with previous results, the model suggests that transmission was interrupted in 2015 due to intensified interventions.We recommend that additional confirmatory testing is performed in Mandoul to ensure the endgame can be carefully monitored. More specific measurement of cases, would better inform when it is safe to stop active screening and vector control, provided there is a strong passive surveillance system in place.","789":"Our analysis suggests the risk of HCP becoming infected with an endemic coronavirus increases approximately two-fold with exposures to AGP. Our findings may be relevant to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; however, SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, may differ from endemic coronaviruses in important ways.Among 4,689 HCP-seasons, we detected coronavirus infection in 387 (8%). HCP who participated in an aerosol generation procedure (AGP) at least once during the viral respiratory season were 105% (95% CI 21%, 240%) more likely to be diagnosed with a laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infection. Younger individuals, those who saw pediatric patients and those with household members under the age of five were at increased risk of coronavirus infection.SARS-CoV-2 presents a large risk to healthcare personnel. Quantifying the risk of coronavirus infection associated with workplace activities is an urgent need.We assessed the association of worker characteristics, occupational roles and behaviors, and participation in procedures with the risk of endemic coronavirus infection among healthcare personnel who participated in the Respiratory Protection Effectiveness Trial (ResPECT), a cluster randomized trial to assess personal protective equipment to prevent respiratory infections and illness conducted from 2011 to 2016.","790":"Limited dengue virus (DENV) seroprevalence estimates are available for Puerto Rico, which are needed to inform the potential use and cost-effectiveness of DENV vaccines. The Communities Organized to Prevent Arboviruses (COPA) is a cohort study initiated in 2018 in Ponce, Puerto Rico, to assess arboviral disease risk and provide a platform to evaluate interventions. We recruited participants from households in 38 study clusters, who were interviewed and provided a serum specimen. Specimens from 713 children aged 1 to 16 years during the first year of COPA were tested for the four DENV serotypes and ZIKV using a focus reduction neutralization assay. We assessed the seroprevalence of DENV and ZIKV by age and developed a catalytic model from seroprevalence and dengue surveillance data to estimate the force of infection for DENV during 2003-2018. Overall, 37% (n = 267) were seropositive for DENV; seroprevalence was 9% (11\/128) among children aged 1 to 8 years and 44% (256\/585) among children aged 9 to 16 years, exceeding the threshold over which DENV vaccination is deemed cost-effective. A total of 33% were seropositive for ZIKV, including 15% among children aged 0 to 8 years and 37% among children aged 9 to 16 years. The highest force of infection occurred in 2007, 2010, and 2012-2013, with low levels of transmission from 2016 to 2018. A higher proportion of children had evidence of multitypic DENV infection than expected, suggesting high heterogeneity in DENV risk in this setting.","791":"The word 'medicine' is typically associated with humans, but scientists are increasingly realizing that non-human animals also use medication to deal with infections and other health issues. Medication behaviors are shared by a wide diversity of animal species, ranging from ants to apes, from bees to bears, and from caterpillars to capuchins. These animals use a wide variety of medicines provided by nature, ranging from plant chemicals to other animals and clay (Box 1). The targets of medication are equally diverse: while many animals use medication as protection against internal and external parasites and pathogens, animals may also use medicine to reduce inflammation and stress or to improve reproductive function.","792":"Tuberculosis control and elimination remains a challenge for public health even in low-burden countries. New technology and novel approaches to case-finding, diagnosis, and treatment are causes for optimism but they need to be used cost-effectively. This in turn requires improved understanding of the epidemiology of TB and analysis of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different interventions. We describe the contribution that mathematical modeling can make to understanding epidemiology and control of TB in different groups, guiding improved approaches to public health interventions. We emphasize that modeling is not a substitute for collecting data but rather is complementary to empirical research, helping determine what are the key questions to address to maximize the public-health impact of research, helping to plan studies, and making maximal use of available data, particularly from surveillance, and observational studies. We provide examples of how modeling and related empirical research inform policy and discuss how a combination of these approaches can be used to address current questions of key importance, including use of whole-genome sequencing, screening and treatment for latent infection, and combating drug resistance. ","793":"Due to the high cost of treatment, preventative measures to limit Hepatitis C (HCV) transmission among people who inject drugs (PWID) are encouraged by many public health officials. A key one of these is serosorting, where PWID select risk partners based on concordant HCV status. Research on the general U.S. population by Smith et al. (2013) found that knowledge of one's own HCV status facilitated serosorting behaviors among PWID, such that respondents with knowledge of their own status were more likely to ask potential partners about their status prior to sharing risk. Our objective was to see if this held true in rural Puerto Rico. We replicate this study using a sample of PWID in rural Puerto Rico to draw comparisons. We used respondent driven sampling to survey 315 participants, and have a final analytic sample of 154. The survey was heavily modeled after the National HIV Behavioral Survey, which was the dataset used by the previous researchers. We found that among PWID in rural Puerto Rico, unlike in the general population, knowledge of one's own HCV status had no significant effect on the selection of one's most recent injection partner, based on his\/her HCV status. We conclude that PWID in rural Puerto Rico differ from the general U.S. population when it comes to serosorting behaviors, and that these differences should be taken into account in future outreaches and intervention strategies.","794":"The impact of the drastic reduction in travel volume within mainland China in January and February 2020 was quantified with respect to reports of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections outside China. Data on confirmed cases diagnosed outside China were analyzed using statistical models to estimate the impact of travel reduction on three epidemiological outcome measures: (i) the number of exported cases, (ii) the probability of a major epidemic, and (iii) the time delay to a major epidemic. From 28 January to 7 February 2020, we estimated that 226 exported cases (95% confidence interval: 86,449) were prevented, corresponding to a 70.4% reduction in incidence compared to the counterfactual scenario. The reduced probability of a major epidemic ranged from 7% to 20% in Japan, which resulted in a median time delay to a major epidemic of two days. Depending on the scenario, the estimated delay may be less than one day. As the delay is small, the decision to control travel volume through restrictions on freedom of movement should be balanced between the resulting estimated epidemiological impact and predicted economic fallout.","795":"Current estimates of COVID-19 prevalence are largely based on symptomatic, clinically diagnosed cases. The existence of a large number of undiagnosed infections hampers population-wide investigation of viral circulation. Here, we quantify the SARS-CoV-2 concentration and track its dynamics in wastewater at a major urban wastewater treatment facility in Massachusetts, between early January and May 2020. SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in wastewater on March 3. SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater correlated with clinically diagnosed new COVID-19 cases, with the trends appearing 4-10\u00a0days earlier in wastewater than in clinical data. We inferred viral shedding dynamics by modeling wastewater viral load as a convolution of back-dated new clinical cases with the average population-level viral shedding function. The inferred viral shedding function showed an early peak, likely before symptom onset and clinical diagnosis, consistent with emerging clinical and experimental evidence. This finding suggests that SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater may be primarily driven by viral shedding early in infection. This work shows that longitudinal wastewater analysis can be used to identify trends in disease transmission in advance of clinical case reporting, and infer early viral shedding dynamics for newly infected individuals, which are difficult to capture in clinical investigations.","796":"Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2005-2014) for all patients undergoing spinal fusion \u226426 years of age, we compared the following factors: demographics, comorbidities, and perioperative variables (e.g., between NF1 vs. non-NF1, and between NF1 and propensity score (PS)-matched non- NF1 spinal fusion patients) using univariate hypothesis tests and multivariate regression analyses. Our main interest focused on length of stay, complication rates, adverse postoperative events, and incidence of nonroutine discharges. > 0.05). In PS-matched multivariate analyses, NF1-status was not a significant independent predictor of length of stay or nonroutine discharge disposition.NF1-status was, therefore, not an independent predictor of complications, adverse postoperative events, longer LOS, or nonroutine hospital discharge in this cohort analysis. Further prospective studies are necessary to understand how outcomes in patients with NF1 compare to non-NF1 pediatric and young adult patients.Although spinal deformities are common in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), there is a paucity of data as to how this impacts outcomes of spinal fusion surgery in pediatric\/young adult patients.","797":"Our ability to forecast epidemics far into the future is constrained by the many complexities of disease systems. Realistic longer-term projections may, however, be possible under well-defined scenarios that specify the future state of critical epidemic drivers. Since December 2020, the U.S. COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub (SMH) has convened multiple modeling teams to make months ahead projections of SARS-CoV-2 burden, totaling nearly 1.8 million national and state-level projections. Here, we find SMH performance varied widely as a function of both scenario validity and model calibration. We show scenarios remained close to reality for 22 weeks on average before the arrival of unanticipated SARS-CoV-2 variants invalidated key assumptions. An ensemble of participating models that preserved variation between models (using the linear opinion pool method) was consistently more reliable than any single model in periods of valid scenario assumptions, while projection interval coverage was near target levels. SMH projections were used to guide pandemic response, illustrating the value of collaborative hubs for longer-term scenario projections.","798":"We leveraged spatially-referenced data from 21 states collated through the COVID Neighborhood Project to examine the distribution of COVID-19 cases across neighborhoods and states in the U.S. We also linked the COVID-19 case data with data on the neighborhood social environment from the National Neighborhood Data Archive. We then estimated correlations between neighborhood COVID-19 burden and features of the neighborhood social environment.We find that the distribution of COVID-19 at the neighborhood-level varies within and between states. The median case count per neighborhood (coefficient of variation (CV)) in Wisconsin is 3078.52 (0.17) per 10,000 population, indicating a more homogenous distribution of COVID-19 burden, whereas in Vermont the median case count per neighborhood (CV) is 810.98 (0.84) per 10,000\u00a0population. We also find that correlations between features of the neighborhood social environment and burden vary in magnitude and direction by state.Our findings underscore the importance that local contexts may play when addressing the long-term social and economic fallout communities will face from COVID-19.A lack of fine, spatially-resolute case data for the U.S. has prevented the examination of how COVID-19 infection burden has been distributed across neighborhoods, a key determinant of both risk and resilience. Without more spatially resolute data, efforts to identify and mitigate the long-term fallout from COVID-19 in vulnerable communities will remain difficult to quantify and intervene on.","799":" = 328 listeners). Average intelligibility scores for single-word productions and multiword productions were modeled using linear regression, which estimated normal-model quantile age trajectories for single- and multiword utterances.

Results showed that boys did not differ from girls and that, prior to 35 months of age, single words were more intelligible than multiword productions. Starting at 41 months of age, the reverse was true. Multiword intelligibility grew at a faster rate than single-word intelligibility. Conclusions Children make steady progress in intelligibility development through 47 months, and only a small number of children approach 100% intelligibility by this age. Intelligibility continues to develop past the fourth year of life. There is considerable variability among children with regard to intelligibility development.

We sought to examine how language of survey completion (English or Spanish) was associated with sociodemographic characteristics and indicators of HIV risk and prevention among cisgender Latino sexual minority men (SMM). We analyzed national and Washington State data using the Understanding New Infections through Targeted Epidemiology (UNITE) Cohort Study (2017 and 2018) and the Washington HIV\/STI Prevention Project (WHSPP) survey (2017 and 2018\/2019), respectively. Latino SMM who completed online surveys in Spanish differed from those who completed surveys in English across several sociodemographic characteristics including age, education, and income. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and HIV-related risk factors, Spanish language respondents in UNITE were less likely to have tested for HIV in the past year, and those in WHSPP were more likely to report a recent STI diagnosis. Findings suggest that Latino SMM who complete surveys in Spanish comprise a unique subgroup that may have a specific HIV health and risk behavior profile. Our results suggest a need for increased and tailored efforts to recruit and include Spanish-speaking Latino SMM for local and national research and public health programming.","801":" values between 0.33 and 0.60. Temperature, temperature range, rainfall and population size were the most important predictors of where Zika transmission occurred, while rainfall, relative humidity and a nonlinear effect of temperature were the best predictors of Zika intensity and burden. Surprisingly, force of infection was greatest in locations with temperatures near 24\u00b0C, much lower than previous estimates from mechanistic models, potentially suggesting that existing vector control programmes and\/or prior exposure to other mosquito-borne diseases may have limited transmission in locations most suitable for Aedes aegypti, the main vector of Zika, dengue and chikungunya viruses in Latin America.","802":"It has recently been proposed that lower mutation rates in gene bodies compared with upstream and downstream sequences in Arabidopsis thaliana are the result of an \"adaptive\" modification of the rate of beneficial and deleterious mutations in these functional regions. This claim was based both on analyses of mutation accumulation lines and on population genomics data. Here, we show that several questionable assumptions were used in the population genomics analyses. In particular, we demonstrate that the difference between gene bodies and less selectively constrained sequences in the magnitude of Tajima's D can in principle be explained by the presence of sites subject to purifying selection and does not require lower mutation rates in regions experiencing selective constraints.","803":"Characterizing the genetic diversity of pathogens within the host promises to greatly improve surveillance and reconstruction of transmission chains. For bacteria, it also informs our understanding of inter-strain competition and how this shapes the distribution of resistant and sensitive bacteria. Here we study the genetic diversity of Streptococcus pneumoniae within 468 infants and 145 of their mothers by deep sequencing whole pneumococcal populations from 3,761 longitudinal nasopharyngeal samples. We demonstrate that deep sequencing has unsurpassed sensitivity for detecting multiple colonization, doubling the rate at which highly invasive serotype 1 bacteria were detected in carriage compared with gold-standard methods. The greater resolution identified an elevated rate of transmission from mothers to their children in the first year of the child's life. Comprehensive treatment data demonstrated that infants were at an elevated risk of both the acquisition and persistent colonization of a multidrug-resistant bacterium following antimicrobial treatment. Some alleles were enriched after antimicrobial treatment, suggesting that they aided persistence, but generally purifying selection dominated within-host evolution. Rates of co-colonization imply that in the absence of treatment, susceptible lineages outcompeted resistant lineages within the host. These results demonstrate the many benefits of deep sequencing for the genomic surveillance of bacterial pathogens.","804":"Zika virus has emerged in the Americas, where dengue virus is endemic. Among the 4 serotypes of dengue virus, antibody-dependent enhancement is thought to enhance viral replication and disease severity. Reports suggest that anti-dengue virus antibody may enhance Zika virus replication. We investigated whether Zika virus antibodies enhance dengue virus replication, by exposing C57Bl\/6 mice to Zika virus. Polyclonal serum was verified for strong Zika virus-neutralizing, dengue virus-subneutralizing capacity. Then we determined the enhancement capabilities of Zika virus-immune serum for dengue virus in vitro. We showed that Zika virus antibodies have the ability to enhance dengue virus infections, which is important, because in many Zika virus-affected areas, dengue virus is expected to remain endemic.","805":"Pakistan's national tuberculosis control programme (NTP) is among the many programmes worldwide that value the importance of subnational tuberculosis (TB) burden estimates to support disease control efforts, but do not have reliable estimates. A hackathon was thus organised to solicit the development and comparison of several models for small area estimation of TB. The TB hackathon was launched in April 2019. Participating teams were requested to produce district-level estimates of bacteriologically positive TB prevalence among adults (over 15 years of age) for 2018. The NTP provided case-based data from their 2010-2011 TB prevalence survey, along with data relating to TB screening, testing and treatment for the period between 2010-2011 and 2018. Five teams submitted district-level TB prevalence estimates, methodological details and programming code. Although the geographical distribution of TB prevalence varied considerably across models, we identified several districts with consistently low notification-to-prevalence ratios. The hackathon highlighted the challenges of generating granular spatiotemporal TB prevalence forecasts based on a cross-sectional prevalence survey data and other data sources. Nevertheless, it provided a range of approaches to subnational disease modelling. The NTP's use and plans for these outputs shows that, limitations notwithstanding, they can be valuable for programme planning.","806":"Influenza incidence forecasting is used to facilitate better health system planning and could potentially be used to allow at-risk individuals to modify their behavior during a severe seasonal influenza epidemic or a novel respiratory pandemic. For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) runs an annual competition to forecast influenza-like illness (ILI) at the regional and national levels in the US, based on a standard discretized incidence scale. Here, we use a suite of forecasting models to analyze type-specific incidence at the smaller spatial scale of clusters of nearby counties. We used data from point-of-care (POC) diagnostic machines over three seasons, in 10 clusters, capturing: 57 counties; 1,061,891 total specimens; and 173,909 specimens positive for Influenza A. Total specimens were closely correlated with comparable CDC ILI data. Mechanistic models were substantially more accurate when forecasting influenza A positive POC data than total specimen POC data, especially at longer lead times. Also, models that fit subpopulations of the cluster (individual counties) separately were better able to forecast clusters than were models that directly fit to aggregated cluster data. Public health authorities may wish to consider developing forecasting pipelines for type-specific POC data in addition to ILI data. Simple mechanistic models will likely improve forecast accuracy when applied at small spatial scales to pathogen-specific data before being scaled to larger geographical units and broader syndromic data. Highly local forecasts may enable new public health messaging to encourage at-risk individuals to temporarily reduce their social mixing during seasonal peaks and guide public health intervention policy during potentially severe novel influenza pandemics.","807":"Simulation experiments revealed that maintaining face mask use (at the coverage seen in the USA from March, 2020, to July, 2020) until target vaccination coverages were achieved was cost-effective and in many cases cost saving from both the societal and third-party payer perspectives across nearly all scenarios explored. Face mask use was estimated to be cost-effective and usually cost saving when the cost of face masks per person per day was \u2264US$1\u00b725. In all scenarios, it was estimated to be cost-effective to maintain face mask use for about 2-10 weeks beyond the date that target vaccination coverage (70-90%) was achieved, with this added duration being longer when the target coverage was achieved during winter versus summer. Factors that might increase the transmissibility of the virus (eg, emergence of the delta [B.1.617.2] and omicron [B.1.1.529] variants), or decrease vaccine effectiveness (eg, waning immunity or escape variants), or increase social interactions among certain segments of the population, only increased the cost savings or cost-effectiveness provided by maintaining face mask use.Our study provides strong support for maintaining face mask use until and a short time after achieving various final vaccination coverage levels, given that maintaining face mask use can be not just cost-effective, but even cost saving. The emergence of the omicron variant and the prospect of future variants that might be more transmissible and reduce vaccine effectiveness only increases the value of face masks.In this computational simulation-model study, we developed and used a Monte Carlo simulation model representing the US population and SARS-CoV-2 spread. Simulation experiments compared what would happen if face masks were used versus not used until given final vaccination coverages were achieved. Different scenarios varied the target vaccination coverage (70-90%), the date these coverages were achieved (Jan 1, 2022, to July 1, 2022), and the date the population discontinued wearing face masks.The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the National Science Foundation, the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, and the City University of New York.Face mask wearing has been an important part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As vaccination coverage progresses in countries, relaxation of such practices is increasing. Subsequent COVID-19 surges have raised the questions of whether face masks should be encouraged or required and for how long. Here, we aim to assess the value of maintaining face masks use indoors according to different COVID-19 vaccination coverage levels in the USA.","808":"We provide a methodology for estimating counts of single-year-of-age live-births, fetal-losses, abortions, and pregnant women from aggregated age-group counts. As a case study, we estimate counts for the 254 counties of Texas for the year 2010.We use interpolation to estimate counts of live-births, fetal-losses, and abortions by women of each single-year-of-age for all Texas counties. We then use these counts to estimate the numbers of pregnant women for each single-year-of-age, which were previously available only in aggregate. To support public health policy and planning, we provide single-year-of-age estimates of live-births, fetal-losses, abortions, and pregnant women for all Texas counties in the year 2010, as well as the estimation method source code.","809":"The winter influenza season 2019\/20 in Hong Kong was predominated by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. We analysed an on-going test-negative design study consisting of 1227 children admitted for febrile acute respiratory illness from 3 November 2019 (week 45) to 21 March 2020 (week 12). We estimated influenza vaccine effectiveness of 65% (95% CI: 46 - 78) against hospitalization due to influenza A and B combined, and 74% (95% CI: 54 - 85) against hospitalization due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.","810":"Determining whether SARS-CoV-2 exhibits seasonality like other respiratory viruses is critical for public health planning. We evaluated whether COVID-19 rates follow a seasonal pattern using time series models. We used time series decomposition to extract the annual seasonal component of COVID-19 case, hospitalization, and mortality rates from March 2020 through December 2022 for the United States and Europe. Models were adjusted for a country-specific stringency index to account for confounding by various interventions. Despite year-round disease activity, we identified seasonal spikes in COVID-19 from approximately November through April for all outcomes and in all countries. Our results support employing annual preventative measures against SARS-CoV-2, such as administering seasonal booster vaccines in a similar timeframe as those in place for influenza. Whether certain high-risk individuals may need more than one COVID-19 vaccine booster dose each year will depend on factors like vaccine durability against severe illness and levels of year-round disease activity.","811":"Placental invasiveness-the number of maternal tissue layers separating fetal tissues from maternal blood-is variable across mammalian species. Although this diversity is likely to be functionally important, variation in placental invasiveness remains unexplained. Here we test the hypothesis that increased risk of transplacental transmission of pathogens from the mother to the fetus promotes the evolution of non-invasive placentation, the most likely derived condition in eutherian mammals. Specifically, we predict that non-invasive placentation is associated with increased microparasite species richness relative to more invasive placental types, based on the assumption that higher numbers of microparasites in a population reflects greater risk of transplacental transmission to fetuses. As predicted, higher bacteria species richness is associated with non-invasive placentation. Protozoa species richness, however, shows the opposite pattern. Because invasive placentae facilitate the transfer of maternal antibodies to the fetus, we propose that the ancestral condition of invasive placentation is retained under selection for protection of newborns from higher risk of postnatal protozoan infection. Hence, our findings suggest that a tradeoff exists between protection against bacterial infection prenatally and protozoan infection postnatally. Future studies are needed to investigate how maternal prevalence of infection and the relative pre- versus postnatal risk of fetal infection by different microparasite groups vary among mammalian hosts in relation to placental invasiveness. ","812":"While digital trace data from sources like search engines hold enormous potential for tracking and understanding human behavior, these streams of data lack information about the actual experiences of those individuals generating the data. Moreover, most current methods ignore or under-utilize human processing capabilities that allow humans to solve problems not yet solvable by computers (human computation). We demonstrate how behavioral research, linking digital and real-world behavior, along with human computation, can be utilized to improve the performance of studies using digital data streams. This study looks at the use of search data to track prevalence of Influenza-Like Illness (ILI). We build a behavioral model of flu search based on survey data linked to users' online browsing data. We then utilize human computation for classifying search strings. Leveraging these resources, we construct a tracking model of ILI prevalence that outperforms strong historical benchmarks using only a limited stream of search data and lends itself to tracking ILI in smaller geographic units. While this paper only addresses searches related to ILI, the method we describe has potential for tracking a broad set of phenomena in near real-time.","813":"Evidence for interactions between populations plays a prominent role in the reconstruction of historical and prehistoric human dynamics; these interactions are usually interpreted to reflect cultural practices or demographic processes. The sharp increase in long-distance transportation of lithic material between the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic, for example, is seen as a manifestation of the cultural revolution that defined the transition between these epochs. Here, we propose that population interaction is not only a reflection of cultural change but also a potential driver of it. We explore the possible effects of inter-population migration on cultural evolution when migrating individuals possess core technological knowledge from their original population. Using a computational framework of cultural evolution that incorporates realistic aspects of human innovation processes, we show that migration can lead to a range of outcomes, including punctuated but transient increases in cultural complexity, an increase of cultural complexity to an elevated steady state and the emergence of a positive feedback loop that drives ongoing acceleration in cultural accumulation. Our findings suggest that population contact may have played a crucial role in the evolution of hominin cultures and propose explanations for observations of Palaeolithic cultural change whose interpretations have been hotly debated.","814":"Chatbots have become an increasingly popular tool in the field of health services and communications. Despite chatbots' significance amid the COVID-19 pandemic, few studies have performed a rigorous evaluation of the effectiveness of chatbots in improving vaccine confidence and acceptance. In Thailand, Hong Kong, and Singapore, from February 11th to June 30th, 2022, we conducted multisite randomised controlled trials (RCT) on 2,045 adult guardians of children and seniors who were unvaccinated or had delayed vaccinations. After a week of using COVID-19 vaccine chatbots, the differences in vaccine confidence and acceptance were compared between the intervention and control groups. Compared to non-users, fewer chatbot users reported decreased confidence in vaccine effectiveness in the Thailand child group [Intervention: 4.3 % vs. Control: 17%, P\u2009=\u20090.023]. However, more chatbot users reported decreased vaccine acceptance [26% vs. 12%, P\u2009=\u20090.028] in Hong Kong child group and decreased vaccine confidence in safety [29% vs. 10%, P\u2009=\u20090.041] in Singapore child group. There was no statistically significant change in vaccine confidence or acceptance in the Hong Kong senior group. Employing the RE-AIM framework, process evaluation indicated strong acceptance and implementation support for vaccine chatbots from stakeholders, with high levels of sustainability and scalability. This multisite, parallel RCT study on vaccine chatbots found mixed success in improving vaccine confidence and acceptance among unvaccinated Asian subpopulations. Further studies that link chatbot usage and real-world vaccine uptake are needed to augment evidence for employing vaccine chatbots to advance vaccine confidence and acceptance.","815":"Vaccination irrespective of HIV status, with a vaccine with equal efficacy and duration in PLHIV, could avert up to 1.01 (95% range: 0.96-1.22) million TB cases in PLHIV. Restricting vaccination to PLHIV or people without HIV would achieve 65% (60-70) and 48% (46-53) of the total impact respectively. These results are strongly dependent on the assumed efficacy and duration of protection in PLHIV. Further information on these characteristics is important to identify the most efficient use of new vaccines to reduce TB burden in PLHIV.Our results suggest that new vaccines could play an important role in reducing the TB burden in PLHIV. Vaccines targeted at people without HIV individuals could provide significant indirect benefit to PLHIV, but vaccines which are safe and effective in PLHIV will be critical to maximizing the impact in this population.People living with HIV (PLHIV) are at increased risk of tuberculosis (TB). New TB vaccines may help reduce this burden. New TB vaccine candidates are safe and immunogenic in PLHIV.There is currently limited data on vaccine efficacy in this population.Using mathematical modelling we explored the potential impact of a novel TB vaccine on TB burden in PLHIV in South Africa between 2030-2050. We compared the impact of a vaccine delivered irrespective of HIV status to vaccination of either PLHIV or people without HIV. We explored the impact of reduced vaccine efficacy and duration of protection in PLHIV relative to people without HIV on our model predictions.","816":"Despite a high prevalence of injection drug use (IDU) in Puerto Rico, little is known about how it affects neuropsychological functioning in this population. Investigations of intra-individual variability (IIV) have alluded to its utility as a potential indicator of neural decline. The purpose of this study was to characterize IIV among Hispanic residents of Puerto Rico who engage in IDU. Injectors and non-injectors completed the Neurops\u00ed Atenci\u00f3n y Memoria battery. Measures of IIV were calculated for the overall test battery (OTB), the three battery indices, and three domains of attention, memory, and executive functioning. The injector group showed significantly greater IIV than the non-injector group on all measures (OTB, indices, and individual domains). Additionally, injectors showed significantly higher IIV in the domain of executive functioning compared to other cognitive domains and battery indices. In contrast, non-injectors did not show any significant within-group differences on any IIV measures. The higher performance variability observed in the IDU group suggests a negative influence of IDU on cognition, with executive functioning being more susceptible to these effects. These findings support the need for continued investigations into the clinical application of IIV for diagnostic and prognostic purposes in the Hispanic IDU population.","817":"Natural killer (NK) cells mediate innate host defense against microbial infection and cancer. Hypoxia and low glucose are characteristic for these tissue lesions but do not affect early interferon (IFN) \u03b3 and CC chemokine release by interleukin 15 (IL-15) primed human NK cells in vitro. Hypoxia inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) mediates cellular adaption to hypoxia. Its production is supported by mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). We used chemical inhibition to probe the importance of mTORC1 and STAT3 for the hypoxia response and of STAT3 for the cytokine response in isolated and IL-15 primed human NK cells. Cellular responses were assayed by magnetic bead array, RT-PCR, western blotting, flow cytometry, and metabolic flux analysis. STAT3 but not mTORC1 activation was essential for HIF-1\u03b1 accumulation, glycolysis, and oxygen consumption. In both primed normoxic and hypoxic NK cells, STAT3 inhibition reduced the secretion of CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5, and it interfered with IL-12\/IL-18 stimulated IFN\u03b3 production, but it did not affect cytotoxic granule degranulation up on target cell contact. We conclude that IL-15 priming promotes the HIF-1\u03b1 dependent hypoxia response and the early cytokine response in NK cells predominantly through STAT3 signaling.","818":"Prostate cancer is a common cancer among males in the US, but little is known about its risk factors, including trace elements. The primary aim of this study was to examine prostate cancer and its association with arsenic and selenium in toenails. We conducted a small, nested case-control study of men residing in Iowa within the Agricultural Health Study cohort, where we also collected toenail samples to test for arsenic and other trace elements. Toenail samples were sent for neutron activation analysis aimed at long-lived trace elements, including arsenic. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for trace element exposures and prostate cancer. A total of 66 prostate cancer cases and 173 healthy controls returned questionnaires, over 99% of which included toenail samples. An increased risk was seen for the highest levels of arsenic (OR = 3.4 confidence interval (CI) of 1.3-8.6 and OR = 2.2, 95% CI of 0.9-5.6) and the highest level of selenium (2.0, 95% CI of 1.0-4.0). These data also show detectable levels of over 50% for 14 of 22 elements detected in the toenails. The association seen here with arsenic and prostate cancer further supports ecological studies finding an association with community levels of arsenic and prostate cancer incidence and mortality.","819":"A total of 362 children (58% male and 72% White) were reviewed; 41% (n\u2009=\u2009150) weaned from PN at age 1.5 years (IQR\u2009=\u20090.96-3). Weight and length\/height data were available for 144 children; 46 received an intestinal transplant. Median weight and length\/height z scores at weaning were -1.15 (IQR\u2009=\u2009-2.09 to -0.39) and -1.89 (IQR\u2009=\u2009-2.9 to -1.02), respectively. In those not transplanted, z scores remained stable (\u00b1 0.5 change). Children with small bowel atresia experienced accelerated linear growth (> +0.5 change) beginning in year 3. Most children transplanted experienced growth acceleration beginning in year 2. Fourteen children received teduglutide (median\u2009=\u2009840 [IQR\u2009=\u2009425-1530] days), and growth remained stable throughout treatment. Five were weaned from PN within 1 year.Growth outcomes in children with intestinal failure (IF) after weaning from parenteral nutrition (PN) may be modified by primary diagnosis and interventions aimed at achieving enteral tolerance. We evaluated growth after weaning by diagnosis and intestinal transplant status and during treatment with the glucagon-like peptide-2 analog teduglutide.A two-center retrospective review was conducted on children diagnosed with IF at age 6 months. Data were reported as median and interquartile range (IQR).We observed stable growth with limited catch-up after PN weaning, with minimal variation by diagnosis, and during teduglutide therapy. Children who received an intestinal transplant experienced acceleration in weight and linear growth after weaning.","820":"Multiple COVID-19 vaccines were proven to be safe and effective in curbing severe illness, but despite vaccine availability, vaccination rates were relatively low in the United States (U.S.). To better understand factors associated with low COVID-19 vaccine uptake in the U.S., our study provides a comprehensive, data-driven population-level statistical analysis at the county level. We find that political affiliation, as determined by the proportion of votes received by the Republican candidate in the 2020 presidential election, has the strongest association with our response variable, the percent of the population that received no COVID-19 vaccine. The next strongest association was median household income, which has a negative association. The percentage of Black people and the average number of vehicles per household are positively associated with the percent unvaccinated. In contrast, COVID-19 infection rate, percentage of Latinx people, postsecondary education percentage, median age, and prior non-COVID-19 childhood vaccination coverage are negatively associated with percent unvaccinated. Unlike previous studies, we do not find significant relationships between cable TV news viewership or Twitter misinformation variables with COVID-19 vaccine uptake. These results shed light on some factors that may impact vaccination choice in the U.S. and can be used to target specific populations for educational outreach and vaccine campaign strategies in efforts to increase vaccination uptake.","821":"Species invasions and range shifts can lead to novel host-parasite communities, but we lack general rules on which new associations are likely to form. While many studies examine parasite sharing among host species, the directionality of transmission is typically overlooked, impeding our ability to derive principles of parasite acquisition. Consequently, we analysed parasite records from the non-native ranges of 11 carnivore and ungulate species. Using boosted regression trees, we modelled parasite acquisition within each zoogeographic realm of a focal host's non-native range, using a suite of predictors characterizing the parasites themselves and the host community in which they live. We found that higher parasite prevalence among established hosts increases the likelihood of acquisition, particularly for generalist parasites. Non-native host species are also more likely to acquire parasites from established host species to which they are closely related; however, the acquisition of several parasite groups is biased to phylogenetically specialist parasites, indicating potential costs of parasite generalism. Statistical models incorporating these features provide an accurate prediction of parasite acquisition, indicating that measurable host and parasite traits can be used to estimate the likelihood of new host-parasite associations forming. This work provides general rules to help anticipate novel host-parasite associations created by climate change and other anthropogenic influences.","822":"Introduction of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the United States was not associated with a significant change in prevalence of penicillin resistance in nonvaccine type serotypes because of the variable success of highly resistant serotypes. Differences in regional serotype distribution and serotype-specific resistance contributed to geographic heterogeneity of penicillin resistance.","823":" incidence per month, respectively, in Cluster II. The decreasing trends reflect the achievements of malaria control efforts on both sides of the Thai-Myanmar border. However, these clusters could act as reservoirs. Perhaps one of the main challenges facing elimination programs in this low transmission setting is maintaining a strong system for early diagnosis and treatment, even when malaria cases are very close to zero, whilst preventing re-importation of cases.","824":"This 2-arm, randomized controlled trial will enroll young men who have sex with men (YMSM) aged between 18 and 24 years from rural areas of Georgia, Mississippi, and North Carolina. The trial will seek to recruit a diverse sample, targeting 50% participation among highly impacted groups of black or Latino men who have sex with men. Intervention participants will receive a study app that incorporates a messaging platform, a scheduling and milestone-based tracking system for PrEP care progress, electronic behavioral surveys, and interactive video consultations with a clinician. Complemented by SSC kits mailed to laboratories for standard PrEP-related monitoring, the ePrEP system will allow participants to access PrEP care without leaving their homes. YMSM randomized to the control condition will receive a listing of nearest local PrEP providers to receive standard PrEP care. Both groups will complete quarterly electronic surveys. The primary outcome, assessed at 6 and 12 months after randomization, will be the difference in the proportion of intervention versus control participants that achieve protective levels of the active metabolite of oral PrEP (tenofovir diphosphate in dried blood spots).Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly efficacious for preventing HIV but has not yet been brought to scale among at-risk persons. In several clinical trials in urban areas, technology-based interventions have shown a positive impact on PrEP adherence. In rural and small-town areas in the United States, which often do not have geographically proximal access to PrEP providers, additional support may be needed. This may be particularly true for younger persons who are more likely to face multiple barriers to accessing PrEP services. Home-based care, accomplished through a tailored mobile phone app, specimen self-collection (SSC), and interactive video consultations, could increase both PrEP initiation and persistence in care.Enrollment will begin in May 2019, with study completion in 2022.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03729570; https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT03729570 (Archived by WebCite at http:\/\/www.webcitation.org\/78RE2Qizf).PRR1-10.2196\/13982.The goal of this study is to assess the initiation and persistence in PrEP care for those randomized to a home-care intervention (electronic PrEP, ePrEP) relative to those assigned to the standard of care (control) condition. We will conduct additional assessments, including quantitative and qualitative analyses, to contextualize trial results and facilitate scale-up.This trial will determine whether home PrEP care provided through an app-based platform is an efficacious means of expanding access to PrEP care for a diverse group of YMSM in rural and small-town areas of the United States.","825":"The basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] is a fundamental concept in mathematical epidemiology and infectious disease modeling. Loosely speaking, it describes the number of people that an infectious person is expected to infect. The basic reproduction number has profound implications for epidemic trajectories and disease control strategies. It is well known that the basic reproduction number can be calculated as the spectral radius of the next generation matrix, but why this is the case may not be intuitively obvious. Here, we walk through how the discrete, next generation process connects to the ordinary differential equation disease system of interest, linearized at the disease-free equilibrium. Then, we use linear algebra to develop a geometric explanation of why the spectral radius of the next generation matrix is an epidemic threshold. Finally, we work through a series of examples that help to build familiarity with the kinds of patterns that arise in parameter combinations produced by the next generation method. This article is intended to help new infectious disease modelers develop intuition for the form and interpretation of the basic reproduction number in their disease systems of interest.","826":"The malaria surveillance and response system in Lao PDR has played a crucial role in reducing transmission and advancing the country towards elimination. Challenges such as importation, drug resistance, and sustaining support require ongoing efforts. Further strengthening surveillance, improving access to services, and addressing transmission determinants are key areas of focus to achieve malaria elimination and enhance population health in Lao PDR.Data on surveillance, monitoring and evaluation systems, human resources, infrastructure, and community malaria knowledge during 2010-2020 were systematically gathered from the national program and relevant documents. The collected information was synthesized, and discussions on challenges and future prospects were provided.Lao PDR has made significant progress in malaria control. The National Strategic Plans outline ambitious targets, aiming for the elimination of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax malaria from all northern provinces by 2025 and national elimination by 2030. This article presents an overview of malaria epidemiology, surveillance, and response systems in Lao PDR, emphasizing experiences and achievements in transmission reduction.Malaria control and elimination activities in Lao PDR were implemented at various levels, with a focus on health facility catchment areas. There has been significant progress in reducing malaria transmission throughout the country. Targeted interventions, such as case management, vector control, and community engagement, using stratification of control interventions by catchment areas have contributed to the decline in malaria cases. In elimination areas, active surveillance strategies, including case and foci investigation, are implemented to identify and stop transmission. The surveillance system has facilitated timely detection and response to malaria cases, enabling these targeted interventions in higher-risk areas.","827":"Viral recombination can generate novel genotypes with unique phenotypic characteristics, including transmissibility and virulence. Although the capacity for recombination among betacoronaviruses is well documented, recombination between strains of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has not been characterized in detail. Here, we present a lightweight approach for detecting genomes that are potentially recombinant. This approach relies on identifying the mutations that primarily determine SARS-CoV-2 clade structure and then screening genomes for ones that contain multiple mutational markers from distinct clades. Among the over 537,000 genomes queried that were deposited on GISAID.org prior to 16 February 2021, we detected 1,175 potential recombinant sequences. Using a highly conservative criteria to exclude sequences that may have originated through de novo mutation, we find that at least 30\u2009per cent (n\u2009=\u2009358) are likely of recombinant origin. An analysis of deep-sequencing data for these putative recombinants, where available, indicated that the majority are high quality. Additional phylogenetic analysis and the observed co-circulation of predicted parent clades in the geographic regions of exposure further support the feasibility of recombination in this subset of potential recombinants. An analysis of these genomes did not reveal evidence for recombination hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. While most of the putative recombinant sequences we detected were genetic singletons, a small number of genetically identical or highly similar recombinant sequences were identified in the same geographic region, indicative of locally circulating lineages. Recombinant genomes were also found to have originated from parental lineages with substitutions of concern, including D614G, N501Y, E484K, and L452R. Adjusting for an unequal probability of detecting recombinants derived from different parent clades and for geographic variation in clade abundance, we estimate that at most 0.2-2.5\u2009per cent of circulating viruses in the USA and UK are recombinant. Our identification of a small number of putative recombinants within the first year of SARS-CoV-2 circulation underscores the need to sustain efforts to monitor the emergence of new genotypes generated through recombination.","828":"The unprecedented scale of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa has, as of 29 April 2015, resulted in more than 10,884 deaths among 26,277 cases. Prior to the ongoing outbreak, Ebola virus disease (EVD) caused relatively small outbreaks (maximum outbreak size 425 in Gulu, Uganda) in isolated populations in central Africa. Here, we have compiled a comprehensive database of estimates of epidemiological parameters based on data from past outbreaks, including the incubation period distribution, case fatality rate, basic reproduction number (R 0 ), effective reproduction number (R t ) and delay distributions. We have compared these to parameter estimates from the ongoing outbreak in West Africa. The ongoing outbreak, because of its size, provides a unique opportunity to better understand transmission patterns of EVD. We have not performed a meta-analysis of the data, but rather summarize the estimates by virus from comprehensive investigations of EVD and Marburg outbreaks over the past 40 years. These estimates can be used to parameterize transmission models to improve understanding of initial spread of EVD outbreaks and to inform surveillance and control guidelines. ","829":"Rwanda achieved unprecedented malaria control gains from 2000 to 2010, but cases increased 20-fold between 2011 and 2017. Vector control challenges and environmental changes were noted as potential explanations, but no studies have investigated causes of the resurgence or identified which vector species drove transmission. We conducted a retrospective study in four sites in eastern Rwanda that conducted monthly entomological surveillance and outpatient malaria care. We compared sporozoite rates, human blood index (HBI), and relative abundance of the primary vectors, Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles arabiensis, from 2017 to 2020. We then modeled the effects of vector control interventions, insecticide resistance, and temperature changes on species composition and reported malaria incidence. Sporozoite rates were 28 times higher and HBI was four times higher in An. gambiae compared with An. arabiensis. Insecticide-treated bed nets, first distributed nationally in 2010, were associated with decreased An. gambiae relative abundance. However, increased pyrethroid resistance was associated with increased An. gambiae relative abundance and malaria incidence. Epidemic malaria peaks corresponded to periods of model-predicted An. gambiae re-emergence, and increased regional air temperatures during the period were further associated with increased malaria incidence. Indoor residual spraying (IRS), implemented with non-pyrethroid insecticides later in the period, was associated with 86% reductions in An. gambiae relative abundance and 75% reductions in malaria incidence. These findings suggest that increased pyrethroid resistance and the re-emergence of An. gambiae were closely linked to the malaria resurgence in eastern Rwanda. Non-pyrethroid IRS or other control measures that effectively target An. gambiae may help prevent future resurgences.","830":"Viral nucleic acids, and in some instances viable viruses, have been detected in aerosols in the air in healthcare settings for some respiratory viruses such as seasonal and avian influenza viruses, Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus. However, current evidences are yet to demonstrate that these viruses can effectively spread via airborne route between individuals, or whether preventive measures in airborne precautions would be effective.Health agencies recommend transmission-based precautions, including contact, droplet and airborne precautions, to mitigate transmission of respiratory viruses in healthcare settings. There is particular controversy over the importance of aerosol transmission and whether airborne precautions should be recommended for some respiratory viruses. Here, we review the current recommendations of transmission-based precautions and the latest evidence on the aerosol transmission of respiratory viruses.Studies that use transmission events as outcome to demonstrate human-to-human transmission over the aerosol route or quantitative measurement of infectious respiratory viruses in the air are needed to evaluate the infectiousness of respiratory viruses over the aerosol route. When a respiratory virus in concern only leads to disease with low severity, airborne precautions are not likely to be justified.","831":"A fundamental robotics task is to plan collision-free motions for complex bodies from a start to a goal position among a set of static and dynamic obstacles. This problem is well known in the literature as motion planning (or the piano mover's problem). The complexity of the problem has motivated many works in the field of robot path planning. One of the most popular algorithms is the Artificial Potential Field technique (APF). This method defines an artificial potential field in the configuration space (C-space) that produces a robot path from a start to a goal position. This technique is very fast for RT applications. However, the robot could be trapped in a deadlock (local minima of the potential function). The solution of this problem lies in the use of harmonic functions in the generation of the potential field, which satisfy the Laplace equation. Unfortunately, this technique requires a numerical simulation in a discrete mesh, making useless for RT applications. In our previous work, it was presented for the first time, the Proper Generalized Decomposition method to solve the motion planning problem. In that work, the PGD was designed just for static obstacles and computed as a vademecum for all Start and Goal combinations. This work demonstrates that the PGD could be a solution for the motion planning problem. However, in a realistic scenario, it is necessary to take into account more parameters like for instance, dynamic obstacles. The goal of the present paper is to introduce a diffusion term into the Laplace equation in order to take into account dynamic obstacles as an extra parameter. Both cases, isotropic and non-isotropic cases are into account in order to generalize the solution.","832":"The prevalence of hrHPV DNA in FSWs was 41.7\u00a0% compared to 19.8\u00a0% in the age-matched controls with an overall OR of 2.8 (95 % CI: 2.3-3.4). Significant differences were observed in all age groups, and the most significant differences were observed in the cohort under 21\u00a0years of age (prevalence of 64.4\u00a0% in FSWs versus 14.8\u00a0% in controls; OR 10.3 (95 % CI: 5.0-21.2). Significantly more cervical lesions were observed in FSWs, particularly in the 17- to 21-year old age group (OR for LSIL or HSIL: 10.3 (95 % CI: 3.2-33.8). In both groups, HPV 16 was the most prevalent at 12.1 and 6.6\u00a0% in the FSW and control groups, respectively. HPV 18 was the 8(th) and 7(th) most frequent genotype at 5.0 and 2.5\u00a0% in the FSW and control groups, respectively.HPV genotyping and cytology data were analysed from routine Pap smear tests that were collected from both FSWs and the general population (1334 samples for each group) between June 2006 and June 2010. Within the laboratory database, all FSWs were matched 1:1 for age and testing date to determine the ORs of hrHPV genotypes, DNA and cytology outcome.FSWs have a significantly higher prevalence of hrHPV and more abnormal Pap smears than does the general population in Antwerp, Belgium. The hrHPV prevalence in FSWs is similar to that reported in the literature. The need for tailored intervention programmes should be investigated further.Although female sex workers (FSWs) are a well-known high-risk group for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infections, few tailored intervention programmes for HPV have been established worldwide. The lack of reliable data on the prevalence of HPV and related cervical lesions hampers the establishment of evidence-based intervention programmes. The objectives of this study were to describe the prevalence of high-risk Human Papillomavirus (hrHPV) infections and abnormal pap smears in FSWs compared to a control group in Antwerp, Belgium.","833":"We read the recent article in Psychology of Sport and Exercise by Liu et al. (\"A randomized controlled trial of coordination exercise on cognitive function in obese adolescents\") with great interest. Our interest in the article stemmed from the extraordinary differences in obesity-related outcomes reported in response to a rope-jumping intervention. We requested the raw data from the authors to confirm the results and, after the journal editors reinforced our request, the authors graciously provided us with their data. We share our evaluation of the original data herein, which includes concerns that weight and BMI loss by the intervention appears extraordinary in both magnitude and aspects of the distributions. We request that the authors address our findings by providing explanations of the extraordinary data or correcting any errors that may have occurred in the original report, as appropriate.","834":"Weighted SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was 1.57% (1.48%, 1.66%) in round 15 compared with 0.83% (0.76%, 0.89%) in round 14, and the previously observed link between infections and hospitalisations and deaths had weakened. Vaccine effectiveness against infection in children aged 12 to 17 years was estimated (round 15) at 64.0% (50.9%, 70.6%) and 67.7% (53.8%, 77.5%) for symptomatic infections. Adults who received a third vaccine dose were less likely to test positive compared to those who received two doses, with adjusted OR of 0.36 (0.25, 0.53).Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection with Delta variant was increasing in England in late summer 2021 among children aged 5 to 17 years, and adults who had received two vaccine doses. In September 2021, a third (booster) dose was offered to vaccinated adults aged 50 years and over, vulnerable adults and healthcare\/care-home workers, and a single vaccine dose already offered to 16 and 17 year-olds was extended to children aged 12 to 15 years.Department of Health and Social Care, England.Vaccination of children aged 12 to 17 years and third (booster) doses in adults were effective at reducing infection risk. High rates of vaccination, including booster doses, are a key part of the strategy to reduce infection rates in the community.\u00a0=\u00a0100,112) from the REACT-1 study randomised community surveys. Linking to National Health Service (NHS) vaccination data for consenting participants, we estimated vaccine effectiveness in children aged 12 to 17 years and compared swab-positivity rates in adults who received a third dose with those who received two doses.","835":"Stepped wedge trials are increasingly adopted because practical constraints necessitate staggered roll-out. While a complete design requires clusters to collect data in all periods, resource and patient-centered considerations may call for an incomplete stepped wedge design to minimize data collection burden. To study incomplete designs, we expand the metric of information content to discrete outcomes. We operate under a marginal model with general link and variance functions, and derive information content expressions when data elements (cells, sequences, periods) are omitted. We show that the centrosymmetric patterns of information content can hold for discrete outcomes with the variance-stabilizing link function. We perform numerical studies under the canonical link function, and find that while the patterns of information content for cells are approximately centrosymmetric for all examined underlying secular trends, the patterns of information content for sequences or periods are more sensitive to the secular trend, and may be far from centrosymmetric.","836":"Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are important contributors to the global burden of infectious diseases due to their epidemic potential, which can result in significant population and economic impacts. Oropouche fever, caused by Oropouche virus (OROV), is an understudied zoonotic\u00a0VBD febrile illness reported in Central and South America. The epidemic potential and areas of likely OROV spread remain unexplored, limiting capacities to improve epidemiological surveillance.Hotspots of OROV transmission risk were detected along the tropics of South America. Vegetation loss might be a driver of Oropouche fever emergence. Modeling based on hypervolumes in spatial epidemiology might be considered an exploratory tool for analyzing data-limited emerging infectious diseases for which little understanding exists on their sylvatic cycles. OROV transmission risk maps can be used to improve surveillance, investigate OROV ecology and epidemiology, and inform early detection.Models based on one-support vector machine hypervolumes consistently predicted risk areas for OROV transmission across the tropics of Latin America despite the inclusion of different parameters such as different study areas and environmental predictors. Models estimate that up to 5 million people are at risk of exposure to OROV. Nevertheless, the limited epidemiological data available generates uncertainty in projections. For example, some outbreaks have occurred under climatic conditions outside those where most transmission events occur. The distribution models also revealed that landscape variation, expressed as vegetation loss, is linked to OROV outbreaks.To better understand the capacity for spread of OROV, we developed spatial epidemiology models using human outbreaks as OROV transmission-locality data, coupled with high-resolution satellite-derived vegetation phenology. Data were integrated using hypervolume modeling to infer likely areas of OROV transmission and emergence across the Americas.","837":"Hormone therapy was weakly associated with risk (risk ratio [RR] = 0.9). The negative control exposure was associated with risk (RR = 1.7), suggesting confounding. Based on an assumed prior distribution for the bias parameter, the 95% simulation interval for the distribution of confounding-adjusted RR was (0.17, 1.6), with median 0.5; the 95% credibility interval was similar.Probabilistic bias and Bayesian analyses are important tools for bias correction, particularly when required parameters are nonidentifiable. Negative controls are another tool; they can be used to detect and correct for confounding. Our goals are to present conditions that assure identifiability of certain causal effects and to describe and illustrate a probabilistic bias analysis and related Bayesian analysis that use a negative control exposure.We used dichotomous negative control exposure to identify causal effects when a confounder was unmeasured under strong assumptions. It may be possible to relax assumptions and the negative control exposure could prove helpful for probabilistic bias analyses and Bayesian analyses.Using potential-outcome models, we characterized assumptions needed for identification of causal effects using a dichotomous, negative control exposure when residual confounding exists. We defined bias parameters, characterized their relationships with the negative control and with specified causal effects, and described the corresponding probabilistic-bias and Bayesian analyses. We present analytic examples using data on hormone therapy and suicide attempts among transgender people. To address possible confounding by healthcare utilization, we used prior tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis (TdaP) vaccination as a negative control exposure.","838":"Bivariate binary response data appear in many applications. Interest goes most often to a parameterization of the joint probabilities in terms of the marginal success probabilities in combination with a measure for association, most often being the odds ratio. Using, for example, the bivariate Dale model, these parameters can be modelled as function of covariates. But the odds ratio and other measures for association are not always measuring the (joint) characteristic of interest. Agreement, concordance, and synchrony are in general facets of the joint distribution distinct from association, and the odds ratio as in the bivariate Dale model can be replaced by such an alternative measure. Here, we focus on the so-called conditional synchrony measure. But, as indicated by several authors, such a switch of parameter might lead to a parameterization that does not always lead to a permissible joint bivariate distribution. In this contribution, we propose a new parameterization in which the marginal success probabilities are replaced by other conditional probabilities as well. The new parameters, one homogeneity parameter and two synchrony\/discordance parameters, guarantee that the joint distribution is always permissible. Moreover, having a very natural interpretation, they are of interest on their own. The applicability and interpretation of the new parameterization is shown for three interesting settings: quantifying HIV serodiscordance among couples in Mozambique, concordance in the infection status of two related viruses, and the diagnostic performance of an index test in the field of major depression disorders.","839":"Current HCV monitoring and treatment is projected to result in an incidence of 1.1\/1000 person-years, 0.24% prevalence, at a cost of \u20ac61.8 million (interquartile range 52.2-73.9). Compared with current monitoring, intensified monitoring will result in a maximum 27% reduction of incidence and 33% in prevalence at an increased cost. Conversely, compared with current monitoring, targeted HCV-cAg monitoring will result in a comparable incidence (1.1\/1000 person-years) and prevalence (0.23%) but will be \u20ac1 million cheaper with increased quality-adjusted life year.The World Health Organization declared the goal of hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination by 2030. Micro-elimination, which is the reduction of incidence to zero in targeted populations, is less complex and costly and may be the first step to prove whether elimination is feasible. A suitable target group are HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) because of their high-risk behaviour and high incidence rates. Moreover, HCV monitoring is integrated in HIV care. The current HCV monitoring approach is suboptimal and complex and may miss new HCV infections. Alternative monitoring strategies, based on alanine aminotransferase, HCV-PCR and HCV-core antigen (HCV-cAg), combined with immediate direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment, may be more effective in reducing new HCV infections.Targeted monitoring reduces the HCV epidemic in a cost-saving manner; however, micro-elimination may not be obtained by 2030, highlighting the need for harm-reduction programmes.A deterministic mathematical transmission model was constructed representing the Dutch HCV epidemic among HIV-positive MSM to compare different HCV monitoring strategies from 2018 onwards. We evaluated the epidemiological impact of alternative and intensified monitoring in MSM with HCV. In addition, the cost-effectiveness was calculated over a lifetime horizon.","840":"We propose that sleeping site security was an essential component of sleep regulation throughout primate evolution. This work suggests that sleeping site security may have been an important factor associated with the evolution of sleep in early and later hominins.We used actigraphy and infrared videography to generate sleep measures in 100 individuals (males\u2009=\u200951, females\u2009=\u200949) of seven lemur species (genera: Eulemur, Lemur, Propithecus, and Varecia) at the Duke Lemur Center in Durham, NC. We also generated experimental data using sleep deprivation for 16 individuals. This experiment used a pair-wise design for two sets of paired lemurs from each genus, where the experimental pair experienced a sleep deprivation protocol while the control experienced normal sleeping conditions. We calculated a sleep depth composite metric from weighted z scores of three sleep intensity variables.We found that, relative to cathemeral lemurs, diurnal Propithecus was characterized by the deepest sleep and exhibited the most disruptions to normal sleep-wake regulation when sleep deprived. In contrast, Eulemur mongoz was characterized by significantly lighter sleep than Propithecus, and E. mongoz showed the fewest disruptions to normal sleep-wake regulation when sleep deprived. Security of the sleeping site led to greater sleep depth, with access to outdoor housing linked to lighter sleep in all lemurs that were studied.Primates spend almost half their lives asleep, yet we know little about how evolution has shaped variation in the duration or intensity of sleep (i.e., sleep regulation) across primate species. Our objective was to test hypotheses related to how sleeping site security influences sleep intensity in different lemur species.","841":"In December 2020, Ontario, Canada, entered a provincewide shutdown to mitigate COVID-19 transmission. A regionalized approach was taken to reopen schools throughout early 2021 without any other opening of the economy, offering a unique natural experiment to estimate the impact of school reopening on community transmission. Estimated increases of 0.07, 0.08, 0.07, and 0.13\u00a0percentage points in community COVID-19 case growth rates occurred 11-15, 16-20, 21-25, and 26-30 days, respectively, after schools reopened. Although small, these changes were particularly evident among children younger than age fourteen, increased over time, and were greater when lag periods were considered, which points to a likely causal effect between in-person classes and a small increase in transmission. These findings suggest that although additional COVID-19 cases are to be expected after the reopening of schools, these risks may be manageable with sufficient, layered mitigation policies.","842":"A total of 29 papers were selected for final review based on PRISMA guidelines and the NOS quality assessment. Studies have shown that many forms of SimEx commonly used in disaster management including tabletop exercises, functional exercises, and full-scale exercises have their benefits and limitations. There is no doubt that SimEx is an excellent tool for improving disaster planning and response. It is still necessary to give SimEx programs a more rigorous evaluation and to standardize the processes more thoroughly.Drills and training can be improved for disaster management, which will enable medical professionals to face the challenges of disaster management in the 21st century.Several databases, including PubMed (Medline), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), BioMed Central, and Google Scholar, were used to review the literature. Information was retrieved using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and documents were selected according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). To assess the quality of the selected articles, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) technique was utilized.The simulation exercise (SimEx) simulates an emergency in which an elaboration or description of the response is applied. The purpose of these exercises is to validate and improve plans, procedures, and systems for responding to all hazards. The purpose of this study was to review disaster preparation exercises conducted by various national, non-government, and academic institutions.","843":"HYpothesis testing using PHYlogenies (HyPhy) is a scriptable, open-source package for fitting a broad range of evolutionary models to multiple sequence alignments, and for conducting subsequent parameter estimation and hypothesis testing, primarily in the maximum likelihood statistical framework. It has become a popular choice for characterizing various aspects of the evolutionary process: natural selection, evolutionary rates, recombination, and coevolution. The 2.5 release (available from www.hyphy.org) includes a completely re-engineered computational core and analysis library that introduces new classes of evolutionary models and statistical tests, delivers substantial performance and stability enhancements, improves usability, streamlines end-to-end analysis workflows, makes it easier to develop custom analyses, and is mostly backward compatible with previous HyPhy releases.","844":"We estimated the incubation period of severe acute respiratory syndrome based on a subset of patients with available data on exposure periods and a separate subset of patients in a putative common source outbreak, and we found associations between shorter incubation period and greater severity in both groups after adjusting for potential confounders.Our findings suggest that patients with a shorter incubation period went on to have more severe disease. Further studies are needed to investigate potential biological mechanisms for this association.Few previous studies have investigated the association between the severity of an infectious disease and the length of incubation period.We estimated the association between the length of the incubation period and the severity of infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, using data from the epidemic in 2003 in Hong Kong.","845":"The successful response to COVID-19 in Vietnam could be improved even further with higher levels of symptomatic testing. If the previous approaches are used in response to new COVID-19 outbreaks, epidemic control is possible even in the presence of low levels of imported cases.For this modelling study, we used comprehensive data from June 15 to Oct 15, 2020, on testing, COVID-19 cases, and quarantine breaches within an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to model a COVID-19 outbreak in Da Nang in July, 2020. We applied this model to quantify the risk of future outbreaks in Vietnam in the 3 months after the reopening of international borders, under different behavioural scenarios, policy responses (ie, closure of workplaces and schools), and ongoing testing.For the Vietnamese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.Ministry of Science and Technology (Vietnam).Vietnam has emerged as one of the world's leading success stories in responding to COVID-19. After a prolonged period of little to no transmission, there was an outbreak of unknown source in July, 2020, in the Da Nang region, but the outbreak was quickly suppressed. We aimed to use epidemiological, behavioural, demographic, and policy data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Da Nang to calibrate an agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission for Vietnam, and to estimate the risk of future outbreaks associated with reopening of international borders in the country.We estimated that the outbreak in Da Nang between July and August, 2020, resulted in substantial community transmission, and that higher levels of symptomatic testing could have mitigated this transmission. We estimated that the outbreak peaked on Aug 2, 2020, with an estimated 1060 active infections (95% projection interval 890-1280). If the population of Vietnam remains highly compliant with mask-wearing policies, our projections indicate that the epidemic would remain under control even if a small but steady flow of imported infections escaped quarantine into the community. However, if complacency increases and testing rates are relatively low (10% of symptomatic individuals are tested), the epidemic could rebound again, resulting in an estimated 2100 infections (95% projected interval 1050-3610) in 3 months. These outcomes could be mitigated if the behaviour of the general population responds dynamically to increases in locally acquired cases that exceed specific thresholds, but only if testing of symptomatic individuals is also increased.","846":"Dynamically adapting the allocation of COVID-19 vaccines to the evolving epidemiological situation could be key to reduce COVID-19 burden. Here we developed a data-driven mechanistic model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to explore optimal vaccine prioritization strategies in China. We found that a time-varying vaccination program (i.e., allocating vaccines to different target groups as the epidemic evolves) can be highly beneficial as it is capable of simultaneously achieving different objectives (e.g., minimizing the number of deaths and of infections). Our findings suggest that boosting the vaccination capacity up to 2.5 million first doses per day (0.17% rollout speed) or higher could greatly reduce COVID-19 burden, should a new wave start to unfold in China with reproduction number \u22641.5. The highest priority categories are consistent under a broad range of assumptions. Finally, a high vaccination capacity in the early phase of the vaccination campaign is key to achieve large gains of strategic prioritizations.","847":"The striking reduction of disparities in ED visits suggests that during nonpandemic periods, respiratory viruses contribute to the excess burden of asthma-related ED visits among Black and Latinx children with asthma. Although further investigation is needed to test this hypothesis, our findings raise the question of whether Black and Latinx children with asthma are more vulnerable to upper respiratory viral infections.There are marked disparities in asthma-related emergency department (ED) visit rates among children by race and ethnicity. Following the implementation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention measures, asthma-related ED visits rates declined substantially. The decline has been attributed to the reduced circulation of upper respiratory viruses, a common trigger of asthma exacerbations in children.Asthma-related ED visits were extracted from electronic medical records at Dell Children's Medical Center in Travis County, Texas. ED visit rates among children with asthma were derived by race\/ethnicity. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% CIs were estimated by year (2019-2021) and season.In spring 2019, the ED visit IRRs comparing Black children with White children and Latinx children with White children were 6.67 (95% CI\u00a0= 4.92-9.05) and 2.10 (95% CI\u00a0= 1.57-2.80), respectively. In spring 2020, when infection prevention measures were implemented, the corresponding IRRs decreased to 1.73 (95% CI\u00a0= 0.90-3.32) and 0.68 (95% CI\u00a0= 0.38-1.23), respectively.To better understand the contribution of respiratory viruses to racial and ethnic disparities in ED visit rates, we investigated whether the reduction in ED visit rates affected Black, Latinx, and White children with asthma equally.","848":"T cells in the human female genital tract (FGT) are key mediators of susceptibility to and protection from infection, including HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. There is a critical need for increased understanding of the distribution and activation of T cell populations in the FGT, but current sampling methods require a healthcare provider and are expensive, limiting the ability to study these populations longitudinally. To address these challenges, we have developed a method to sample immune cells from the FGT utilizing disposable menstrual discs which are noninvasive, self-applied, and low in cost. To demonstrate reproducibility, we sampled the cervicovaginal fluid of healthy, reproductive-aged individuals using menstrual discs across 3 sequential days. Cervicovaginal fluid was processed for cervicovaginal cells, and high-parameter flow cytometry was used to characterize immune populations. We identified large numbers of live, CD45+ leukocytes, as well as distinct populations of T cells and B cells. Within the T cell compartment, activation and suppression status of T cell subsets were consistent with previous studies of the FGT utilizing current approaches, including identification of both tissue-resident and migratory populations. In addition, the T cell population structure was highly conserved across days within individuals but divergent across individuals. Our approach to sample immune cells in the FGT with menstrual discs will decrease barriers to participation and empower longitudinal sampling in future research studies.","849":"Due to waning immunity, adults aged \u226565\u00a0years are at increased risk of seasonal influenza infection and its complications. Adding to this risk, older adults have reduced responses to influenza vaccines. A high-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluzone High-Dose, Sanofi Pasteur) (IIV3-HD) was developed to improve protection against influenza in adults aged \u226565\u00a0years and has been licensed in the US since 2009 and in Canada since 2015. Post-licensure studies have shown that IIV3-HD is more effective than standard-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3-SD) at protecting against influenza infection in this population. Here, we performed a systematic review of economic analyses of IIV3-HD in adults aged \u226565\u00a0years.Seven studies were selected, all performed in the US or Canada. Five studies were funded by IIV3-HD manufacturer, and the remaining two by the US National Institute of General Medical Sciences. In all studies, IIV3-HD reduces healthcare resource utilization and is cost-effective or cost-saving compared to IIV3-SD. The main driver is reduced hospitalizations for cardiorespiratory events.On June 9, 2019, using the Ovid search platform, we searched Econlit, Embase, and Ovid MEDLINE\u00ae for original studies published in peer-reviewed journals examining the economics or cost-effectiveness of IIV3-HD in adults aged \u226565\u00a0years. Two reviewers independently selected studies and assessed their quality.IIV3-HD is cost-saving or cost-effective versus IIV3-SD in adults aged \u226565\u00a0years. Reduced cardiorespiratory complications are an important driver of these economic benefits.

Meaningful improvements were also observed in relation to knowledge (29.0% to 43.0%), attitude (53.0% to 90.0%), and practices (25.0% to 70.0%) of rural communities regarding cord care. Marked improvements were also observed in the intervention group related to understanding causes of cord infections; importance of cord cleanliness; use of antiseptic and other preventive measures; care-seeking behavior; and ensuring hygienic childbirth.Developing countries account for 99.0% of the 2.7 million neonatal deaths occurring worldwide each year. Umbilical cord infection contributes greatly to this predicament, but evidence shows that 7.1% chlorhexidine solution (CHX) can substantially reduce the risk of infection. To address this challenge, this study aimed to determine the effect of a social and behavioral change communication (SBCC) intervention on promoting the use of WHO recommended CHX as well as on improving the knowledge, attitude, and practices of rural communities regarding umbilical cord care in hard-to-reach areas of Bangladesh.This pioneer study revealed that SBCC interventions led to an increase in CHX use and improved the knowledge, attitude and practices of Bangladeshi communities regarding cord care and cord infection. This indicates that SBCC intervention is indeed an effective and feasible method for reducing infant mortality rates in hard-to-reach populations and achieving SDG goal 3.2.","851":"Habitat loss and fragmentation can negatively influence population persistence and biodiversity, but the effects can be mitigated if species successfully disperse between isolated habitat patches. Network models are the primary tool for quantifying landscape connectivity, yet in practice, an overly simplistic view of species dispersal is applied. These models often ignore individual variation in dispersal ability under the assumption that all individuals move the same fixed distance with equal probability. We developed a modeling approach to address this problem. We incorporated dispersal kernels into network models to determine how individual variation in dispersal alters understanding of landscape-level connectivity and implemented our approach on a fragmented grassland landscape in Minnesota. Ignoring dispersal variation consistently overestimated a population's robustness to local extinctions and underestimated its robustness to local habitat loss. Furthermore, a simplified view of dispersal underestimated the amount of habitat substructure for small populations but overestimated habitat substructure for large populations. Our results demonstrate that considering biologically realistic dispersal alters understanding of landscape connectivity in ecological theory and conservation practice.","852":"The HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa is far from being under control and the ambitious UNAIDS targets are unlikely to be met by 2020 as declines in per-capita incidence being largely offset by demographic trends. There is an increasing number of proven and specific HIV prevention tools, but little consensus on how best to deploy them.Traditionally, phylogenetics has been used in HIV research to reconstruct the history of the epidemic and date zoonotic infections, whereas more recent publications focus on HIV diversity and drug resistance. However, it is also the most powerful method of source attribution available for the study of HIV transmission. The PANGEA (Phylogenetics And Networks for Generalized Epidemics in Africa) consortium has generated over 18\u200a000 NGS HIV sequences from five countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Using phylogenetic methods, we will identify characteristics of individuals or groups, which are most likely to be at risk of infection or at risk of infecting others.Combining phylogenetics, phylodynamics and epidemiology will allow PANGEA to highlight where prevention efforts should be focussed to reduce the HIV epidemic most effectively. To maximise the public health benefit of the data, PANGEA offers accreditation to external researchers, allowing them to access the data and join the consortium. We also welcome submissions of other HIV sequences from sub-Saharan Africa to the database.","853":"The duration of viral shedding is determined by a balance between de novo infection and removal of infected cells. That is, if infection is completely blocked with antiviral drugs (100% inhibition), the duration of viral shedding is minimal and is determined by the length of virus production. However, some mathematical models predict that if infected individuals are treated with antiviral drugs with efficacy below 100%, viral shedding may last longer than without treatment because further de novo infections are driven by entry of the virus into partially protected, uninfected cells at a slower rate. Using a simple mathematical model, we quantified SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in non-human primates and characterized the kinetics of viral shedding. We counterintuitively found that treatments initiated early, such as 0.5 d after virus inoculation, with intermediate to relatively high efficacy (30-70% inhibition of virus replication) yield a prolonged duration of viral shedding (by about 6.0 d) compared with no treatment.","854":"Online social networks are the perfect test bed to better understand large-scale human behavior in interacting contexts. Although they are broadly used and studied, little is known about how their terms of service and posting rules affect the way users interact and information spreads. Acknowledging the relation between network connectivity and functionality, we compare the robustness of two different online social platforms, Twitter and Gab, with respect to dismantling strategies based on the recursive censor of users characterized by social prominence (degree) or intensity of inflammatory content (sentiment). We find that the moderated (Twitter) vs unmoderated (Gab) character of the network is not a discriminating factor for intervention effectiveness. We find, however, that more complex strategies based upon the combination of topological and content features may be effective for network dismantling. Our results provide useful indications to design better strategies for countervailing the production and dissemination of anti-social content in online social platforms.","855":"In many species, individuals that experience harsh conditions during development have poor health and fitness outcomes in adulthood, compared with peers that do not. These early-life contributions to inequality are often attributed to two classes of evolutionary hypotheses: Developmental Constraints (DC) models, which focus on the deleterious effects of low-quality early-life environments, and Predictive Adaptive Response (PAR) hypotheses, which emphasize the costs individuals incur when they make incorrect predictions about conditions in adulthood. Testing these hypotheses empirically is difficult for conceptual and analytical reasons. Here, we help resolve some of these difficulties by providing mathematical definitions for DC, PAR (particularly focusing on 'external' PAR) and related concepts. We propose a novel, quadratic regression-based statistical test derived from these definitions. Our simulations show that this approach markedly improves the ability to discriminate between DC and PAR hypotheses relative to the status quo approach, which uses interaction effects. Simulated data indicate that the interaction effects approach often conflates PAR with DC, while the quadratic regression approach yields high sensitivity and specificity for detecting PAR. Our results highlight the value of linking verbal and visual models to a formal mathematical treatment for understanding the developmental origins of inequitable adult outcomes. This article is part of the theme issue 'Evolutionary ecology of inequality'.","856":"For pathogens known to transmit across host species, strategic investment in disease control requires knowledge about where and when spillover transmission is likely. One approach to estimating spillover is to directly correlate observed spillover events with covariates. An alternative is to mechanistically combine information on host density, distribution and pathogen prevalence to predict where and when spillover events are expected to occur. We use several case studies at the wildlife-livestock disease interface to highlight the challenges, and potential solutions, to estimating spatio-temporal variation in spillover risk. Datasets on multiple host species often do not align in space, time or resolution, and may have no estimates of observation error. Linking these datasets requires they be related to a common spatial and temporal resolution and appropriately propagating errors in predictions can be difficult. Hierarchical models are one potential solution, but for fine-resolution predictions at broad spatial scales, many models become computationally challenging. Despite these limitations, the confrontation of mechanistic predictions with observed events is an important avenue for developing a better understanding of pathogen spillover. Systems where data have been collected at all levels in the spillover process are rare, or non-existent, and require investment and sustained effort across disciplines. This article is part of the theme issue 'Dynamic and integrative approaches to understanding pathogen spillover'.","857":"Woody plant encroachment (WPE) into grasslands is a global phenomenon that is associated with land degradation via xerification, which replaces grasses with shrubs and bare soil patches. It remains uncertain how the global processes of WPE and climate change may combine to impact water availability for ecosystems. Using a process-based model constrained by watershed observations, our results suggest that both xerification and climate change augment groundwater recharge by increasing channel transmission losses at the expense of plant available water. Conversion from grasslands to shrublands without creating additional bare soil, however, reduces transmission losses. Model simulations considering both WPE and climate change are used to assess their relative roles in a late 21st century condition. Results indicate that changes in focused channel recharge are determined primarily by the WPE pathway. As a result, WPE should be given consideration when assessing the vulnerability of groundwater aquifers to climate change.","858":"The growing number of systems science simulation models for alcohol use (AU) are often disconnected from AU models within empirical and theoretical alcohol research. As AU prevention\/intervention efforts are typically grounded in alcohol research, this disconnect may reduce policy testing results, impact, and implementation. We developed a simulation model guided by AU research (accounting for the multiple AU stages defined by AU behavior and risk for harm and diverse transitions between stages). Simulated projections were compared to historical data to evaluate model accuracy and potential policy leverage points for prevention and intervention at risky drinking (RD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) stages. Results indicated prevention provided the greatest RD and AUD reduction; however, focusing exclusively on AUD prevention may not be effective for long-term change, given the continued increase in RD. This study makes a case for the strength and importance of aligning subject-based research with systems science simulation models.","859":"We analyzed representative national surveys from 15 countries conducted between 2001 and 2016. We estimated maternal-child health coverage gaps using the Composite Coverage Index - a weighted average of interventions that include family planning, maternal and newborn care, immunizations, and treatment of sick children. We measured absolute and relative inequality to assess gaps by wealth quintile. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to test the association between the coverage gap and population attributable risk.The Composite Coverage Index showed patterns of inequality favoring the wealthiest subgroups. In eight countries the national coverage was higher than the global median (78.4%; 95% CI: 73.1-83.6) and increased significantly as inequality decreased (Pearson r = 0.9; p <\u20090.01).Maternal and child health have shown important advances in the world in recent years. However, national averages indicators hide large inequalities in access and quality of care in population subgroups. We explore wealth-related inequalities affecting health coverage and interventions in reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health in Latin America and the Caribbean.There are substantial inequalities between socioeconomic groups. Reducing inequalities will improve coverage indicators for women and children. Additional health policies, programs, and practices are required to promote equity.","860":"In the U.S., overdose deaths and substance treatment admissions related to methamphetamine are rising. This study aims to measure and compare U.S. temporal trends in methamphetamine-involved psychiatric hospitalizations.From Q4 2015-Q4 2019, there were 963,202 psychiatric hospitalizations, 50,223 (5.2\u2009%) involved methamphetamine and 102,877 (10.7\u2009%) involved opioids and\/or cocaine without methamphetamine. Methamphetamine-involved psychiatric hospitalization rates increased by 68.0\u2009%, psychiatric hospitalizations rates involving opioid and\/or cocaine without methamphetamine decreased by 22\u2009%, while nonsubstance-involved psychiatric hospitalizations rates remained unchanged. The largest significant increases in methamphetamine-involved psychiatric hospitalization rates were among people >61 years old, males, and Midwesterners. Methamphetamine-involved psychiatric hospitalization rates doubled among Black patients. The largest average percent increase among methamphetamine-involved psychiatric hospitalizations was 10.2\u2009% from Q4 2015-Q2 2017 in the Midwest.Most psychiatric hospitalizations did not involve substances. Methamphetamine-involved psychiatric hospitalizations greatly increased while opioid-involved psychiatric hospitalizations decreased, but involved more total encounters. Greater access to harm reduction services, contingency management programs, and mental health services is urgently needed.We conducted a population-based, trend analysis of U.S. psychiatric hospitalizations and calculated quarterly (Q) rates per 100,000 population of substance-involved psychiatric hospitalizations. We assessed U.S. regional quarterly percentage hospitalization rate changes using Joinpoint regression.","861":"This study suggests that as many as half a million (\u223c14%) pregnant persons who gave birth each year were not tested for HBsAg to prevent perinatal transmission. More than 50% of HBsAg-positive persons did not receive the recommended HBV-directed monitoring tests during pregnancy and after delivery.The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends testing all pregnant women for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and testing HBsAg-positive pregnant women for hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV DNA). HBsAg-positive pregnant persons are recommended by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases to receive regular monitoring, including alanine transaminase (ALT) and HBV DNA and antiviral therapy for active hepatitis and to prevent perinatal HBV transmission if HBV DNA level is >200,000 IU\/mL.Using Optum Clinformatics Data Mart Database claims data, pregnant women who received HBsAg testing and HBsAg-positive pregnant persons who received HBV DNA and alt testing and antiviral therapy during pregnancy and after delivery during January 1, 2015-December 31, 2020 were analyzed.Among 506,794 pregnancies, 14.6% did not receive HBsAg testing. Pregnant women more likely to receive testing for HBsAg (p1 child, or received education beyond high school. Among the 0.28% (1,437) pregnant women who tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, 46% were Asian. The proportion of HBsAg-positive pregnant women who received HBV DNA testing during pregnancy and in the 12 months after delivery was 44.3% and 28.6%, respectively; the proportion that received hepatitis B e antigen was 31.6% and 12.7%, respectively; the proportion that received ALT testing was 67.4% and 47%, respectively; and the proportion that received HBV antiviral therapy was 7% and 6.2%, respectively.","862":"Despite great progress in understanding lipoprotein physiology, there is still much to be learned about the genetic drivers of lipoprotein abundance, composition, and function. We used ion mobility spectrometry to survey 16 plasma lipoprotein subfractions in 500 Diversity Outbred (DO) mice maintained on a Western-style diet. We identified 21 quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting lipoprotein abundance. To refine the QTL and link them to disease risk in humans, we asked if the human homologues of genes located at each QTL were associated with lipid traits in human genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Integration of mouse QTL with human GWAS yielded candidate gene drivers for 18 of the 21 QTL. This approach enabled us to nominate the gene encoding the neutral ceramidase, Asah2, as a novel candidate driver at a QTL on chromosome 19 for large HDL particles (HDL-2b). To experimentally validate Asah2, we surveyed lipoproteins in Asah2-\/- mice. Compared to wild-type mice, female Asah2-\/- mice showed an increase in several lipoproteins, including HDL. Our results provide insights into the genetic regulation of circulating lipoproteins, as well as mechanisms by which lipoprotein subfractions may affect cardiovascular disease risk in humans.","863":"A Markov cohort decision analysis model evaluated treatment options for a 60-year-old patient with resectable PDAC: (1) upfront pancreaticoduodenectomy or (2) NAT. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. A subanalysis considered the scenario of a 75-year-old patient.This analysis demonstrates a significant benefit to NAT in patients with localized PDAC. This benefit persists even in the elderly cohort.For the base case, NAT offered an incremental survival gain of 4.6 months compared with SF (overall survival: 26.3 vs. 21.7 months). In one-way sensitivity analyses, findings were sensitive to recurrence-free survival for NAT patients undergoing adjuvant, probability of completing NAT, and probability of being resectable at exploration after NAT. On probabilistic analysis, NAT was favored in a majority of trials (97%) with a median survival benefit of 5.1 months. In altering the base case for the 75-year-old scenario, NAT had a survival benefit of 3.8 months.Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is an emerging strategy for operable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). While NAT increases multimodal therapy completion, it risks functional decline and treatment dropout. We used decision analysis to determine optimal management of localized PDAC and consider risks faced by elderly patients.","864":"Local governments and other public health entities often need population health measures at the county or subcounty level for activities such as resource allocation and targeting public health interventions, among others. Information collected via national surveys alone cannot fill these needs. We propose a novel, two-step method for rescaling health survey data and creating small area estimates (SAEs) of smoking rates using a Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey administered in 2015 to participants living in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, USA.The ever-smoking rate was above 70% for two census tracts to the southeast of the city of Pittsburgh. Several tracts in the southern and eastern sections of Pittsburgh also had relatively high (>\u200965%) ever-smoking rates.These SAEs may be used in local public health efforts to target interventions and educational resources aimed at reducing cigarette smoking. Further, our new two-step methodology may be extended to small area estimation for other locations and health outcomes.The first step consisted of a spatial microsimulation to rescale location of survey respondents from zip codes to tracts based on census population distributions by age, sex, race, and education. The rescaling allowed us, in the second step, to utilize available census tract-specific ancillary data on social vulnerability for small area estimation of local health risk using an area-level version of a logistic linear mixed model. To demonstrate this new two-step algorithm, we estimated the ever-smoking rate for the census tracts of Allegheny County.","865":"This evaluation was a cross-sectional analysis of a random sample of 19,497 national certified EMS clinicians who were selected to receive an electronic survey in April 2022. The survey included an assessment of their level of stress using the Perceived Stress Scale instrument and examined changes in their working environment they perceived had occurred due to the emergence of COVID-19. Logistic regression modeling was used to evaluate the associations between workforce demographics, infrastructure, scheduling, and policies to and COVID-19-induced coworker conflict.A total of 1686 responses were evaluated (response rate 10%). We found that COVID-19 was reported to have exacerbated conflict between coworkers in 51% of responses. Respondents who perceived an increase in coworker conflict due to COVID-19 self-reported higher levels of stress than the rest of the respondents. Perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 on conflict had also an association with the level of certification, indicating that national registered paramedics were more likely than emergency medical technicians to report coworker conflict due to COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.61). Multivariable analysis highlighted the impact of mandatory overtime policies, reported by 27% of the respondents and associated with higher odds of exacerbated coworker conflict in our model (AOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.62-2.60).These findings indicate that conflict can be considered a potential indicator of high levels of stress in the EMS workforce and may be a reliable signal to monitor when implementing mandates that affect EMS clinicians and their workloads.Safety policies enacted in response to the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have greatly affected the working environments of emergency medical service (EMS) clinicians. Our objective was to evaluate whether changes in the EMS environment during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with increased workplace conflict.","866":"R t shifted from 2-3 in March to <1 during April and May. R t rose over the summer and stayed between 1.4 and 0.7. The introduction of statewide mask mandates was associated with a decline in R t (-15.3%; 95% CrI, -13.6%, -16.8%), and school re-opening, an increase by 12.3% (95% CrI, 10.1%, 14.4%). Less densely populated counties had higher attack rates (P < 0.0001).The R t dynamics over time indicated that public health interventions substantially slowed COVID-19 transmission in South Carolina, while their relaxation may have promoted further transmission. Policies encouraging people to stay home, such as closing nonessential businesses, were associated with R t reduction, while policies that encouraged more movement, such as re-opening schools, were associated with R t increase.COVID-19 case series (March 6, 2020, to January 10, 2021) were shifted by 9 d to approximate the infection date. We analyzed the effects of state and county policies on R t using EpiEstim. We performed linear regression to evaluate if per-capita cumulative case count varies across counties with different population size.We aimed to examine how public health policies influenced the dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) time-varying reproductive number (R t ) in South Carolina from February 26, 2020, to January 1, 2021.","867":"Estimates of influenza vaccination effectiveness (VE) are valuable for populations where the vaccine has been promoted in order to support vaccination policy and to permit evaluation of vaccination strategies. Such studies would be important for China due to limited data available during seasons when the vaccine strains matched or mismatched the circulating viruses.A total of 2368 inpatients were recruited during the study period with a vaccination coverage in the control group of 12.8%. The overall estimate of influenza VE was 46.9% (95% CI: -20.4%, 76.6%) for the 2013-14 season and 5.0% (95% CI: -53.0%, 41.0%) for the 2014-15 season. Estimates of VE were relatively higher in children aged 6-17 years than older persons across two influenza seasons while estimates of VE for both adults and elderly were relatively low.We conducted a test-negative study in hospitals in Beijing. Patients admitted to five hospitals in the city were enrolled during the winter influenza seasons of 2013-14 and 2014-15. Influenza virus infections were determined by PCR, and influenza vaccination records were extracted from a centralized electronic immunization registry. Influenza VE was estimated by logistic regression adjusting for age group, sex and chronic conditions, and matched by calendar week.Our findings were consistent with expected influenza vaccination effectiveness in seasons when the vaccine matched or mismatched circulating viruses. Strategies to increase influenza vaccine coverage could provide a public health benefit.","868":"While experts have recognised the significance and necessity of social media integration in healthcare, no systematic method has been devised in Malaysia or Southeast Asia to include social media input into the hospital quality improvement process. The goal of this work is to explain how to develop a machine learning system for classifying Facebook reviews of public hospitals in Malaysia by using service quality (SERVQUAL) dimensions and sentiment analysis. We developed a Machine Learning Quality Classifier (MLQC) based on the SERVQUAL model and a Machine Learning Sentiment Analyzer (MLSA) by manually annotated multiple batches of randomly chosen reviews. Logistic regression (LR), naive Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), and other methods were used to train the classifiers. The performance of each classifier was tested using 5-fold cross validation. For topic classification, the average F1-score was between 0.687 and 0.757 for all models. In a 5-fold cross validation of each SERVQUAL dimension and in sentiment analysis, SVM consistently outperformed other methods. The study demonstrates how to use supervised learning to automatically identify SERVQUAL domains and sentiments from patient experiences on a hospital's Facebook page. Malaysian healthcare providers can gather and assess data on patient care via the use of these content analysis technology to improve hospital quality of care.","869":"SignificanceMetagenomic pathogen sequencing offers an unbiased approach to characterizing febrile illness. In resource-scarce settings with high biodiversity, it is critical to identify disease-causing pathogens in order to understand burden and to prioritize efforts for control. Here, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) characterization of the pathogen landscape in Cambodia revealed diverse vector-borne and zoonotic pathogens irrespective of age and gender as risk factors. Identification of key pathogens led to changes in national program surveillance. This study is a \"real world\" example of the use of mNGS surveillance of febrile individuals, executed in-country, to identify outbreaks of vector-borne, zoonotic, and other emerging pathogens in a resource-scarce setting.","870":"The electronic health records (EHR) infrastructure offers a tremendous resource for identifying controls who match the characteristics of study participants in a single-arm trial. The objectives are to (1) demonstrate the feasibility of curating a synthetic control group for an existing study cohort through EHR data extraction and (2) evaluate the effect of a lifestyle intervention on selected cardiovascular health metrics. A total of 711 university employees were recruited between 2008 and 2012 to participate in a health partner intervention to improve cardiovascular health and were followed for five years. Data of nearly 8000 eligible subjects were extracted from the EHR to create a synthetic control cohort during the same study period. To minimize confounding, crude comparison, exact matching, propensity score matching, and doubly robust estimation were used to compare the selected cardiovascular health metrics at 1 and 5\u00a0years of follow-up. Blood pressure and body mass index improved in the intervention group compared to the EHR synthetic controls. The findings of changes in lipid measurements were somewhat unexpected. When analyzing the subgroup without lipid-lowering medications, the intervention group exhibited better control of cholesterol levels over time than did our synthetic controls. Some measurements in the EHR system may be more robust for synthetic selection than others. EHR synthetic controls can provide an alternative to estimate intervention effects appropriately in single-arm studies for these measurements.","871":" memory T cell responses-can reduce the overall (pulmonary and extrapulmonary) extent of Mtb infection and disease by 68%, as compared to that in unvaccinated controls, after intrabronchial challenge with the Erdman strain of Mtb at \u223c1 year after the first vaccination. Fourteen of 34 RhCMV\/TB-vaccinated RMs (41%) across both studies showed no TB disease by computed tomography scans or at necropsy after challenge (as compared to 0 of 17 unvaccinated controls), and ten of these RMs were Mtb-culture-negative for all tissues, an exceptional long-term vaccine effect in the RM challenge model with the Erdman strain of Mtb. These results suggest that complete vaccine-mediated immune control of highly pathogenic Mtb is possible if immune effector responses can intercept Mtb infection at its earliest stages.","872":"Predicting an individual's risk of primary stroke is an important tool that can help to lower the burden of stroke for both the individual and society. There are a number of risk models and risk scores in existence but no review or classification designed to help the reader better understand how models differ and the reasoning behind these differences. In this paper we review the existing literature on primary stroke risk prediction models. From our literature review we identify key similarities and differences in the existing models. We find that models can differ in a number of ways, including the event type, the type of analysis, the model type and the time horizon. Based on these similarities and differences we have created a set of questions and a system to help answer those questions that modelers and readers alike can use to help classify and better understand the existing models as well as help to make necessary decisions when creating a new model.","873":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.jvacx.2021.100127.].","874":"Our results indicate that the four species have different levels of specialization, and that this can be explained by their climatic niche breadth. In addition, our results show that, at least for some species, floral morphology can be explained by the identity of floral visitors, with climate having only an indirect effect.Our results demonstrate that, even in very specialized interactions, both biotic and abiotic variables can explain a substantial amount of intraspecific variation in floral morphology.We used a combination of large-scale plant and pollinator samplings, morphological measures and climatic data. We analysed the data using spatial approaches, as well as traditional multivariate and structural equation modelling approaches.The diversity of floral morphology among plant species has long captured the interest of biologists and led to the development of a number of explanatory theories. Floral morphology varies substantially within species, and the mechanisms maintaining this diversity are diverse. One possibility is that spatial variation in the pollinator fauna drives the evolution of spatially divergent floral ecotypes adapted to the local suite of pollinators. Another possibility is that geographic variation in the abiotic environment and local climatic conditions favours different floral morphologies in different regions. Although both possibilities have been shown to explain floral variation in some cases, they have rarely been competed against one another using data collected from large spatial scales. In this study, we assess floral variation in relation to climate and floral visitors in four oil-reward-specialized pollination interactions.","875":"The greater U.S. Midwest is on the leading edge of tick and tick-borne disease (TBD) expansion, with tick and TBD encroachment into Illinois occurring from both the northern and the southern regions. To assess the historical and future habitat suitability of four ticks of medical concern within the state, we fit individual and mean-weighted ensemble species distribution models for Ixodes scapularis, Amblyomma americanum, Dermacentor variabilis, and a newly invading species, Amblyomma maculatum using a variety of landscape and mean climate variables for the periods of 1970-2000, 2041-2060, and 2061-2080. Ensemble model projections for the historical climate were consistent with known distributions of each species but predicted the habitat suitability of A. maculatum to be much greater throughout Illinois than what known distributions demonstrate. The presence of forests and wetlands were the most important landcover classes predicting the occurrence of all tick species. As the climate warmed, the expected distribution of all species became strongly responsive to precipitation and temperature variables, particularly precipitation of the warmest quarter and mean diurnal range, as well as proximity to forest cover and water sources. The suitable habitat for I. scapularis, A. americanum, and A. maculatum was predicted to significantly narrow in the 2050 climate scenario and then increase more broadly statewide in the 2070 scenario but at reduced likelihoods. Predicting where ticks may invade and concentrate as the climate changes will be important to anticipate, prevent, and treat TBD in Illinois.","876":"As SARS-CoV-2 transmission continues to evolve, understanding how location-specific variations in non-pharmaceutical interventions and behaviors contributed to disease transmission during the initial epidemic wave will be key for future control strategies. We offer a rigorous statistical analysis of the relative effectiveness of the timing of both official stay-at-home orders and population mobility reductions during the initial stage of the US epidemic. We use a Bayesian hierarchical regression to fit county-level mortality data from the first case on Jan 21 2020 through Apr 20 2020 and quantify associations between the timing of stay-at-home orders and population mobility with epidemic control. We find that among 882 counties with an early local epidemic, a 10-day delay in the enactment of stay-at-home orders would have been associated with 14,700 additional deaths by Apr 20 (95% credible interval, 9,100, 21,500), whereas shifting orders 10 days earlier would have been associated with nearly 15,700 fewer lives lost (95% credible interval, 11,350, 18,950). Analogous estimates are available for reductions in mobility-which typically occurred before stay-at-home orders-and are also stratified by county urbanicity, showing significant heterogeneity. Results underscore the importance of timely policy and behavioral action for early-stage epidemic control.","877":"Of 500 participants enrolled (mean age 58), 45.6% were African American and 51.6% White. Remote diagnostic evaluation of ocular screening by ophthalmologist revealed 30% GAD, 6.8% diabetic retinopathy, 37.6% cataract, 68.4% refractive error, 9.2% other eye conditions. 47.2% were referred for follow-up examination and for acuity 20\/40 or worse or IOP \u2265 23mmHG in one or both eyes.

In total, 657 men will be recruited and randomized to intervention and control arms in a 2:1 ratio. Participants in the intervention arm will receive access to the full HealthMindr app, with information and resources about PrEP (eg, frequently asked questions, risk assessment tool, and PrEP provider locator), other HIV prevention information, ability to order free HIV\/sexually transmitted infection test kits, and additional resources related to substance use and mental health. Participants in the control arm will use the HealthMindr app but will only have access to the study timeline and a message center to communicate with study staff. Participants will complete quarterly surveys to assess self-reported PrEP uptake over 12 months of follow-up. Self-reported PrEP uptake will be verified by dried blood spot testing and\/or uploading a photograph of a PrEP prescription.This trial will determine whether the HealthMindr app can increase PrEP uptake among MSM in the southern United States.HealthMindr is a mobile phone HIV prevention app for men who have sex with men (MSM). In a previous pilot study, HealthMindr was found to be acceptable among users and to demonstrate preliminary effectiveness for increasing pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake among MSM. PrEP is a highly effective HIV prevention intervention; however, uptake remains low.PRR1-10.2196\/16231.The aim of this study will be to assess the efficacy of a mobile app for increasing PrEP uptake among MSM in the southern United States.Participant recruitment began in January 2020.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03763942; https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT03763942.","879":"In northwestern Kenya, Turkana County has been historically considered unsuitable for stable malaria transmission because of its unfavorable climate and predominantly semi-nomadic population; consequently, it is overlooked during malaria control planning. However, the area is changing, with substantial development, an upsurge in travel associated with resource extraction, and more populated settlements forming. Recently, numerous malaria outbreaks have highlighted the need to characterize malaria transmission and its associated risk factors in the region to inform control strategies. Reactive case detection of confirmed malaria cases at six health facilities across central Turkana was conducted from 2018 to 2019. Infections in household members of index cases were detected by malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and PCR tests, and they were grouped according household and individual characteristics. The relationships between putative risk factors and infection were quantified by multilevel logistic regression models. Of the 3,189 household members analyzed, 33.6% had positive RDT results and\/or PCR test results. RDT-detected infections were more prevalent in children; however, PCR-detected infections were similarly prevalent across age groups. Recent travel was rarely reported and not significantly associated with infection. Bed net coverage was low and net crowding was associated with increased risks of household infections. Infections were present year-round, and fluctuations in prevalence were not associated with rainfall. These findings indicate year-round, endemic transmission with moderate population immunity. This is in stark contrast to recent estimates in this area. Therefore, further investigations to design effective intervention approaches to address malaria in this rapidly changing region and other similar settings across the Horn of Africa are warranted.","880":"Proactive and objective regulatory risk management of ongoing clinical trials is limited, especially when it involves the safety of the trial. We seek to prospectively evaluate the risk of facing adverse outcomes from standardized and routinely collected protocol data. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 2860 Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials that were started and completed between 1993 and 2017 and documented in ClinicalTrials.gov. Adverse outcomes considered in our work\u00a0include Serious or Non-Serious as per the ClinicalTrials.gov definition. Random-forest-based prediction models were created to determine a trial's risk of adverse outcomes based on protocol data that is available before the start of a trial enrollment. A trial's\u00a0risk is defined by dichotomic (classification) and continuous (log-odds) risk scores. The classification-based prediction models had an area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.865 to 0.971 and the continuous-score based models indicate a rank correlation of 0.6-0.66 (with p-values <\u20090.001), thereby demonstrating improved identification of risk of adverse outcomes. Whereas related frameworks highlight the prediction benefits of incorporating data that is highly context-specific, our results indicate that Adverse Event (AE) risks can be reliably predicted through a framework of mild data requirements. We propose three potential applications in leading regulatory remits, highlighting opportunities to support regulatory oversight and informed consent decisions.","881":"Understanding the cellular composition of a disease-related tissue is important in disease diagnosis, prognosis, and downstream treatment. Recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technique have allowed the measurement of gene expression profiles for individual cells. However, scRNA-seq is still too expensive to be used for large-scale population studies, and bulk RNA-seq is still widely used in such situations. An essential challenge is to deconvolve cellular composition for bulk RNA-seq data based on scRNA-seq data. Here, we present DeepDecon, a deep neural network model that leverages single-cell gene expression information to accurately predict the fraction of cancer cells in bulk tissues. It provides a refining strategy in which the cancer cell fraction is iteratively estimated by a set of trained models. When applied to simulated and real cancer data, DeepDecon exhibits superior performance compared to existing decomposition methods in terms of accuracy.","882":"Key informants were selected for semi-structured interviews due to their role in providing pharmacy services in the selected country: the Central African Republic (CAR), the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, and South Sudan. Transcripts from the interviews were anonymized, coded, and analyzed.Nine participants were recruited (CAR: 2; DRC: 2; Ethiopia: 2; South Sudan: 3), and all except two were pharmacists. Conflict-specific challenges in pharmacy service delivery were identified as the following: unpredictable health needs and\/or mismatched pharmaceutical supply, transport difficulties due to insecure roads, and shortage of pharmacy workforce due to brain drain or interrupted schooling. Barriers to health workforce retention and growth were identified to be brain drain as a result of suboptimal living and working conditions or remuneration, the perception of an unsafe work environment, and a career pathway or commitment duration that does not fit the diaspora or expatriate staff.To tackle the barriers of pharmacy health workforce retention and growth, policy solutions will be required and efforts that can bring about long-term improvement should be prioritized. This is essential to achieve universal health coverage and the targets of the sustainable development goals for conflict affected areas, as well as to \"leave no one behind\".While the pharmacy workforce is the third largest professional healthcare group worldwide, the pharmacy workforce landscape remains unclear in post-conflict areas in sub-Saharan Africa.","883":"Assessing the effects of early non-pharmaceutical interventions1-5 on COVID-19 spread in the United States is crucial for understanding and planning future control measures to combat the ongoing pandemic6-10. Here we use county-level observations of reported infections and deaths11, in conjunction with human mobility data12 and a metapopulation transmission model13,14, to quantify changes of disease transmission rates in US counties from March 15, 2020 to May 3, 2020. We find significant reductions of the basic reproductive numbers in major metropolitan areas in association with social distancing and other control measures. Counterfactual simulations indicate that, had these same control measures been implemented just 1-2 weeks earlier, a substantial number of cases and deaths could have been averted. Specifically, nationwide, 61.6% [95% CI: 54.6%-67.7%] of reported infections and 55.0% [95% CI: 46.1%-62.2%] of reported deaths as of May 3, 2020 could have been avoided if the same control measures had been implemented just one week earlier. We also examine the effects of delays in re-implementing social distancing following a relaxation of control measures. A longer response time results in a stronger rebound of infections and death. Our findings underscore the importance of early intervention and aggressive response in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.","884":"Under the setting with small effect sizes (i.e., log-Hazard Ratios (logHR)) and homogeneous missingness mechanisms across sites, all imputation methods produced unbiased and more efficient estimates while the complete-case analysis could be biased and inefficient; and under heterogeneous missingness mechanisms, estimates with RF method could have higher efficiency. Estimates from the distributed imputation combined by meta-analysis were similar to those from the imputation using pooled data. When logHRs were large, the SMC imputation algorithm generally performed better than others.To evaluate the performance of imputation for missing baseline covariate data in combination with meta-analysis for time-to-event analysis within DRNs, we compared two parametric algorithms including one approximated linear imputation model (Approx), and one nonlinear substantive model compatible imputation model (SMC), as well as two non-parametric machine learning algorithms including random forest (RF), and classification and regression trees (CART), through simulation studies motivated by a real-world data set.These findings suggest the validity and feasibility of imputation within DRNs in the presence of missing covariate data. The performance of the four imputation algorithms varies with the effect sizes and level of missingness.In distributed research network (DRN) settings, multiple imputation cannot be directly implemented because pooling individual-level data is often not feasible. The performance of multiple imputation in combination with meta-analysis is not well understood within DRNs.","885":"Several countries have implemented lockdowns to control their COVID-19 epidemic. However, questions like \"where\" and \"when\" still require answers. We assessed the impact of national and regional lockdowns considering the French first epidemic wave of COVID-19 as a case study. In a regional lockdown scenario aimed at preventing intensive care units (ICU) saturation, almost all French regions would have had to implement a lockdown within 10\u00a0days and 96% of ICU capacities would have been used. For slowly growing epidemics, with a lower reproduction number, the expected delays between regional lockdowns increase. However, the public health costs associated with these delays tend to grow with time. In a quickly growing pandemic wave, defining the timing of lockdowns at a regional rather than national level delays by a few days the implementation of a nationwide lockdown but leads to substantially higher morbidity, mortality, and stress on the healthcare system.","886":"The Reithrodontomys tenuirostris species group is considered \"the most specialized\" within the genus Reithrodontomys from morphological and ecological perspectives. Previous studies based on molecular data recommended changes in the taxonomy of the group. In particular, R. microdon has been the most taxonomically questioned, with the suggestion that it constitutes a complex of cryptic species. We analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of the R. tenuirostris species group using DNA sequences from the mitochondrial Cytochrome b gene and Intron 7 of the nuclear beta fibrinogen gene. In addition, divergence times were estimated, and possible new taxa delimited with three widely used species delimitation methods. Finally, possible connectivity routes based on shared haplotypes were tested among the R. microdon populations. All species were recovered as monophyletic with the exception of R. microdon, whose individuals were grouped into four different haplogroups, one of which included specimens of R. bakeri. Diversification within the R. tenuirostris species group began about 3 Ma, in the Pleistocene. The bGMYC and STACEY delimitation methods were congruent with each other, delimiting at the species-level each haplogroup within R. microdon, while the mPTP suggested a greater number of species. Moreover, none of the haplogroups showed potential connectivity routes between them, evidencing lack of gene flow. Our results suggest the existence of a higher number of species in the R. tenuirostris group, because we show that there are four species within what is currently recognized as R. microdon.","887":"Research initiatives that engage the public (i.e., community science or citizen science) increasingly provide insights into tick exposures in the United States. However, these data have important caveats, particularly with respect to reported travel history and tick identification. Here, we assessed whether a smartphone application, The Tick App, provides reliable and novel insights into tick exposures across three domains - travel history, broad spatial and temporal patterns of species-specific encounters, and tick identification. During 2019-2021, we received 11,424 tick encounter submissions from across the United States, with nearly all generated in the Midwest and Northeast regions. Encounters were predominantly with human hosts (71%); although one-fourth of ticks were found on animals. Half of the encounters (51%) consisted of self-reported peri\u2011domestic exposures, while 37% consisted of self-reported recreational exposures. Using phone-based location services, we detected differences in travel history outside of the users' county of residence along an urbanicity gradient. Approximately 75% of users from large metropolitan and rural counties had travel out-of-county in the four days prior to tick detection, whereas an estimated 50-60% of users from smaller metropolitan areas did. Furthermore, we generated tick encounter maps for Dermacentor variabilis and Ixodes scapularis that partially accounted for travel history and overall mirrored previously published species distributions. Finally, we evaluated whether a streamlined three-question sequence (on tick size, feeding status, and color) would inform a simple algorithm to optimize image-based tick identification. Visual aides of tick coloration and size engaged and guided users towards species and life stage classification moderately well, with 56% of one-time submitters correctly selecting photos of D. variabilis adults and 76% of frequent-submitters correctly selecting photos of D. variabilis adults. Together, these results indicate the importance of bolstering the use of smartphone applications to engage community scientists and complement other active and passive tick surveillance systems.","888":"Following the rapid dissemination of COVID-19 cases in Colombia in 2020, large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented as national emergencies in most of the country's municipalities, starting with a lockdown on March 20th, 2020. Recently, approaches that combine movement data (measured as the number of commuters between units), metapopulation models to describe disease dynamics subdividing the population into Susceptible-Exposed-Asymptomatic-Infected-Recovered-Diseased and statistical inference algorithms have been pointed as a practical approach to both nowcast and forecast the number of cases and deaths. We used an iterated filtering (IF) framework to estimate the model transmission parameters using the reported data across 281 municipalities from March to late October in locations with more than 50 reported deaths and cases in Colombia. Since the model is high dimensional (6 state variables in every municipality), inference on those parameters is highly non-trivial, so we used an Ensemble-Adjustment-Kalman-Filter (EAKF) to estimate time variable system states and parameters. Our results show the model's ability to capture the characteristics of the outbreak in the country and provide estimates of the epidemiological parameters in time at the national level. Importantly, these estimates could become the base for planning future interventions as well as evaluating the impact of NPIs on the effective reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) and the critical epidemiological parameters, such as the contact rate or the reporting rate. However, our forecast presents some inconsistency as it overestimates the deaths for some locations as Medell\u00edn. Nevertheless, our approach demonstrates that real-time, publicly available ensemble forecasts can provide short-term predictions of reported COVID-19 deaths in Colombia. Therefore, this model can be used as a forecasting tool to evaluate disease dynamics and aid policymakers in infectious outbreak management and control.","889":"We included 39 studies from 8370 retrieved citations. Compared with no intervention, team-based training\/education of physicians significantly increased SIV rates in adult patients: 20.1% [7.5-32.7%; I2 = 0%; two randomized controlled trials (RCTs)] and 13.4% [8.6-18.1%; I2 = 0%; two non-randomized intervention studies (NRS)]. A smaller increase was observed in paediatric patients: 7% (0.1-14%; I2 = 0%; two NRS), and in adult patients with team-based training\/education of physicians and nurses together: 0.9% (0.2-1.5%; I2 = 30.6%; four NRS). One-off provision of guidelines\/information to physicians, and to both physicians and nurses, increased SIV rates in adult patients: 23.8% (15.7-31.8%; I2 = 45.8%; three NRS) and paediatric patients: 24% (8.1-39.9%; I2 = 0%; two NRS), respectively. Use of reminders (prompts) by physicians and nurses slightly increased SIV rates in paediatric patients: 2.3% (0.5-4.2%; I2 = 0%; two RCTs). A larger increase was observed in adult patients: 18.5% (14.8-22.1%; I2 = 0%; two NRS). Evidence from both RCTs and NRS showed significant increases in SIV rates with varied combinations of interventions.To summarize the evidence on interventions on health care providers (physicians\/nurses\/pharmacists) to increase SIV rates.Limited evidence suggests various forms of physicians' and nurses' education and use of reminders may be effective for increasing SIV rates among patients.Seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) rates remain suboptimal in many populations, even in those with universal SIV.We systematically searched\/selected full-text English publications from January 2000 to July 2019 (PROSPERO-CRD42019147199). Our outcome was the difference in SIV rates between patients in intervention and non-intervention groups. We calculated pooled difference using an inverse variance, random-effects model.","890":"SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, emerged in late 2019. The highly contagious B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of concern (VOC) was first identified in October 2020 in India and subsequently disseminated worldwide, later becoming the dominant lineage in the US. Understanding the local transmission dynamics of early SARS-CoV-2 introductions may inform actionable mitigation efforts during subsequent pandemic waves. Yet, despite considerable genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in the US, several gaps remain. Here, we explore the early emergence of the Delta variant in Florida, US using phylogenetic analysis of representative Florida and globally sampled genomes. We find multiple independent introductions into Florida primarily from North America and Europe, with a minority originating from Asia. These introductions led to three distinct clades that demonstrated varying relative rates of transmission and possessed five distinct substitutions that were 3-21 times more prevalent in the Florida sample as compared to the global sample. Our results underscore the benefits of routine viral genomic surveillance to monitor epidemic spread and support the need for more comprehensive genomic epidemiology studies of emerging variants. In addition, we provide a model of epidemic spread of newly emerging VOCs that can inform future public health responses.","891":"We used a static cohort model to compare costs and health effects of four intervention programs to no program and to each other: year-round MI, year-round mAb, seasonal mAb (October to April), and seasonal mAb plus a catch-up program in October. Input parameters were obtained from national registries and literature. Influential input parameters were identified with the expected value of partial perfect information and extensive scenario analyses (including the impact of interventions on wheezing and asthma).From the health care payer perspective, and at a price of \u20ac50 per dose (mAb and MI), seasonal mAb plus catch-up was cost-saving in Scotland, and cost-effective for willingness-to-pay (WTP) values \u2265\u20ac20,000 (England, Finland) or \u20ac30,000 (Denmark) per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for all scenarios considered, except when using ICD-10 based hospitalization data. For the Netherlands, seasonal mAb was preferred (WTP value: \u20ac30,000-\u20ac90,000) for most scenarios. For Veneto region (Italy), either seasonal mAb with or without catch-up or MI was preferred, depending on the scenario and WTP value. From a full societal perspective (including leisure time lost), the seasonal mAb plus catch-up program was cost-saving for all countries except the Netherlands.The choice between a MI or mAb program depends on the level and duration of protection, price, availability, and feasibility of such programs, which should be based on the latest available evidence. Future research should focus on measuring accurately age-specific RSV-attributable hospitalizations in very young children.Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) imposes a substantial burden on pediatric hospital capacity in Europe. Promising prophylactic interventions against RSV including monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and maternal immunizations (MI) are close to licensure. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of potential mAb and MI interventions against RSV in infants, for six European countries.","892":"Automatic segmentation of microvascular structures is a critical step in quantitatively characterizing vessel remodeling and other physiological changes in the dura mater or other tissues. We developed a supervised random forest (RF) classifier for segmenting thin vessel structures using multiscale features based on Hessian, oriented second derivatives, Laplacian of Gaussian and line features. The latter multiscale line detector feature helps in detecting and connecting faint vessel structures that would otherwise be missed. Experimental results on epifluorescence imagery show that the RF approach produces foreground vessel regions that are almost 20 and 25 percent better than Niblack and Otsu threshold-based segmentations respectively.","893":"Despite extensive evidence of work as a key social determinant of hypertension, risk prediction equations incorporating this information are lacking. Such limitations hinder clinicians' ability to tailor patient care and comprehensively address hypertension risk factors. This study examined whether including work characteristics in hypertension risk equations improves their predictive accuracy. Using occupation ratings from the Occupational Information Network database, we measured job demand, job control, and supportiveness of supervisors and coworkers for occupations in the United States economy. We linked these occupation-based measures with the employment status and health data of participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. We fit logistic regression equations to estimate the probability of hypertension onset in five years among CARDIA participants with and without variables reflecting work characteristics. Based on the Harrell's c- and Hosmer-Lemeshow's goodness-of-fit statistics, we found that our logistic regression models that include work characteristics predict hypertension onset more accurately than those that do not incorporate these variables. We also found that the models that rely on occupation-based measures predict hypertension onset more accurately for White than Black participants, even after accounting for a sample size difference. Including other aspects of work, such as workers' experience in the workplace, and other social determinants of health in risk equations may eliminate this discrepancy. Overall, our study showed that clinicians should examine workers' work-related characteristics to tailor hypertension care plans appropriately.","894":"Our results reinforce that genomic surveillance programs are essential for countries to make evidence-driven interventions toward the emergence and circulation of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants.Here, we detect a total of 188 SARS-CoV-2 Pango lineages circulating in Colombia since the pandemic's start. We show that the effective reproduction number oscillated drastically throughout the first two years of the pandemic, with Mu showing the highest transmissibility (Re and growth rate estimation).The emergence of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants has led to surges in cases and the need for global genomic surveillance. While some variants rapidly spread worldwide, other variants only persist nationally. There is a need for more fine-scale analysis to understand transmission dynamics at a country scale. For instance, the Mu variant of interest, also known as lineage B.1.621, was first detected in Colombia and was responsible for a large local wave but only a few sporadic cases elsewhere.To better understand the epidemiology of SARS-Cov-2 variants in Colombia, we used 14,049 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the 32 states of Colombia. We performed Bayesian phylodynamic analyses to estimate the time of variants' introduction, their respective effective reproductive number, and effective population size, and the impact of disease control measures.","895":"Analysing social networks is challenging. Key features of relational data require the use of non-standard statistical methods such as developing system-specific null, or reference, models that randomize one or more components of the observed data. Here we review a variety of randomization procedures that generate reference models for social network analysis. Reference models provide an expectation for hypothesis testing when analysing network data. We outline the key stages in producing an effective reference model and detail four approaches for generating reference distributions: permutation, resampling, sampling from a distribution, and generative models. We highlight when each type of approach would be appropriate and note potential pitfalls for researchers to avoid. Throughout, we illustrate our points with examples from a simulated social system. Our aim is to provide social network researchers with a deeper understanding of analytical approaches to enhance their confidence when tailoring reference models to specific research questions.","896":"Variation in regulatory DNA is thought to drive phenotypic variation, evolution, and disease. Prior studies of regulatory DNA and transcription factors across animal species highlighted a fundamental conundrum: Transcription factor binding domains and cognate binding sites are conserved, while regulatory DNA sequences are not. It remains unclear how conserved transcription factors and dynamic regulatory sites produce conserved expression patterns across species. Here, we explore regulatory DNA variation and its functional consequences within Arabidopsis thaliana, using chromatin accessibility to delineate regulatory DNA genome-wide. Unlike in previous cross-species comparisons, the positional homology of regulatory DNA is maintained among A. thaliana ecotypes and less nucleotide divergence has occurred. Of the \u223c50,000 regulatory sites in A. thaliana, we found that 15% varied in accessibility among ecotypes. Some of these accessibility differences were associated with extensive, previously unannotated sequence variation, encompassing many deletions and ancient hypervariable alleles. Unexpectedly, for the majority of such regulatory sites, nearby gene expression was unaffected. Nevertheless, regulatory sites with high levels of sequence variation and differential chromatin accessibility were the most likely to be associated with differential gene expression. Finally, and most surprising, we found that the vast majority of differentially accessible sites show no underlying sequence variation. We argue that these surprising results highlight the necessity to consider higher-order regulatory context in evaluating regulatory variation and predicting its phenotypic consequences.","897":"We developed an analytical tool based on a full factorial experimental design to assess the potential impact of iMDA in nine high burden sub-Saharan African countries. The simulated iMDA regimen was assumed to be delivered monthly to the targeted population for 3 months each year from 2023 to 2027. A broad set of parameters of ivermectin efficacy, uptake levels and global intervention scenarios were used to predict averted malaria cases and deaths. We then explored the potential averted treatment costs, expected implementation costs and cost-effectiveness ratios under different scenarios.In the scenario where coverage of malaria interventions was maintained at 2018 levels, we found that iMDA in these nine countries has the potential to reverse the predicted growth of malaria burden by averting 20-50 million cases and 36 000-90 000 deaths with an assumed efficacy of 20%. If iMDA has an efficacy of 40%, we predict between 40-99 million cases and 73 000-179 000 deaths will be averted with an estimated net cost per case averted between US$2 and US$7, and net cost per death averted between US$1460 and US$4374.The global progress against malaria has slowed significantly since 2017. As the current malaria control tools seem insufficient to get the trend back on track, several clinical trials are investigating ivermectin mass drug administration (iMDA) as a potential additional vector control tool; however, the health impacts and cost-effectiveness of this new strategy remain unclear.This study measures the potential of iMDA to reverse the increasing number of malaria cases for several sub-Saharan African countries. With additional efficacy information from ongoing clinical trials and country-level modifications, our analytical tool can help determine the appropriate uptake strategies of iMDA by calculating potential marginal gains and costs under different scenarios.","898":"In this household transmission study, index cases with confirmed influenza virus infection and their household contacts were followed for 9-12 days to identify secondary influenza infections. Respiratory swabs were collected at enrollment to identify and quantify bacterial species via high-performance sequencing. Data were analyzed by an individual hazard-based transmission model that was adjusted for age, vaccination, and household size.Previous studies suggest that the nose\/throat microbiome may play an important role in shaping host immunity and modifying the risk of respiratory infection. Our aim is to quantify the association between the nose\/throat microbiome and susceptibility to influenza virus infection.We recruited 115 index cases with influenza A(H3N2) or B infection and 436 household contacts. We estimated that a 10-fold increase in the abundance in Streptococcus spp. and Prevotella salivae was associated with 48% (95% credible interval [CrI], 9-69%) and 25% (95% CrI, 0.5-42%) lower susceptibility to influenza A(H3N2) infection, respectively. In contrast, for influenza B infection, a 10-fold increase in the abundance in Streptococcus vestibularis and Prevotella spp. was associated with 63% (95% CrI, 17-83%) lower and 83% (95% CrI, 15-210%) higher susceptibility, respectively.Susceptibility to influenza infection is associated with the nose\/throat microbiome at the time of exposure. The effects of oligotypes on susceptibility differ between influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses. Our results suggest that microbiome may be a useful predictor of susceptibility, with the implication that microbiome could be modulated to reduce influenza infection risk, should these associations be causal.","899":"We review challenges for economic evaluation relevant to the global HIV response and consider how the practice of cost-effectiveness analysis could integrate approaches and insights from implementation science to enhance the impact and efficiency of HIV investments.Numerous cost-effectiveness analyses have indicated good value for money from a wide array of interventions for treatment and prevention of HIV\/AIDS. There is limited evidence, however, regarding how cost-effectiveness information contributes to better decision-making around investment and action in the global HIV response.In light of signals that cost-effectiveness analyses may be vulnerable to systematic bias toward overly optimistic conclusions, we emphasize two priorities for advancing the field of economic evaluation in HIV\/AIDS and more broadly in global health: (1) systematic reevaluation of the cost-effectiveness literature with reference to ex-post empirical evidence on costs and effects in real-world programs and (2) development and adoption of good-practice guidelines for incorporating implementation and delivery aspects into economic evaluations. Toward the latter aim, we propose an integrative approach that focuses on comparative evaluation of strategies, which specify both technologies\/interventions as well as the delivery platforms, complementary interventions, and actions needed to increase coverage, quality, and uptake of those technologies\/interventions. Specific recommendations draw on several existing implementation science models that provide systematic frameworks for understanding implementation barriers and enablers, designing and choosing specific implementation and policy actions, and evaluating outcomes.These preliminary steps aimed at bridging the divide between economic evaluation and implementation science can help to advance the practice of economic evaluation toward a science of comparative strategy evaluation.","900":"The Trachoma Control Program in Amhara region, Ethiopia, scaled up the surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness, and environmental improvement (SAFE) strategy in all districts starting in 2007. Despite these efforts, many districts still require additional years of SAFE. In 2017, four districts were selected for the assessment of antibody responses against Chlamydia trachomatis antigens and C. trachomatis infection to better understand transmission. Districts with differing endemicity were chosen, whereby one had a previous trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) prevalence of \u2265 30% (Andabet), one had a prevalence between 10% and 29.9% (Dera), one had a prevalence between 5% and 10% (Woreta town), and one had a previous TF prevalence of < 5% (Alefa) and had not received antibiotic intervention for 2 years. Survey teams assessed trachoma clinical signs and took conjunctival swabs and dried blood spots (DBS) to measure infection and antibody responses. Trachomatous inflammation-follicular prevalence among children aged 1-9 years was 37.0% (95% CI: 31.1-43.3) for Andabet, 14.7% (95% CI: 10.0-20.5) for Dera, and < 5% for Woreta town and Alefa. Chlamydia trachomatis infection was only detected in Andabet (11.3%). Within these districts, 2,195 children provided DBS. The prevalence of antibody responses to the antigen Pgp3 was 36.9% (95% CI: 29.0-45.6%) for Andabet, 11.3% (95% CI: 5.9-20.6%) for Dera, and < 5% for Woreta town and Alefa. Seroconversion rate for Pgp3 in Andabet was 0.094 (95% CI: 0.069-0.128) events per year. In Andabet district, where SAFE implementation has occurred for 11 years, the antibody data support the finding of persistently high levels of trachoma transmission.","901":"A stay-at-home social distancing mandate is a key nonpharmacological measure to reduce the transmission rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), but a high rate of adherence is needed.This cross-sectional study used daily travel distance and home dwell time derived from millions of anonymous mobile phone location data from March 11 to April 10, 2020, provided by the Descartes Labs and SafeGraph to quantify the degree to which social distancing mandates were followed in the 50 US states and District of Columbia and the association of mobility changes with rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.Data from more than 45 million anonymous mobile phone devices were analyzed. The correlation between the COVID-19 increase rate and travel distance decrease rate was -0.586 (95% CI, -0.742 to -0.370) and the correlation between COVID-19 increase rate and home dwell time increase rate was 0.526 (95% CI, 0.293 to 0.700). Increases in state-specific doubling time of total cases ranged from 1.0 to 6.9 days (median [interquartile range], 2.7 [2.3-3.3] days) before stay-at-home orders were enacted to 3.7 to 30.3 days (median [interquartile range], 6.0 [4.8-7.1] days) after stay-at-home social distancing orders were put in place, consistent with pandemic modeling results.To examine the association between the rate of human mobility changes and the rate of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.These findings suggest that stay-at-home social distancing mandates, when they were followed by measurable mobility changes, were associated with reduction in COVID-19 spread. These results come at a particularly critical period when US states are beginning to relax social distancing policies and reopen their economies. These findings support the efficacy of social distancing and could help inform future implementation of social distancing policies should they need to be reinstated during later periods of COVID-19 reemergence.The main outcome was the association of state-specific rates of COVID-19 confirmed cases with the change rates of median travel distance and median home dwell time of anonymous mobile phone users. The increase rates are measured by the exponent in curve fitting of the COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases, while the mobility change (increase or decrease) rates were measured by the slope coefficient in curve fitting of median travel distance and median home dwell time for each state.State-level stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic.","902":"Information manipulation is widespread in today's media environment. Online networks have disrupted the gatekeeping role of traditional media by allowing various actors to influence the public agenda; they have also allowed automated accounts (or bots) to blend with human activity in the flow of information. Here, we assess the impact that bots had on the dissemination of content during two contentious political events that evolved in real time on social media. We focus on events of heightened political tension because they are particularly susceptible to information campaigns designed to mislead or exacerbate conflict. We compare the visibility of bots with human accounts, verified accounts, and mainstream news outlets. Our analyses combine millions of posts from a popular microblogging platform with web-tracking data collected from two different countries and timeframes. We employ tools from network science, natural language processing, and machine learning to analyze the diffusion structure, the content of the messages diffused, and the actors behind those messages as the political events unfolded. We show that verified accounts are significantly more visible than unverified bots in the coverage of the events but also that bots attract more attention than human accounts. Our findings highlight that social media and the web are very different news ecosystems in terms of prevalent news sources and that both humans and bots contribute to generate discrepancy in news visibility with their activity.","903":"In repeated behaviours such as those of feeding and reproduction, past experiences can inform future behaviour. By altering their behaviour in response to environmental stimuli, insects in highly variable landscapes can tailor their behaviour to their particular environment. In particular, female mosquitoes may benefit from plasticity in their choice of egg-laying site as these sites are often temporally variable and clustered. The opportunity to adapt egg-laying behaviour to past experience also exists for mosquito populations as females typically lay eggs multiple times throughout their lives. Whether experience and age affect egg-laying (or oviposition) behaviour in the mosquito Stegomyia aegypti (=Aedes aegypti) (Diptera: Culicidae) was assessed using a wind tunnel. Initially, gravid mosquitoes were provided with a cup containing either repellent or well water. After ovipositing in these cups, the mosquitoes were blood-fed and introduced into a wind tunnel. In this wind tunnel, an oviposition cup containing repellent was placed in the immediate vicinity of the gravid mosquitoes. A cup containing well water was placed at the opposite end of the tunnel so that if the females flew across the chamber, they encountered the well water cup, in which they readily laid eggs. Mosquitoes previously exposed to repellent cups became significantly more likely to later lay eggs in repellent cups, suggesting that previous experience with suboptimal oviposition sites informs mosquitoes of the characteristics of nearby oviposition sites. These results provide further evidence that mosquitoes modify behaviour in response to environmental information and are demonstrated in a vector species in which behavioural plasticity may be ecologically and epidemiologically meaningful. ","904":"Norovirus is the most frequently occurring cause of community-acquired acute gastroenteritis in people of all ages. It is also one of the most frequent causes of outbreaks in healthcare settings, affecting both long-term care facilities and acute care hospitals. Whereas norovirus gastroenteritis is typically mild and resolves without medical attention, healthcare-associated infections often affect vulnerable populations, resulting in severe infections and disruption of healthcare services. Globally, most norovirus outbreaks in hospitals and residential care institutions are associated with genogroup II type 4 (GII.4) strains. Recent data demonstrate that excess mortality occurs during outbreak periods in healthcare facilities. Nosocomial outbreaks can result in large economic and societal costs. Current control measures for norovirus are largely based on general infection control principles, and treatment is mainly supportive and non-specific.

Recent data-intensive analysis has shown that, while ecoregions do delineate biotic communities, how distinct they are from one another varies considerably across regions and taxa. Given their central importance to global models of the earth system and to the development of conservation plans, it is key to understand in what regions, and for which taxa, ecoregion classification schemes best describe the underlying variability in biological communities.","907":"Patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance between January 2015 and April 2020 were retrospectively included in this study. Baseline electronic health record data, including clinical demographic information, laboratory data, and electrocardiographic information, were collected. Short-axis non-contrast cine images of the whole heart were acquired to estimate the cardiac function parameters and the motion features of the left ventricle. Model accuracy was evaluated using the Harrell's concordance index. All patients were followed up for major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), and survival prediction was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves.A total of 329 patients were evaluated (age 54\u2009\u00b1\u200914\u00a0years; men, 254) in this study. During a median follow-up period of 1041\u00a0days, 62 patients experienced MACEs and their median survival time was 495\u00a0days. When compared with conventional Cox hazard prediction models, deep learning models showed better survival prediction performance. Multi-data denoising autoencoder (DAE) model reached the concordance index of 0.8546 (95% CI: 0.7902-0.8883). Furthermore, when divided into phenogroups, the multi-data DAE model could significantly discriminate between the survival outcomes of the high-risk and low-risk groups compared with other models (p\u2009<\u20090.001).The proposed deep learning (DL) model based on non-contrast cardiac cine magnetic resonance imaging could independently predict the outcome of patients with HFrEF and showed better prediction efficiency than conventional methods.The proposed multi-source deep learning model based on cardiac magnetic resonance enables survival prediction in patients with heart failure.\u2022 A multi-source deep learning model based on non-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) cine images was built to make robust survival prediction in patients with heart failure. \u2022 The ground truth definition contains electronic health record data as well as DL-based motion data, and cardiac motion information is extracted by optical flow method from non-contrast CMR cine images. \u2022 The DL-based model exhibits better prognostic value and stratification performance when compared with conventional prediction models and could aid in the risk stratification in patients with HF.To evaluate the performance of a deep learning-based multi-source model for survival prediction and risk stratification in patients with heart failure.","908":"We used a stochastic Poisson process to project the number of primary and revision arthroplasties and SSIs. Primary arthroplasty rates were calculated using annual estimates of hip and knee arthroplasty stratified by age and gender from the 2012-2014 Nationwide Inpatient Sample and standardized by census population data. Revision rates, dependent on time from primary procedure, were obtained from published literature and were uniformly applied for all ages and genders. Stratified complex SSI rates for arthroplasties were obtained from 2012-2015 National Healthcare Safety Network data. To evaluate the possible impact of prevention measures, we recalculated the projections with an SSI rate reduced by 30%, the national target established by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).As the US population ages, the number of hip and knee arthroplasties is expected to increase. Because surgical site infections (SSIs) following these procedures contribute substantial morbidity, mortality, and costs, we projected SSIs expected to occur from 2020 through 2030.Given current SSI rates, we project that complex SSI burden for primary and revision arthroplasty may increase due to an aging population. Reducing the SSI rate to the national HHS target could prevent 23,000 SSIs and reduce subsequent morbidity, mortality, and Medicare costs.Without a reduction in SSI rates, we projected an increase in complex SSIs following hip and knee arthroplasty of 14% between 2020 and 2030. We projected a total burden of 77,653 SSIs; however, meeting the 30% rate reduction could prevent 23,297 of these SSIs.","909":"Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne disease in the United States, and the number of cases reported each year continues to rise. The complex nature of the relationships between the pathogen (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto), the tick vector (Ixodes scapularis Say), multiple vertebrate hosts, and numerous environmental factors creates challenges for understanding and predicting tick population and pathogen transmission dynamics. LYMESIM is a mechanistic model developed in the late 1990s to simulate the life-history of I. scapularis and transmission dynamics of B. burgdorferi s.s. Here we present LYMESIM 2.0, a modernized version of LYMESIM, that includes several modifications to enhance the biological realism of the model and to generate outcomes that are more readily measured under field conditions. The model is tested for three geographically distinct locations in New York, Minnesota, and Virginia. Model-simulated timing and densities of questing nymphs, infected nymphs, and abundances of nymphs feeding on hosts are consistent with field observations and reports for these locations. Sensitivity analysis highlighted the importance of temperature in host finding for the density of nymphs, the importance of transmission from small mammals to ticks on the density of infected nymphs, and temperature-related tick survival for both density of nymphs and infected nymphs. A key challenge for accurate modeling of these metrics is the need for regionally representative inputs for host populations and their fluctuations. LYMESIM 2.0 is a useful public health tool that downstream can be used to evaluate tick control interventions and can be adapted for other ticks and pathogens.","910":": These data demonstrate the challenges that remain to the Roma population in Romania, and also point to the myriad of ways in which all rural Romanians, regardless of ethnicity, are encountering hardship.

Constraints in vaccine supply and distribution capacity, together with the rise of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, have sparked a policy debate on whether to vaccinate more individuals with the first dose of available vaccines and delay the second dose, or to continue with the recommended two-dose series as tested in clinical trials. We developed an agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission to compare the impact of these two vaccination strategies, while varying the temporal waning of vaccine efficacy against disease following the first dose, vaccine efficacy against infection, and the level of pre-existing immunity in the population. Our results show that for Moderna vaccines with 80% efficacy following the first dose, a delay of 9-12 weeks could enhance the program effectiveness and prevent additional infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, compared to a 4-week interval between the doses. However, for Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines with demonstrated efficacy of 52% after the first dose, there was no clear advantage for delaying the second dose beyond the 3-week tested schedule, unless the efficacy of the first dose did not wane over time. Our findings underscore the importance of quantifying the durability of vaccine-induced protection after the first dose as well as vaccine efficacy against infection in order to determine the optimal time interval between the two doses.","913":"Geographic pattern of dengue fever is changing due to the global environmental and climate changes in the 21st century. Evidence of community's knowledge, mosquito bite patterns and protective behavior practices in non-endemic regions is limited. This study examined the knowledge of dengue, mosquito bite patterns, protective behavior practices and their associated factors in Hong Kong, a non-endemic subtropical city. A population-based random telephone survey (n = 590) was conducted three weeks after the government announcement of a local dengue outbreak in August 2018. Sociodemographic status, awareness, knowledge, protective measures, bite patterns of mosquito were collected. Results indicated high level of community awareness of the local outbreak (95.2%), symptom identification (84.0%) and adoption of at least one mosquito protective measures (nearly 80%). About 40% of respondents reported that they were bitten by mosquitoes during the study period, a high mosquito season in Hong Kong. Mosquito bites were prevalent near grassy area (63.4%), at home (42.6%) and at public transportation waiting spots (39.6%). Younger people (< 25 years old), female, those who lived on lower floors (\u2264the 6th) and near grassy area were at higher risk of mosquito bites at home. Respondents perceived higher threat of dengue to society were more likely to practice mosquito prevention. While residential factors affected their indoor prevention, other socio-demographic factors affected the outdoor prevention. Practicing prevention behaviors were associated with self-reported mosquito bite at home. Furthermore, the general prevention uptake rate unchanged after the announcement of local dengue outbreak. Although the uptake rate of protective measures during August was high, 40% participants reported they were bitten. Also public locations are more common area for bites. which suggested stronger mosquito prevention and control on public environments and more personal protective behaviors should be advocated.","914":"Vector-borne diseases remain a significant public health threat in many regions of the world. Traditional vector surveillance and control methods have relied on active and passive surveillance programs, which are often costly and time-consuming. New internet-based vector surveillance systems have shown promise in removing some of the cost and labor burden from health authorities. We developed and evaluated the effectiveness of a new internet-based surveillance system, \"AlertaChirimacha\", for detecting Triatoma infestans (known locally by its Quechua name, Chirimacha), the Chagas disease vector, in the city of Arequipa, Peru. In the first 26 months post-implementation, AlertaChirimacha received 206 reports of residents suspecting or fearing triatomines in their homes or neighborhoods, of which we confirmed, through pictures or inspections, 11 (5.3%) to be Triatoma infestans. After microscopic examination, none of the specimens collected were infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. AlertaChirimacha received 57% more confirmed reports than the traditional surveillance system and detected 10% more infested houses than active and passive surveillance approaches combined. Through in-depth interviews we evaluate the reach, bilateral engagement, and response promptness and efficiency of AlertaChirimacha. Our study highlights the potential of internet-based vector surveillance systems, such as AlertaChirimacha, to improve vector surveillance and control efforts in resource-limited settings. This approach could decrease the cost and time horizon for the elimination of vector-mediated Chagas disease in the region.","915":"The number of secondary cases, i.e. the number of new infections generated by an infectious individual, is an important parameter for the control of infectious diseases. When individual variation in disease transmission is present, like for COVID-19, the distribution of the number of secondary cases is skewed and often modeled using a negative binomial distribution. However, this may not always be the best distribution to describe the underlying transmission process. We propose the use of three other offspring distributions to quantify heterogeneity in transmission, and we assess the possible bias in estimates of the mean and variance of this distribution when the data generating distribution is different from the one used for inference. We also analyze COVID-19 data from Hong Kong, India, and Rwanda, and quantify the proportion of cases responsible for 80% of transmission, [Formula: see text], while acknowledging the variation arising from the assumed offspring distribution. In a simulation study, we find that variance estimates may be biased when there is a substantial amount of heterogeneity, and that selection of the most accurate distribution from a set of distributions is important. In addition we find that the number of secondary cases for two of the three COVID-19 datasets is better described by a Poisson-lognormal distribution.","916":"Mathematical models have suggested that spatially-targeted screening interventions for tuberculosis may efficiently accelerate disease control, but empirical data supporting these findings are limited. Previous models demonstrating substantial impacts of these interventions have typically simulated large-scale screening efforts and have not attempted to capture the spatial distribution of tuberculosis in households and communities at a high resolution. Here, we calibrate an individual-based model to the locations of case notifications in one district of Lima, Peru. We estimate the incremental efficiency and impact of a spatially-targeted interventions used in combination with household contact tracing (HHCT). Our analysis reveals that HHCT is relatively efficient with a median of 40 (Interquartile Range: 31.7 to 49.9) household contacts required to be screened to detect a single case of active tuberculosis. However, HHCT has limited population impact, producing a median incidence reduction of only 3.7% (Interquartile Range: 5.8% to 1.9%) over 5 years. In comparison, spatially targeted screening (which we modeled as active case finding within high tuberculosis prevalence areas 100 m2 grid cell) is far less efficient, requiring evaluation of \u224812 times the number of individuals as HHCT to find a single individual with active tuberculosis. Furthermore, the addition of the spatially targeted screening effort produced only modest additional reductions in tuberculosis incidence over the 5 year period (\u22481.3%) in tuberculosis incidence. In summary, we found that HHCT is an efficient approach for tuberculosis case finding, but has limited population impact. Other screening approaches which target areas of high tuberculosis prevalence are less efficient, and may have limited impact unless very large numbers of individuals can be screened.","917":"Background: Breast cancer developed at a young age (\u226445 years) is hypothesized to have unique biology; however, findings in this field are controversial. Methods: We compared the whole transcriptomic profile of young vs. old-age breast cancer using DNA microarray. RNA was extracted from 13 fresh estrogen receptor (ER)-positive primary breast cancer tissues of untreated patients (7 = young age \u226445 years and 6 = old age \u226555 years). In silico validation for the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by young-age patients was conducted using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Next, we analyzed the protein expression encoded by two of the significantly down-regulated genes by young-age patients, Glycine N-acyltransferase-like 1 (GLYATL-1) and Ran-binding protein 3 like (RANBP3L), using immunohistochemical analysis in an independent cohort of 56 and 74 ER-positive pre-therapeutic primary breast cancer tissues, respectively. Results: 12 genes were significantly differentially expressed by young-age breast cancers (fold change >2 or <2- with FDR p-value < 0.05). TCGA data confirmed the differential expression of six genes. Protein expression analysis of GLYATL-1 and RANBP3L did not show heterogeneous expression between young and old-age breast cancer tissues. Loss of expression of GLYATL-1 was significantly (p-value 0.005) associated with positive lymph node status. Higher expression of RANBP3L was significantly associated with breast cancers with lower histopathological grades (p-value 0.038). Conclusions: At the transcriptomic level, breast cancer developed in young and old age patients seems homogenous. The variation in the transcriptomic profiles can be attributed to the other clinicopathological characteristics rather than the age of the patient.","918":"In this study, we found that maternal GBS vaccination could have a large impact on infant morbidity and mortality. Globally, a GBS maternal vaccine at reasonable prices is likely to be a cost-effective intervention.Group B Streptococcus (GBS) can cause invasive disease (iGBS) in young infants, typically presenting as sepsis or meningitis, and is also associated with stillbirth and preterm birth. GBS vaccines are under development, but their potential health impact and cost-effectiveness have not been assessed globally.We assessed the health impact and value (using net monetary benefit (NMB), which measures both health and economic effects of vaccination into monetary units) of GBS maternal vaccination in an annual cohort of 140 million pregnant women across 183 countries in 2020. Our analysis uses a decision tree model, incorporating risks of GBS-related health outcomes from an existing Bayesian disease burden model. We extrapolated country-specific GBS-related healthcare costs using data from a previous systematic review and calculated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost due to infant mortality and long-term disability. We assumed 80% vaccine efficacy against iGBS and stillbirth, following the WHO Preferred Product Characteristics, and coverage based on the proportion of pregnant women receiving at least 4 antenatal visits. One dose was assumed to cost $50 in high-income countries, $15 in upper-middle income countries, and $3.50 in low-\/lower-middle-income countries. We estimated NMB using alternative normative assumptions that may be adopted by policymakers. Vaccinating pregnant women could avert 127,000 (95% uncertainty range 63,300 to 248,000) early-onset and 87,300 (38,100 to 209,000) late-onset infant iGBS cases, 31,100 deaths (14,400 to 66,400), 17,900 (6,380 to 49,900) cases of moderate and severe neurodevelopmental impairment, and 23,000 (10,000 to 56,400) stillbirths. A vaccine effective against GBS-associated prematurity might also avert 185,000 (13,500 to 407,000) preterm births. Globally, a 1-dose vaccine programme could cost $1.7 billion but save $385 million in healthcare costs. Estimated global NMB ranged from $1.1 billion ($-0.2 to 3.8 billion) under the least favourable normative assumptions to $17 billion ($9.1 to 31 billion) under the most favourable normative assumptions. The main limitation of our analysis was the scarcity of data to inform some of the model parameters such as those governing health-related quality of life and long-term costs from disability, and how these parameters may vary across country contexts.","919":"Important signs and symptoms for the new prediction rule were found by combining random forest and logistic regression modelling. Performance to predict poor outcome in acute cough patients was compared with that of existing prediction rules, using the models' area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), and any improvement obtained by including additional test results (C-reactive protein [CRP], blood urea nitrogen [BUN], chest radiography, or aetiology) was evaluated using the same methodology.The new prediction rule, included the baseline Risk of poor outcome, Interference with daily activities, number of years stopped Smoking (> or  or <85 mmHg) (RISSC85). Though performance of RISSC85 was moderate (sensitivity 62%, specificity 59%, positive predictive value 27%, negative predictive value 86%, AUC 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.61 to 0.67), it outperformed all existing prediction rules used today (highest AUC 0.53, 95% CI = 0.51 to 0.56), and could not be significantly improved by including additional test results (highest AUC 0.64, 95% CI = 0.62 to 0.68).Accurate prediction of the course of an acute cough episode could curb antibiotic overprescribing, but is still a major challenge in primary care.The authors set out to develop a new prediction rule for poor outcome (re-consultation with new or worsened symptoms, or hospital admission) in adults presenting to primary care with acute cough.Data were collected from 2604 adults presenting to primary care with acute cough or symptoms suggestive of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) within the Genomics to combat Resistance against Antibiotics in Community-acquired LRTI in Europe (GRACE; www.grace-lrti.org) Network of Excellence.The new prediction rule outperforms all existing alternatives in predicting poor outcome in adult patients presenting to primary care with acute cough and could not be improved by including additional test results.","920":"How components of the distributed brain networks that support cognition participate in typical functioning remains a largely unanswered question. An important subgroup of regions in the larger network are connector hubs, which are areas that are highly connected to several other functionally-specialized sets of regions, and are likely important for sensorimotor integration. The present study attempts to characterize connector hubs involved in typical expressive language functioning using a data-driven, multimodal, full multilayer MEG connectivity-based pipeline. Twelve adolescents, 16-18 years of age (5 male) participated in this study. Participants underwent MEG scanning during a verb generation task. MEG and structural connectivity were calculated at the whole-brain level. Amplitude-amplitude coupling (AAC) was used to compute functional connections both within and between discrete frequency bins. AAC values were then multiplied by a binary structural connectivity matrix, then entered into full multilayer network analysis. Initially, hubs were defined based on multilayer versatility and subsequently re-ranked by a novel measure called delta centrality on interconnectedness (DCI). DCI is defined as the percent change in inter-frequency interconnectedness after removal of a hub. We resolved regions that are important for between-frequency communication among other areas during expressive language, with several potential theoretical and clinical applications that can be generalized to other cognitive domains. Our multilayer, data-driven framework captures nonlinear connections that span across scales that are often missed in conventional analyses. The present study suggests that crucial hubs may be conduits for inter-frequency communication between action and perception systems that are crucial for typical functioning.","921":"To assist communities who suffered from hurricane-inflicted damages, emergency responders may monitor social media messages. We present a case-study using the event of Hurricane Matthew to analyze the results of an imputation method for the location of Twitter users who follow school and school districts in Georgia, USA.Tweets related to Hurricane Matthew were analyzed by content analysis with latent Dirichlet allocation models and sentiment analysis to identify needs and sentiment changes over time. A hurdle regression model was applied to study the association between retweet frequency and content analysis topics.Social media data can be used to detect and evaluate damages of communities affected by natural disasters and identify users' needs in at-risk areas before the event takes place to aid during the preparedness phases.Users residing in counties affected by Hurricane Matthew posted tweets related to preparedness (n = 171; 16%), awareness (n = 407; 38%), call-for-action or help (n = 206; 19%), and evacuations (n = 93; 9%), with mostly a negative sentiment during the preparedness and response phase. Tweets posted in the hurricane path during the preparedness and response phase were less likely to be retweeted than those outside the path (adjusted odds ratio: 0.95; 95% confidence interval: 0.75, 1.19).","922":"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) emerged in Colombia in 2014 into a population presumed fully susceptible. This resulted in a quick and intense spread across Colombia, resulting in an epidemic that affected an estimated 450,000 people. The reported Colombian cases accounted for over 49% of all the cases reported to the PAHO. Eco-environmental factors are known to be associated with the spread of arboviruses such as CHIKV, and likely contribute to the differences in transmission profiles that were observed across several municipalities. To determine the association of eco-environmental factors and CHIKV, the basic reproduction number (R0) in 85 municipalities, which accounted for 65.6% of reported CHIKV cases in Colombia, was estimated. Estimates of R0 ranged from 1 to 9, where over 76% of municipalities had R0 values between 1 and 2. When we looked at the distribution of R0, the cumulative proportions were 20% with R0>2, 14% with R0>3, and 9% with R0>4. Next, we determined that there were different patterns of correlation between environmental and\/or ecological variables and R0 when we considered different R0 lower-thresholds. Broadly, we found that temperature-related variables are significantly and positively correlated to R0 regardless of the lower threshold, while other variables like duration of outbreak and size of the urban area are inversely related to R0. Specifically, we conclude that high values of temperature-related variables where R0 > 1 will result in a fast growth of cases in a shorter time period (with faster cessation of outbreak transmission) but will result overall in a fewer total cases compared to outbreak areas (R0 > 1, but classified as lower). Thus, in the absence of vector control, a less explosive outbreak may be more advantageous for the virus in terms of transmission.","923":", and the expansion of these genera is well documented. There is an urgent need to study vector-borne diseases in response to climate change and to produce a generalizable approach capable of generating risk maps and forecasting outbreaks. Here, we provide a strategy for coupling climate and epidemiological models for zoonotic infectious diseases. We discuss the complexity and challenges of data and model fusion, baseline requirements for data, and animal and human population movement. Disease forecasting needs significant investment to build the infrastructure necessary to collect data about the environment, vectors, and hosts at all spatial and temporal resolutions. These investments can contribute to building a modeling community around the globe to support public health officials so as to reduce disease burden through forecasts with quantified uncertainty.","924":"We aimed to assess the role of different setting and activities in acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection.In this nationwide case-control study, cases were SARS-CoV-2 infected adults recruited between 27 October and 30 November 2020.

The relation between genital and oral infections and serum antibodies can help explain the natural history and epidemiology of HPV.We analyzed HPV data from NHANES derived from self-collected vaginal swabs (women ages 14-59, 2003-12), oral rinses (men and women 14-69, 2009-12), and serum (men and women 14-59, 2003-10).There are complex patterns in HPV prevalence trends and type-concordance across infection sites and serum antibodies. A multisite sampling scheme is needed to better understand the epidemiology and natural history of HPV.Type-concordance of cervicogenital and oral infections in women was found to vary widely by age. Prevalence of oral infections with type-concordant antibodies was low but varied by sex: 0.2 % (95 % CI 0.0-0.8) for women vs 0.8 % (95 % CI 0.4-1.3) for men. Vaccination was associated with a reduced risk of cervicogenital infection for vaccine genotypes among ages 14-17 (0.2 (95 % CI 0.1-0.8)) and 18-24 (0.2 (95 % CI 0.1-0.3). Seroprevalence trends in women showed a dramatic increase for recent birth cohorts, likely due to vaccination. By contrast, trends for men remained relatively constant. Age-specific cervicogenital prevalence showed a consistent peak in the late teens and twenties. Relative cervicogenital prevalence has largely been decreasing since the 1940-50 birth cohort.","928":"The statistical estimate of influenza incidence among all ages ranged from 3.0%-11.3% among seasons, with median values of 8.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.3%-9.7%) for all ages, 9.3% (95% CI, 8.2%-11.1%) for children <18 years, and 8.9% (95% CI, 8.2%-9.9%) for adults 18-64 years. Corresponding values for the meta-analysis were 7.1% (95% CI, 6.1%-8.1%) for all ages, 8.7% (95% CI, 6.6%-10.5%) for children, and 5.1% (95% CI, 3.6%-6.6%) for adults.The 2 approaches produced comparable results for children and persons of all ages. The statistical estimates are more versatile and permit estimation of season-to-season variation. During 2010-2016, the incidence of symptomatic influenza among vaccinated and unvaccinated US residents, including both medically attended and nonattended infections, was approximately 8% and varied from 3% to 11% among seasons.The seasonal incidence of influenza is often approximated as 5%-20%.We used 2 methods to estimate the seasonal incidence of symptomatic influenza in the United States. First, we made a statistical estimate extrapolated from influenza-associated hospitalization rates for 2010-2011 to 2015-2016, collected as part of national surveillance, covering approximately 9% of the United States, and including the existing mix of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons. Second, we performed a literature search and meta-analysis of published manuscripts that followed cohorts of subjects during 1996-2016 to detect laboratory-confirmed symptomatic influenza among unvaccinated persons; we adjusted this result to the US median vaccination coverage and effectiveness during 2010-2016.","929":"Gonorrhea incidence is increasing rapidly in many countries, whilst antibiotic resistance is making treatment more difficult. Combined with evidence that MeNZB and Bexsero meningococcal vaccines are likely partially-protective against gonorrhea, this has renewed interest in a gonococcal vaccine, and several candidates are in development. Key questions are how protective a vaccine needs to be, how long protection needs to last, and how should it be targeted. We assessed vaccination's potential impact, and the feasibility of achieving WHO's target 90% reduction in gonorrhea incidence 2016-2030, by comparing realistic vaccination strategies under a range of scenarios of vaccine efficacy and duration of protection, and emergence of extensively-resistant gonorrhea.We developed a stochastic transmission-dynamic model, incorporating asymptomatic and symptomatic infection and heterogeneous sexual behavior in men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM). We used data from England, which has a comprehensive, consistent nationwide surveillance system. Using particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods we fitted the model to gonorrhea incidence in 2008-17, and then used Bayesian forecasting to examine an extensive range of scenarios.Even in the worst-case scenario of untreatable infection emerging, the WHO target is achievable if all MSM attending sexual health clinics receive a vaccine offering \u226552% protection for \u22656 years. A vaccine conferring 31% protection (as estimated for MeNZB) for 2-4 years, could reduce incidence in 2030 by 45% in the worst-case scenario, and by 75% if >70% of resistant gonorrhea remains treatable.Even a partially-protective vaccine, delivered through a realistic targeting strategy, could substantially reduce gonorrhea incidence, despite antibiotic resistance.","930":"To assess the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on seasonal respiratory viruses, absolute case counts and viral reproductive rates from 2019-2020 were compared against previous seasons. Our findings suggest that the public health measures implemented to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission significantly reduced the transmission of other respiratory viruses.","931":"During infectious disease outbreaks, health agencies often share text-based information about cases and deaths. This information is rarely machine-readable, thus creating challenges for outbreak researchers. Here, we introduce a generalizable data assembly algorithm that automatically curates text-based, outbreak-related information and demonstrate its performance across 3 outbreaks. After developing an algorithm with regular expressions, we automatically curated data from health agencies via 3 information sources: formal reports, email newsletters, and Twitter. A validation data set was also curated manually for each outbreak, and an implementation process was presented for application to future outbreaks. When compared against the validation data sets, the overall cumulative missingness and misidentification of the algorithmically curated data were \u22642% and \u22641%, respectively, for all 3 outbreaks. Within the context of outbreak research, our work successfully addresses the need for generalizable tools that can transform text-based information into machine-readable data across varied information sources and infectious diseases.","932":"The MMR in the Colombian municipalities was associated significantly with the multidimensional poverty (relative ratio of MMR: 3.52; CI 95%: 1.09-11.38). This association was stronger in municipalities from departments with the highest poverty (relative ratio of MMR: 7.14; CI 95%: 2.01-25.35). Additionally, the MMR at municipal level was marginally associated with municipally health insurance coverage (relative ratio of MMR: 0.99; CI 95%: 0.98-1.00), and significantly with transparency index at departmental level (relative ratio of MMR: 0.98; CI 95%: 0.97-0.99).Maternal mortality reduction is a Millennium Development Goal. In Colombia, there is a large disparity in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) between and into departments (states) and also between municipalities. We examined socioeconomics variables at the municipal and departmental levels which could be associated to the municipal maternal mortality in Colombia.Poverty and transparency in a contextual level were associated with the increase of the municipal MMR in Colombia. The results of this study are useful evidence for informing the public policies discussion and formulation processes with a differential approach.A multilevel ecology study was carried out using different national data sources in Colombia. The outcome variable was the MMR at municipal level in 2011 with multidimensional poverty at municipal and department level as the principal independent variables and other measures of the social and economic characteristics at municipal and departmental level were also considered explicative variables (overall fertility municipal rate, percentage of local rural population, health insurance coverage, per capita territorial participation allocated to the health sector, transparency index and Gini coefficient). The association between MMR and socioeconomic contextual conditions at municipal and departmental level was assessed using a multilevel Poisson regression model.","933":"SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have emerged from an animal reservoir; however, the frequency of and risk factors for inter-species transmission remain unclear. We carried out a community-based study of pets in households with one or more confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Among 119 dogs and 57 cats with completed surveys, clinical signs consistent with SARS-CoV-2 were reported in 20 dogs (21%) and 19 cats (39%). Out of 81 dogs and 32 cats sampled for testing, 40% of dogs and 43% of cats were seropositive, and 5% of dogs and 8% of cats were PCR positive; this discordance may be due to delays in sampling. Respondents commonly reported close human-animal contact and willingness to take measures to prevent transmission to their pets. Reported preventative measures showed a slightly protective trend for both illness and seropositivity in pets, while sharing of beds and bowls had slight harmful effects.","934":"Population contact patterns fundamentally determine the spread of directly transmitted airborne pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. Reliable quantitative estimates of contact patterns are therefore critical to modeling and reducing the spread of directly transmitted infectious diseases and to assessing the effectiveness of interventions intended to limit risky contacts. While many countries have used surveys and contact diaries to collect national-level contact data, local-level estimates of age-specific contact patterns remain rare. Yet, these local-level data are critical since disease dynamics and public health policy typically vary by geography. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a flexible model that can estimate age-specific contact patterns at the subnational level by combining national-level interpersonal contact data with other locality-specific data sources using multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP). We estimate daily contact matrices for all 50 US states and Washington DC from April 2020 to May 2021 using national contact data from the US. Our results reveal important state-level heterogeneities in levels and trends of contacts across the US over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, with implications for the spread of respiratory diseases.","935":"Regarding the individual-level risk model, the variance-based sensitivity analysis indicated that the uncertainty in the estimated risk was attributed to two variables: the number of close contacts and the viral transmission probability. Next, the disease transmission probability was computed using a multivariate logistic regression applied for a cross-sectional HCP data in the UK, with the 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of 78.23%. Combined with the previous result, we further validated the individual infection risk model by considering six occupations in the U.S. Department of Labor O*Net database. The occupation-specific risk evaluation suggested that the registered nurses, medical assistants, and respiratory therapists were the highest-risk occupations. For the population-level risk model validation, the infection risk in Texas and California was estimated, in which the infection risk in Texas was lower than that in California. This can be explained by California's higher patient load for each HCP per day and lower personal protective equipment (PPE) sufficiency level.The accurate estimation of infection risk at both individual level and population levels using our domain-knowledge-driven infection risk model will significantly enhance the PPE allocation, safety plans for HCP, and hospital staffing strategies.Hospital-acquired infections of communicable viral diseases (CVDs) have been posing a tremendous challenge to healthcare workers globally. Healthcare personnel (HCP) is facing a consistent risk of viral infections, and subsequently higher rates of morbidity and mortality.We proposed a domain-knowledge-driven infection risk model to quantify the individual HCP and the population-level risks. For individual-level risk estimation, a time-variant infection risk model is proposed to capture the transmission dynamics of CVDs. At the population-level, the infection risk is estimated using a Bayesian network model constructed from three feature sets, including individual-level factors, engineering control factors, and administrative control factors. For model validation, we investigated the case study of the Coronavirus disease, in which the individual-level and population-level infection risk models were applied. The data were collected from various sources such as COVID-19 transmission databases, health surveys\/questionaries from medical centers, U.S. Department of Labor databases, and cross-sectional studies.","936":"CMDS had statistically significantly greater predictive and discriminative ability than EOSS for persons aged 40 to 75. While the clinical relevance of these differences is unknown, CMDS may have greater clinical utility given that it uses fewer items to risk stratify. The clinical relevance and utility need to be studied further. and C-statistics. Median years of life lost were also computed for each score. ), and 0.02 (0.01-0.02) (C-statistics). The median years of life lost for EOSS scores 2 and 3 (low to high risk) for a reference person were 1.19 and 6.76 years. Those for CMDS scores 1, 2, 3, and 4 (low to high risk) were 1.53, 2.90, 3.91, and 8.51 years. Consistent results from the in-sample estimates were observed.Differences in discriminative and predictive ability for all-cause mortality of two clinical staging systems, the Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EOSS) and Cardiometabolic Disease Staging (CMDS), were estimated.","937":"The rise of antimicrobial resistance has led to renewed interest in evaluating phage therapy. In murine models highly effective treatment of acute pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa relies on the synergistic antibacterial activity of bacteriophages with neutrophils. Here, we show that depletion of alveolar macrophages (AM) shortens the survival of mice without boosting the P. aeruginosa load in the lungs. Unexpectedly, upon bacteriophage treatment, pulmonary levels of P. aeruginosa were significantly lower in AM-depleted than in immunocompetent mice. To explore potential mechanisms underlying the benefit of AM-depletion in treated mice, we developed a mathematical model. Integration of model simulations suggest that AM reduce bacteriophage density in the lungs. We experimentally confirmed that the in vivo decay of phage is faster in immunocompetent compared to AM-depleted animals. These findings demonstrate the involvement of feedback between bacteriophage, bacteria, and the immune system in shaping the outcomes of phage therapy in clinical settings.","938":"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is associated with recent or current SARS-CoV-2 infection. Information on MIS-C incidence is limited.In the 7 jurisdictions examined, 248 persons with MIS-C were reported (median [interquartile range] age, 8 [4-13] years; 133 [53.6%] male; 96 persons [38.7%] were Hispanic or Latino; 75 persons [30.2%] were Black). The incidence of MIS-C per 1\u202f000\u202f000 person-months was 5.1 (95% CI, 4.5-5.8) persons. Compared with White persons, incidence per 1\u202f000\u202f000 person-months was higher among Black persons (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR], 9.26 [95% CI, 6.15-13.93]), Hispanic or Latino persons (aIRR, 8.92 [95% CI, 6.00-13.26]), and Asian or Pacific Islander (aIRR, 2.94 [95% CI, 1.49-5.82]) persons. MIS-C incidence per 1\u202f000\u202f000 SARS-CoV-2 infections was 316 (95% CI, 278-357) persons and was higher among Black (aIRR, 5.62 [95% CI, 3.68-8.60]), Hispanic or Latino (aIRR, 4.26 [95% CI, 2.85-6.38]), and Asian or Pacific Islander persons (aIRR, 2.88 [95% CI, 1.42-5.83]) compared with White persons. For both analyses, incidence was highest among children aged 5 years or younger (4.9 [95% CI, 3.7-6.6] children per 1\u202f000\u202f000 person-months) and children aged 6 to 10 years (6.3 [95% CI, 4.8-8.3] children per 1\u202f000\u202f000 person-months).This cohort study used enhanced surveillance data to identify persons with MIS-C during April to June 2020, in 7 jurisdictions reporting to both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention national surveillance and to Overcoming COVID-19, a multicenter MIS-C study. Denominators for population-based estimates were derived from census estimates; denominators for incidence per 1\u202f000\u202f000 SARS-CoV-2 infections were estimated by applying published age- and month-specific multipliers accounting for underdetection of reported COVID-19 case counts. Jurisdictions included Connecticut, Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York (excluding New York City), and Pennsylvania. Data analyses were conducted from August to December 2020.In this cohort study, MIS-C was a rare complication associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Estimates for population-based incidence and incidence among persons with infection were higher among Black, Hispanic or Latino, and Asian or Pacific Islander persons. Further study is needed to understand variability by race\/ethnicity and age group.To estimate population-based MIS-C incidence per 1\u202f000\u202f000 person-months and to estimate MIS-C incidence per 1\u202f000\u202f000 SARS-CoV-2 infections in persons younger than 21 years.Race\/ethnicity, sex, and age group (ie, \u22645, 6-10, 11-15, and 16-20 years).Overall and stratum-specific adjusted estimated MIS-C incidence per 1\u202f000\u202f000 person-months and per 1\u202f000\u202f000 SARS-CoV-2 infections.","939":"Distributional forecasts are important for a wide variety of applications, including forecasting epidemics. Often, forecasts are miscalibrated, or unreliable in assigning uncertainty to future events. We present a recalibration method that can be applied to a black-box forecaster given retrospective forecasts and observations, as well as an extension to make this method more effective in recalibrating epidemic forecasts. This method is guaranteed to improve calibration and log score performance when trained and measured in-sample. We also prove that the increase in expected log score of a recalibrated forecaster is equal to the entropy of the PIT distribution. We apply this recalibration method to the 27 influenza forecasters in the FluSight Network and show that recalibration reliably improves forecast accuracy and calibration. This method, available on Github, is effective, robust, and easy to use as a post-processing tool to improve epidemic forecasts.","940":"A centralized RT-PCR testing system contributes to critical delays in processing, which may mask a case burden higher than reported, impeding timely awareness, and adequate clinical care and vaccination strategies and subsequent monitoring. Although Ecuador adapted or authorized existing facilities to address limitations in laboratory capacity for COVID-19, this study highlights the need to estimate and augment laboratory capabilities for improved decision making and policies on diagnostic guidelines and availability. Support is needed to procure the necessary human and physical resources at all phases of diagnostic testing, including transportation of samples and supplies, and information management. Strengthening emergency preparedness enables a clear understanding of COVID-19 disparities within and across the country.The national average time for case completion was 3\u2009days; 12.1% of samples took \u226510\u2009days to complete; the national average daily backlog was 29.1 tests per 100,000 people. Only 8 out of 24 provinces had authorized COVID-19 processing laboratories but not all processed samples. There was an association between samples coming from outside the processing laboratory province, the number of other samples present at the laboratory during processing, and the amount of time needed to process a sample. Samples from another province took 1.29 times as long to process, on average. The percentage of pending results on April 30 was 67.1%.Testing is crucial for COVID-19 response and management, however, WHO's preparedness index omits estimations of actual testing capabilities, which influence the ability to contain, mitigate and clinically manage infectious diseases. With one of the highest excess death rates globally, Ecuador had a comparatively low number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, which may have been influenced by limited availability of data for decision-making due to low laboratory capacity.We examine de-identified data on 55,063 individuals with suspected COVID-19 between February 27 and April 30, 2020 included in the RT-PCR testing database collected by the Ministry of Health. Processing times and rates per province, and the number of pending tests, were tallied cumulatively. We assessed the relationship between sample shipping, laboratory capacity and case completion using a negative binomial generalized linear model.","941":"It is unclear whether polypharmacy is associated with difficulty taking medications amongst people aged\u226585 living at home. This is despite the projected decline in availability of family carers, who may support independent living. Using Newcastle 85+ Study data and mixed-effects modelling, we investigated the association between polypharmacy and difficulty taking medications amongst 85-year-olds living at home, over a 10-year time-period. Polypharmacy was not associated with difficulty taking medications as either a continuous (OR=0.99 [0.91-1.08]) or categorical variable (5-9 medications, OR=0.69 [0.34-1.41]; \u226510 medications, OR=0.85 [0.34-2.07]). The significant predictors included disability, visual and cognitive impairment. Our results suggest that people aged\u226585 living at home with disability, visual and\/or cognitive impairment will have difficulty taking their medications, regardless of how many they are prescribed. Therefore, healthcare professionals should routinely ask about, assess and address problems that these patient groups may have with taking their medicines, independent of the number of drugs taken.","942":"Temperate phage can initiate lysis or lysogeny after infecting a bacterial host. The genetic switch between lysis and lysogeny is mediated by phage regulatory genes as well as host and environmental factors. Recently, a new class of decision switches was identified in phage of the SPbeta group, mediated by the extracellular release of small, phage-encoded peptides termed arbitrium. Arbitrium peptides can be taken up by bacteria prior to infection, modulating the decision switch in the event of a subsequent phage infection. Increasing the concentration of arbitrium increases the chance that a phage infection will lead to lysogeny, rather than lysis. Although prior work has centered on the molecular mechanisms of arbitrium-induced switching, here we focus on how selective pressures impact the benefits of plasticity in switching responses. In this work, we examine the possible advantages of near-term adaptation of communication-based decision switches used by the SPbeta-like group. We combine a nonlinear population model with a control-theoretic approach to evaluate the relationship between a putative phage reaction norm (i.e. the probability of lysogeny as a function of arbitrium) and the extent of phage reproduction at a near-term time horizon. We measure phage reproduction in terms of a cellular-level metric previously shown to enable comparisons of near-term phage fitness across a continuum from lysis to latency. We show the adaptive potential of communication-based lysis-lysogeny responses and find that optimal switching between lysis and lysogeny increases the near-term phage reproduction compared to fixed responses, further supporting both molecular- and model-based analyses of the putative benefits of this class of decision switches. We further find that plastic responses are robust to the inclusion of cellular-level stochasticity, variation in life history traits, and variation in resource availability. These findings provide further support to explore the long-term evolution of plastic decision systems mediated by extracellular decision-signaling molecules and the feedback between phage reaction norms and ecological context.","943":"Improvements in water and sanitation should reduce cholera risk though the associations between cholera and specific water and sanitation access measures remain unclear. We estimated the association between eight water and sanitation measures and annual cholera incidence access across sub-Saharan Africa (2010-2016) for data aggregated at the country and district levels. We fit random forest regression and classification models to understand how well these measures combined might be able to predict cholera incidence rates and identify high cholera incidence areas. Across spatial scales, piped or \"other improved\" water access was inversely associated with cholera incidence. Access to piped water, septic or sewer sanitation, and septic, sewer, or \"other improved\" sanitation were associated with decreased district-level cholera incidence. The classification model had moderate performance in identifying high cholera incidence areas (cross-validated-AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.78-0.83) with high negative predictive values (93-100%) indicating the utility of water and sanitation measures for screening out areas that are unlikely to be at high cholera risk. While comprehensive cholera risk assessments must incorporate other data sources (e.g., historical incidence), our results suggest that water and sanitation measures could alone be useful in narrowing the geographic focus for detailed risk assessments.","944":"We constructed a compartmental metapopulation model parameterized to describe observed patterns of syphilis transmission. We estimated the impact of different approaches to screening, including perfect adherence to current U.S. screening guidelines in MSM.The current syphilis epidemic in the United States is concentrated in gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), but substantial heterosexual transmission is reported in some parts of the country. Using the U.S. states of Louisiana and Massachusetts as case studies, we investigated how epidemic context influences the impact of population screening approaches for syphilis control.In Louisiana, where syphilis cases are more evenly distributed among MSM and heterosexual populations, we projected that screening according to guidelines would contribute to no change or an increase in syphilis burden, compared to burden with current estimated screening coverage. In Massachusetts, which has a more MSM-focused outbreak, we projected that screening according to guidelines would be as or more effective than current screening coverage in most population groups.MSM-focused approaches to screening may be insufficient for control when there is substantial transmission in heterosexual populations. Epidemic characteristics may be useful when identifying at-risk groups for syphilis screening.","945":"Nowadays, the ability to make data-driven decisions in public health is of utmost importance. To achieve this, it is necessary for modelers to comprehend the impact of models on the future state of healthcare systems. Compartmental models are a valuable tool for making informed epidemiological decisions, and the proper parameterization of these models is crucial for analyzing epidemiological events. This work evaluated the use of compartmental models in conjunction with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to determine optimal solutions and understand the dynamics of Dengue epidemics. The focus was on calculating and evaluating the rate of case reproduction, R0 , for the Republic of Panama. Three compartmental models were compared: Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR), Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR), and Susceptible-Infected-Recovered Human-Susceptible-Infected Vector (SIR Human-SI Vector, SIR-SI). The models were informed by demographic data and Dengue incidence in the Republic of Panama between 1999 and 2022, and the susceptible population was analyzed. The SIR, SEIR, and SIR-SI models successfully provided R0 estimates ranging from 1.09 to 1.74. This study provides, to the best of our understanding, the first calculation of R0 for Dengue outbreaks in the Republic of Panama.","946":"Older people had suboptimal vaccine uptake compared to children in both contexts and need more attention to enhance influenza vaccination. Tailoring interventions to different vaccine funding contexts may help improve influenza vaccination: In self-paid context, motivating people to accept their first ever influenza vaccination may be a promising strategy. In subsidized context, improving public confidence in vaccine effectiveness and providers' advice would be useful.Influenza vaccination is the key to prevent influenza-related disease, especially among high-risk populations. However, influenza vaccine uptake in China is low. This secondary analysis of a quasi-experimental trial aimed to understand factors associated with influenza vaccine uptake among children and older people stratified by funding context.A total of 225 children (aged 0.5-8 years) and 225 older people (aged 60 years or above) were recruited from three clinics (rural, suburban and urban) in Guangdong Province. Participants were allocated into two groups based on funding contexts: a self-paid group (N\u2009=\u2009150, 75 children and 75 older adults) in which participants paid full price for their vaccination; and a subsidized group (N\u2009=\u2009300, 150 children and 150 older adults) in which varying levels of financial support was provided. Univariate and multivariable logistic regressions were conducted stratified by funding contexts.Overall, 75.0% (225\/300) of participants in the subsidized group and 36.7% (55\/150) in the self-paid group got vaccinated. Older adults had lower vaccination rates than children in both funding groups, while both age groups showed much higher uptake in the subsidized group than in the self-paid group (aOR\u2009=\u20095.96, 95% CI: 3.77-9.42, p\u2009=\u20090.001). In the self-paid group, having prior influenza vaccination history of children (aOR:2.61, 95%CI: 1.06-6.42) or older people (aOR:4.76, 95%CI: 1.08-20.90) was associated with increased influenza vaccine uptake compared to those who had no prior vaccination experiences in the family. While in the subsidized group, participants who got married or lived with partners (aOR\u2009=\u20090.32, 0.10-0.98) had lower vaccination uptake than single ones. Trust in providers' advice (aOR\u2009=\u20094.95, 95%CI:1.99, 12.43), perceived effectiveness of the vaccine (aOR: 12.18, 95%CI: 5.21-28.50), and experienced influenza-like illnesses in the family in the past year (aOR\u2009=\u200946.52, 4.10, 533.78) were associated with higher vaccine uptake.","947":"Data were obtained on attendees at Phase 3 Events Research Programme events, for which some infection risk mitigation measures were in place (i.e. evidence of vaccination or a negative lateral flow test). Attendance data were linked with COVID-19 test result data from the UK Test and Trace system. Using a self-controlled case series design, we measured the within person incidence rate ratio for testing positive for COVID-19, comparing the rate in days 3 to 9 following event attendance (high risk period) with days 1 and 2 and 10-16 (baseline period). Rate ratios were adjusted for estimates of underlying regional COVID-19 prevalence to account for population level fluctuations in infection risk, and events were grouped into broadly similar types.For the majority of event types studied in the third phase of the UK Events Research Programme, we found no evidence of an increased risk of COVID-19 transmission associated with event attendance. However, we found a 70% increased risk of infection associated with attendance at mainly outdoor unseated multi-day events. We have also demonstrated a novel use for self-controlled case series methodology in monitoring infection risk associated with event attendance.In 2021, whilst societies were emerging from major social restrictions during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the UK government instigated an Events Research Programme to examine the risk of COVID-19 transmission from attendance at cultural events and explore ways to enable people to attend a range of events whilst minimising risk of transmission. We aimed to measure any impact on risk of COVID-19 transmission from attendance at events held at or close to commercially viable capacity using routinely collected data.From attendance data available for 188,851 attendees, 3357 people tested positive for COVID-19 during the observation period. After accounting for total testing trends over the period, incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals for positive tests were 1.16 (0.53-2.57) for indoor seated events, 1.12 (0.95-1.30) for mainly outdoor seated events, 0.65 (0.51-0.83) for mainly outdoor partially seated events, and 1.70 (1.52-1.89) for mainly outdoor unseated multi-day events.","948":"Urban wastewater reuse for agriculture provides reliable nutrient-rich water, reduces water stress, and strengthens food systems. However, wastewater reuse also presents health risks and characterizing the spatial dynamics of wastewater can help optimize risk mitigation. We conducted comparative risk analysis of exposure to wastewater in irrigation canals, where we compared those exposed to a) treated vs. untreated wastewater, and b) wastewater upstream vs. downstream from communities in the Mezquital Valley. The canal system with treated wastewater was sampled prior to being treated, directly after treatment, as well as before and after it flowed through a community. Along the canal system that carried untreated wastewater, we sampled before and after a community. We quantified the concentrations of bacterial, protozoal, and viral pathogens in the wastewater. Pathogen concentration data were used to calculate measures of relative risk between sampling points. Wastewater treatment reduced predicted bacterial pathogen infection risk in post-treatment locations (RR\u202f=\u202f0.73, 95\u202f% CI 0.61, 0.87), with no evidence of similar reductions in Giardia or viral pathogens (RR\u202f=\u202f1.02, 95\u202f% CI 0.56, 1.86 and RR\u202f=\u202f1.18, 95\u202f% CI 0.70, 2.02 respectively). Although infection risk decreased further down the canals, infection risk increased for bacterial pathogens after our sentinel community (RR\u202f=\u202f1.94, 95\u202f% 1.34, 2.86). For Giardia and viral pathogens infection risk was elevated but not significantly. We found similar evidence for increases in risk when comparing the treated section of the canal system with a canal section whose wastewater was not treated, i.e., the risk benefits of wastewater treatment were lost after our sentinel community for bacteria (RR\u202f=\u202f5.27 vs. 2.08 for sampling points before and after our sentinel community respectively) and for Giardia (RR\u202f=\u202f6.98 vs. 3.35 respectively). The increase in risk after transit through communities could have resulted from local community recontamination of the treated wastewater stream.","949":"The diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder in the DSM-5-TR features the option to designate levels of support for social communication (SC) and restricted, repetitive behaviors (RRB). These levels are conceptual in nature, but research indicates standardized assessment outcomes correspond with clinician-assigned levels of support. The purpose of the present study was to identify factors that influence designated levels of support for SC and RRBs when diagnosing autism. Standardized assessment scores across intellectual functioning, adaptive skills, and ASD symptomology were analyzed to determine corresponding levels of support in SC and RRBs assigned by clinicians for 136 autistic children following a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation. At diagnosis, approximately 46% of participants were described as needing substantial support (Level 2) for SC and 49% were described as needing substantial support (Level 2) for RRB. There was a consistent pattern of higher to lower intellectual and adaptive functioning needing Level 1-Level 3 support. Autism assessment results followed a gradient of fewer to greater autism symptoms from Level 1 to Level 3 support. Findings indicated clinician-assigned levels of support for SC and RRB were associated with intellectual functioning, adaptive functioning, autism symptomology, and age, but not sex.","950":"The majority of mosquito-borne illness is spread by a few mosquito species that have evolved to specialize in biting humans, yet the precise causes of this behavioral shift are poorly understood. We address this gap in the arboviral vector Aedes aegypti. We first collect and characterize the behavior of mosquitoes from 27 sites scattered across the species' ancestral range in sub-Saharan Africa, revealing previously unrecognized variation in preference for human versus animal odor. We then use modeling to show that over 80% of this variation can be predicted by two ecological factors-dry season intensity and human population density. Finally, we integrate this information with whole-genome sequence data from 375 individual mosquitoes to identify a single underlying ancestry component linked to human preference. Genetic changes associated with human specialist ancestry were concentrated in a few chromosomal regions. Our findings suggest that human-biting in this important disease vector originally evolved as a by-product of breeding in human-stored water in areas where doing so provided the only means to survive the long, hot dry season. Our model also predicts that the rapid urbanization currently taking place in Africa will drive further mosquito evolution, causing a shift toward human-biting in many large cities by 2050.","951":"Hospital admission and discharge dynamics facilitate pathogen transmission among individuals in communities, hospitals, nursing homes, and other healthcare facilities. We developed a microsimulation to simulate this movement, as patients are at increased risk for healthcare-associated infections, antibiotic exposure, and other health complications while admitted to healthcare facilities. Patients can also serve as a source of infection throughout the healthcare network as they move locations. This microsimulation is a base model that can be enhanced with various disease-specific agent-based health modules. We calibrated the model to simulate patient movement in North Carolina, where over 1 million hospital admissions occur annually. Each patient originated from a unique starting location and eventually transferred to another healthcare facility or returned home. Here, we describe our calibration efforts to ensure an accurate patient flow and discuss the necessary steps to replicate this model for other healthcare networks.","952":"The odds of living a long and healthy life with HIV infection have dramatically improved with the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy. Along with the early development and clinical trials of these drugs, and new field of research emerged called viral dynamics, which uses mathematical models to interpret and predict the time-course of viral levels during infection and how they are altered by treatment. In this review, we summarize the contributions that virus dynamics models have made to understanding the pathophysiology of infection and to designing effective therapies. This includes studies of the multiphasic decay of viral load when antiretroviral therapy is given, the evolution of drug resistance, the long-term persistence latently infected cells, and the rebound of viremia when drugs are stopped. We additionally discuss new work applying viral dynamics models to new classes of investigational treatment for HIV, including latency-reversing agents and immunotherapy.","953":" Our finding of a highly-overdispersed offspring distribution highlights a potential benefit to focusing intervention efforts on superspreading. As most infected individuals do not contribute to the expansion of an epidemic, the effective reproduction number could be drastically reduced by preventing relatively rare superspreading events.","954":"Documenting the natural diversity of eukaryotic organisms in the nonhuman primate (NHP) gut is important for understanding the evolution of the mammalian gut microbiome, its role in digestion, health and disease, and the consequences of anthropogenic change on primate biology and conservation. Despite the ecological significance of gut-associated eukaryotes, little is known about the factors that influence their assembly and diversity in mammals. In this study, we used an 18S rRNA gene fragment metabarcoding approach to assess the eukaryotic assemblage of 62 individuals representing 16 NHP species. We find that cercopithecoids, and especially the cercopithecines, have substantially higher alpha diversity than other NHP groups. Gut-associated protists and nematodes are widespread among NHPs, consistent with their ancient association with NHP hosts. However, we do not find a consistent signal of phylosymbiosis or host-species specificity. Rather, gut eukaryotes are only weakly structured by primate phylogeny with\u00a0minimal signal from diet, in contrast to previous reports of NHP gut bacteria. The results of this study indicate that gut-associated eukaryotes offer different information than gut-associated bacteria and add to our understanding of the structure of the gut microbiome.","955":"HIV has been shown to increase the likelihood of oral HPV infection. In this study, we evaluated the risk of oral HPV in HIV infected patients compared with HIV-negative controls.Oral HPV was detected in 23% of HIV\u00a0+\u00a0vs. 10% of HIV- participants (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Men had a higher oral HPV prevalence than women (27% vs. 15% HIV+, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03, 16% vs. 5% HIV-, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Risk factors among HIV\u00a0+\u00a0participants included more lifetime deep kissing and oral sex partners, and history of AIDS. Persistent oral HPV was detected in 23% of HIV\u00a0+\u00a0vs. 5% of HIV- participants (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Among 8 HIV\u00a0+\u00a0participants with CD4 counts <200\u00a0cell\/\u03bcL none had cleared their HPV infection during the study.101 healthy adult volunteers (HIV-) and 245 adults living with HIV infection (HIV+) were recruited from 5 academic medical centers. Questionnaires and saliva samples were obtained every 3-8 months over a period of 2 years (2015-2017). DNA was isolated from the saliva samples and tested for 18 high- and low-risk genotypes.Risk of oral HPV infection and persistence was significantly higher in HIV\u00a0+\u00a0adults with a history of poorly controlled HIV, which may put them at increased risk of HPV-associated cancer.","956":"Background Disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes persist across the United States. Social determinants of health play an important role in driving these disparities. The current study aims to identify the most important social determinants associated with CVD mortality over time in US counties. Methods and Results The authors used the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's database on social determinants of health and linked it with CVD mortality data at the county level from 2009 to 2018. The age-standardized CVD mortality rate was measured as the number of deaths per 100\u2009000 people. Penalized generalized estimating equations were used to select social determinants associated with county-level CVD mortality. The analytic sample included 3142 counties. The penalized generalized estimating equation identified 17 key social determinants of health including rural-urban status, county's racial composition, income, food, and housing status. Over the 10-year period, CVD mortality declined at an annual rate of 1.08 (95% CI, 0.74-1.42) deaths per 100\u2009000 people. Rural counties and counties with a higher percentage of Black residents had a consistently higher CVD mortality rate than urban counties and counties with a lower percentage of Black residents. The rural-urban CVD mortality gap did not change significantly over the past decade, whereas the association between the percentage of Black residents and CVD mortality showed a significant diminishing trend over time. Conclusions County-level CVD mortality declined from 2009 through 2018. However, rural counties and counties with a higher percentage of Black residents continued to experience higher CVD mortality. Median income, food, and housing status consistently predicted higher CVD mortality.","957":"King County residents diagnosed with HIV, 2010-2018.We linked HIV-1 pol gene sequences to demographic information obtained from the National HIV Surveillance System, Public Health - Seattle and King County case investigation and partner services interviews. We determined the likely location of HIV acquisition based on HIV testing, travel histories and cluster-based molecular analyses.Among 2409 people diagnosed with HIV, 798 (33%) were born outside of the United States. We inferred the location of acquisition for 77% of people born outside of the United States: 26% likely acquired HIV locally in King County (of whom 69% were MSM, 16% heterosexual), and 51% likely acquired HIV outside of King County (primarily outside of the United States). Of this 77% of people for whom we inferred the location of HIV acquisition, 45% were determined using traditional epidemiology methods and an additional 32% were inferred using molecular epidemiology methods.We evaluated the ability for molecular epidemiology to augment traditional HIV surveillance beyond the detection of clusters for outbreak investigation. To do this, we address a question of interest to Public Health - Seattle and King County: what proportion of HIV diagnoses among people born outside of the United States are acquired locally?We found that the National HIV Surveillance System misclassified most HIV-infected foreign-born residents as 'new' local infections, and that these cases contribute to an overestimate of local incidence. Our findings highlight how molecular epidemiology can augment traditional HIV surveillance activities and provide useful information to local health jurisdictions beyond molecular cluster detection.","958":"Practices with at least 50 patients 11-17years old with estimated vaccination rates less than national goals, were assigned to intervention (n=11) and control (n=11) groups in a randomized controlled cluster trial; 9 intervention and 11 control sites completed the study. The baseline and active study periods were 7\/1\/2013-6\/30\/2014 and 7\/1\/2014-3\/31\/2015, respectively. Vaccination and demographic data for patients who had a visit in both study periods were derived from de-identified EMR extractions. Primary outcomes were vaccination rates and percentage point (PP) changes. Data were analyzed in 2015-16.Among the cohort of 10,861 adolescent patients, 38% were 11-13years old; 50% were female; 18% were non-white; and 64% were commercially insured. Average baseline HPV initiation rates were 52.5% for intervention and 61.8% for control groups. After 9months, the intervention sites increased HPV initiation 10.2PP compared with 7.3PP in control sites (P10 strategies to improve rates significantly increased the likelihood of HPV series initiation (OR=2.06, 95% CI=1.43, 2.96).Uptake of meningococcal vaccine (MCV) and tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine among adolescents has approached Healthy People 2020 goals, but human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has not. This study evaluated an intervention using the 4 Pillars\u2122 Practice Transformation Program to increase HPV, MCV and Tdap uptake among adolescents in primary care practices.Using >10 strategies from the 4 Pillars\u2122 Practice Transformation Program is effective for increasing HPV series initiation among adolescents. Clinical trial registry number: NCT02165722.","959":"We developed a Markov cost-effectiveness model simulating patients with small (<7 mm) UIAs managed by active surveillance via MRA, immediate surgery, or watchful waiting. Inputs for the model were abstracted from the literature and used to construct a comprehensive model following persons from diagnosis to death. Outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), lifetime medical costs (2015 USD), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Cost-effectiveness, deterministic, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.Current guidelines recommend active surveillance with serial magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) for management of small, asymptomatic unruptured anterior circulation aneurysms (UIAs). We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of active surveillance compared to immediate surgery.Immediate surgical treatment is a cost-effective strategy for initial management of small UIAs in patients <70 years of age. While more costly than MRA, surgical treatment increased QALY. The cost-effectiveness of immediate surgery is highly sensitive to diagnosis age, rupture rate, and surgical complication risk. Though there are a wide range of rupture rates and complications associated with treatment, this analysis supports the treatment of small, unruptured anterior circulation intracranial aneurysms in patients <70 years of age.Immediate surgical treatment was the most cost-effective management strategy for small UIAs with ICER of USD 45,772 relative to active surveillance. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated immediate surgery was the preferred strategy, if rupture rate was >0.1%\/year and if the diagnosis age was 11%. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that at a willingness-to-pay of USD 100,000\/QALY, immediate surgical treatment was the most cost-effective strategy in 64% of iterations.","960":"High throughput sequencing enables rapid genome sequencing during infectious disease outbreaks and provides an opportunity to quantify the evolutionary dynamics of pathogens in near real-time. One difficulty of undertaking evolutionary analyses over short timescales is the dependency of the inferred evolutionary parameters on the timespan of observation. Crucially, there is an increasing number of molecular clock analyses using external evolutionary rate priors to infer evolutionary parameters. However, it is not clear which rate prior is appropriate for a given time window of observation due to the time-dependent nature of evolutionary rate estimates. Here, we characterise the molecular evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza during the first 12\u2009months of their respective pandemics. We use Bayesian phylogenetic methods to estimate the dates of emergence, evolutionary rates, and growth rates of SARS-CoV-2 and pH1N1 over time and investigate how varying sampling window and dataset sizes affects the accuracy of parameter estimation. We further use a generalised McDonald-Kreitman test to estimate the number of segregating non-neutral sites over time. We find that the inferred evolutionary parameters for both pandemics are time-dependent, and that the inferred rates of SARS-CoV-2 and pH1N1 decline by \u223c50% and \u223c100%, respectively, over the course of one year. After at least 4\u2009months since the start of sequence sampling, inferred growth rates and emergence dates remain relatively stable and can be inferred reliably using a logistic growth coalescent model. We show that the time-dependency of the mean substitution rate is due to elevated substitution rates at terminal branches which are 2-4 times higher than those of internal branches for both viruses. The elevated rate at terminal branches is strongly correlated with an increasing number of segregating non-neutral sites, demonstrating the role of purifying selection in generating the time-dependency of evolutionary parameters during pandemics.","961":"Search terms for Human-Computer Interaction, Biomedical Informatics, and Ethics were used to identify relevant papers published between 2017 and 2019.Relevant papers were identified through multiple methods, including database searches, manual reviews of citations, recent publications, and special collections, as well as through peer recommendations. Identified articles were reviewed and organized into broad themes.To provide an overview of recent work at the intersection of Biomedical Informatics, Human-Computer Interaction, and Ethics.The results of this overview demonstrate an active interest in exploring the ethical implications of Human-Computer Interaction concerns in Biomedical Informatics. Papers emphasizing ethical concerns associated with patient-facing tools, mobile devices, social media, privacy, inclusivity, and e-consent reflect the growing prominence of these topics in biomedical informatics research. New questions in these areas will likely continue to arise with the growth of precision medicine and citizen science.We identified relevant papers at the intersection of Biomedical Informatics, Human-Computer Interactions, and Ethics in over a dozen journals. The content of these papers was organized into three broad themes: ethical issues associated with systems in use, systems design, and responsible conduct of research.","962":"Body size influences many traits including those that affect host competence, the propensity to cause new infections. Here, we employ a new framework to reveal that, for at least two infections, West Nile virus and Lyme disease, large hosts should be more competent than small ones, but their lower abundance could mitigate their impacts on local risk. By contrast, for rabies, small hosts will be disproportionately more competent than large ones, an effect amplified by the higher densities of small species. These outcomes differ quite a bit from previous approaches that incorporate allometries into epidemiological models. Subsequently, we advocate for future integrative work to resolve how interspecific variation in body size influences the emergence and spread of infections.","963":"Mathematical modeling of infectious diseases is an important decision-making tool for outbreak control. However, in Africa, limited expertise reduces the use and impact of these tools on policy. Therefore, there is a need to build capacity in Africa for the use of mathematical modeling to inform policy. Here we describe our experience implementing a mathematical modeling training program for public health professionals in East Africa.Mathematical modeling training programs for public health professionals in Africa can be an effective tool for research capacity building and policy support to mitigate infectious disease burden and forecast resources. Overall, the course was successful, owing to a combination of factors, including institutional support, trainees' commitment, intensive mentorship, a diverse trainee pool, and regular evaluations.Out of 875 applications from 38 countries, we selected ten trainees from three countries - Rwanda (6), Kenya (2), and Uganda (2) - with guidance from an advisory committee. Nine trainees were based at government institutions and one at an academic organization. Participants gained skills in developing models to answer questions of interest and critically appraising modeling studies. At the end of the training, trainees prepared policy briefs summarizing their modeling study findings. These were presented at a dissemination event to policymakers, researchers, and program managers. All trainees indicated they would recommend the course to colleagues and rated the quality of the training with a median score of 9\/10.We used a deliverable-driven and learning-by-doing model to introduce trainees to the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases. The training comprised two two-week in-person sessions and a practicum where trainees received intensive mentorship. Trainees evaluated the content and structure of the course at the end of each week, and this feedback informed the strategy for subsequent weeks.","964":"Developing models for individualized, time-varying treatment optimization from observational data with large variable spaces, e.g., electronic health records (EHR), is problematic because of inherent, complex bias that can change over time. Traditional methods such as the g-formula are robust, but must identify critical subsets of variables due to combinatorial issues. Machine learning approaches such as causal survival forests have fewer constraints and can provide fine-tuned, individualized counterfactual predictions. In this study, we aimed to optimize time-varying antibiotic treatment -identifying treatment heterogeneity and conditional treatment effects- against invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) infections, using statewide EHR data collected in Florida, USA. While many previous studies focused on measuring the effects of the first empiric treatment (i.e., usually vancomycin), our study focuses on dynamic sequential treatment changes, comparing possible vancomycin switches with other antibiotics at clinically relevant time points, e.g., after obtaining a bacterial culture and susceptibility testing. Our study population included adult individuals admitted to the hospital with invasive MRSA. We collected demographic, clinical, medication, and laboratory information from the EHR for these patients. Then, we followed three sequential antibiotic choices (i.e., their empiric treatment, subsequent directed treatment, and final sustaining treatment), evaluating 30-day mortality as the outcome. We applied both causal survival forests and g-formula using different clinical intervention policies. We found that switching from vancomycin to another antibiotic improved survival probability, yet there was a benefit from initiating vancomycin compared to not using it at any time point. These findings show consistency with the empiric choice of vancomycin before confirmation of MRSA and shed light on how to manage switches on course. In conclusion, this application of causal machine learning on EHR demonstrates utility in modeling dynamic, heterogeneous treatment effects that cannot be evaluated precisely using randomized clinical trials.","965":"Global airline networks play a key role in the global importation of emerging infectious diseases. Detailed information on air traffic between international airports has been demonstrated to be useful in retrospectively validating and prospectively predicting case emergence in other countries. In this paper, we use a well-established metric known as effective distance on the global air traffic data from IATA to quantify risk of emergence for different countries as a consequence of direct importation from China, and compare it against arrival times for the first 24 countries. Using this model trained on official first reports from WHO, we estimate time of arrival (ToA) for all other countries. We then incorporate data on airline suspensions to recompute the effective distance and assess the effect of such cancellations in delaying the estimated arrival time for all other countries. Finally we use the infectious disease vulnerability indices to explain some of the estimated reporting delays.","966":"The administrative process associated with clinical trial activation has been criticized as costly, complex, and time-consuming. Prior research has concentrated on identifying administrative barriers and proposing various solutions to reduce activation time, and consequently associated costs. Here, we expand on previous research by incorporating social network analysis and discrete-event simulation to support process improvement decision-making.The presented process improvement analytic framework not only identifies administrative barriers, but also helps to devise and evaluate potential improvement scenarios. The strength of our framework lies in its system analysis approach that recognizes the stochastic duration of the activation process and the interdependence between process activities and entities.The administrative process comprised 5 sub-processes, 30 activities, 11 decision points, 5 loops, and 8 participants. The mean activation time was 76.6 days. Rate-limiting sub-processes were those of contract and budget development. Key participants during contract and budget development were the Office of Clinical Research, sponsors, and the principal investigator. Simulation results indicate that slight increments on the number of trials, arriving to the Office of Clinical Research, would increase activation time by 11 %. Also, incrementing the efficiency of contract and budget development would reduce the activation time by 28 %. Finally, better synchronization between contract and budget development would reduce time spent on batching documentation; however, no improvements would be attained in total activation time.We searched for all operational data associated with the administrative process of activating industry-sponsored clinical trials at the Office of Clinical Research of the University of South Florida in Tampa, Florida. We limited the search to those trials initiated and activated between July 2011 and June 2012. We described the process using value stream mapping, studied the interactions of the various process participants using social network analysis, and modeled potential process modifications using discrete-event simulation.","967":"Nine modeling teams contributed state- and national-level projections for weekly counts of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States for the period September 12, 2021 to March 12, 2022. Four scenarios covered all combinations of: 1) presence vs. absence of vaccination of children ages 5-11 years starting on November 1, 2021; and 2) continued dominance of the Delta variant vs. emergence of a hypothetical more transmissible variant on November 15, 2021. Individual team projections were combined using linear pooling. The effect of childhood vaccination on overall and age-specific outcomes was estimated by meta-analysis approaches.SARS-CoV-2 vaccination of persons aged 12 years and older has reduced disease burden in the United States. The COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub convened multiple modeling teams in September 2021 to project the impact of expanding vaccine administration to children 5-11 years old on anticipated COVID-19 burden and resilience against variant strains.Absent a new variant, COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths among all ages were projected to decrease nationally through mid-March 2022. Under a set of specific assumptions, models projected that vaccination of children 5-11 years old was associated with reductions in all-age cumulative cases (7.2%, mean incidence ratio [IR] 0.928, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.880-0.977), hospitalizations (8.7%, mean IR 0.913, 95% CI 0.834-0.992), and deaths (9.2%, mean IR 0.908, 95% CI 0.797-1.020) compared with scenarios where children were not vaccinated. This projected effect of vaccinating children 5-11 years old increased in the presence of a more transmissible variant, assuming no change in vaccine effectiveness by variant. Larger relative reductions in cumulative cases, hospitalizations, and deaths were observed for children than for the entire U.S. population. Substantial state-level variation was projected in epidemic trajectories, vaccine benefits, and variant impacts.Results from this multi-model aggregation study suggest that, under a specific set of scenario assumptions, expanding vaccination to children 5-11 years old would provide measurable direct benefits to this age group and indirect benefits to the all-age U.S. population, including resilience to more transmissible variants.","968":"Most studies on seasonal influenza A\/H3N2 virus adaptation have focused on the main antigenic gene, hemagglutinin. However, there is increasing evidence that the genome-wide genetic background of novel antigenic variants can influence these variants' emergence probabilities and impact their patterns of dominance in the population. This suggests that non-antigenic genes may be important in shaping the viral evolutionary dynamics. To better understand the role of selection on non-antigenic genes in the adaptive evolution of seasonal influenza viruses, we have developed a simple population genetic model that considers a virus with one antigenic and one non-antigenic gene segment. By simulating this model under different regimes of selection and reassortment, we find that the empirical patterns of lineage turnover for the antigenic and non-antigenic gene segments are best captured when there is both limited viral coinfection and selection operating on both gene segments. In contrast, under a scenario of only neutral evolution in the non-antigenic gene segment, we see persistence of multiple lineages for long periods of time in that segment, which is not compatible with observed molecular evolutionary patterns. Further, we find that reassortment, occurring in coinfected individuals, can increase the speed of viral adaptive evolution by primarily reducing selective interference and genetic linkage effects. Together, these findings suggest that, for influenza, with six internal or non-antigenic gene segments, the evolutionary dynamics of novel antigenic variants are likely to be influenced by the genome-wide genetic background as a result of linked selection among both beneficial and deleterious mutations.","969":" sp. strain NB0720_010, isolated from Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. NB0702_10 has several large (>3,000-amino acid) protein-coding genes that may be important in its interactions with other cells, including grazers in estuarine habitats.","970":"We present a framework for the projection of ZIKV autochthonous transmission in the contiguous US during the 2015-2016 epidemic using a data-driven stochastic and spatial epidemic model accounting for seasonal, environmental, and detailed population data. The model generates an ensemble of travel-related case counts and simulates their potential to have triggered local transmission at the individual level in the 2015-2016 ZIKV epidemic.This framework provides quantitative risk estimates, fully captures the stochasticity of ZIKV introduction events, and is not biased by the under-ascertainment of cases due to asymptomatic cases. It provides general information on key risk determinants and data with potential uses in defining public health recommendations and guidance about ZIKV risk in the US.We estimate the risk of ZIKV introduction and local transmission at the county level and at the 0.025\u00b0\u2009\u00d7\u20090.025\u00b0 cell level across the contiguous US. We provide a risk measure based on the probability of observing local transmission in a specific location during a ZIKV epidemic modeled after the epidemic observed during the years 2015-2016. The high spatial and temporal resolution of the model allows us to generate statistical estimates of the number of ZIKV introductions leading to local transmission in each location. We find that the risk was spatially heterogeneously distributed and concentrated in a few specific areas that account for less than 1% of the contiguous US population. Locations in Texas and Florida that have actually experienced local ZIKV transmission were among the places at highest risk according to our results. We also provide an analysis of the key determinants for local transmission and identify the key introduction routes and their contributions to ZIKV transmission in the contiguous US.Local mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission has been reported in two counties in the contiguous United States (US), prompting the issuance of travel, prevention, and testing guidance across the contiguous US. Large uncertainty, however, surrounds the quantification of the actual risk of ZIKV introduction and autochthonous transmission across different areas of the US.","971":"We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of available data on vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody seropositivity to non-vaccine incorporated HPV genotypes.These data improve our understanding of vaccine-induced functional antibody specificity against non-vaccine incorporated genotypes and may help to parameterize vaccine-impact models and improve patient management in a post-vaccine setting.Of 304 articles screened, 9 were included in the analysis representing ca. 700 individuals. The pooled estimate for seropositivity against HPV31 for the bivalent vaccine (86%; 95%CI 78-91%) was higher than that for the quadrivalent vaccine (61%; 39-79%; p=0.011). The pooled estimate for seropositivity against HPV45 for the bivalent vaccine (50%; 37-64%) was also higher than that for the quadrivalent vaccine (16%; 6-36%; p=0.007). Seropositivity against HPV33, HPV52 and HPV58 were similar between the vaccines. Mean seropositivity rates across non-vaccine genotypes were positively associated with the corresponding vaccine efficacy data reported from vaccine trials.Human papillomavirus vaccines have demonstrated remarkable efficacy against persistent infection and disease associated with vaccine-incorporated genotypes and a degree of efficacy against some genetically related, non-vaccine-incorporated genotypes. The vaccines differ in the extent of cross-protection against these non-vaccine genotypes. Data supporting the role for neutralizing antibodies as a correlate or surrogate of cross-protection are lacking, as is a robust assessment of the seroconversion rates against these non-vaccine genotypes.","972":"Tuberculosis (TB) cases and deaths in the United States fluctuated substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed multiple data sources to understand the factors contributing to these changes and estimated future TB trends.We identified four mechanisms potentially contributing to observed TB trends during 2020-2023: immigration, respiratory contact rates, rates of accurate diagnosis and treatment initiation, and mortality rates for persons with TB disease. We employed a Bayesian approach to synthesize evidence on how these mechanisms changed during the pandemic and how they might have combined to produce observed 2020-2023 TB data, using a transmission-dynamic model to link mechanisms to TB outcomes. We also simulated a no-pandemic counterfactual scenario that assumed mechanisms followed pre-pandemic trends. We estimated TB outcomes associated with the pandemic until 2035 to capture lagged effects. We evaluated additional scenarios to estimate the individual effect of each mechanism.Over the 2020-2035 study period, we estimate an additional 2,784 (95% uncertainty interval: 2,164-3,461) TB cases and 1,138 (1,076-1,201) TB deaths in the United States associated with changes occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic. The four mechanisms had offsetting effects - decreases in TB diagnosis rates and increases in TB mortality rates led to more TB deaths, while reductions in contact rates reduced TB deaths. Immigration changes initially reduced TB deaths, but increased deaths over time.While the direct impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic occurred between 2020-2023, these changes may continue to influence TB incidence and mortality in future years.","973":"The findings from this study will provide robust epidemiological evidence of the efficacy of TIRS in reducing ABV illness and infection. If efficacious, TIRS could drive a paradigm shift in Aedes control by considering Ae. aegypti behavior to guide residual insecticide applications and changing deployment to preemptive control (rather than in response to symptomatic cases), two major enhancements to existing practice.National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH\/NIAID).Current urban vector control strategies have failed to contain dengue epidemics and to prevent the global expansion of Aedes-borne viruses (ABVs: dengue, chikungunya, Zika). Part of the challenge in sustaining effective ABV control emerges from the paucity of evidence regarding the epidemiological impact of any Aedes control method. A strategy for which there is limited epidemiological evidence is targeted indoor residual spraying (TIRS). TIRS is a modification of classic malaria indoor residual spraying that accounts for Aedes aegypti resting behavior by applying residual insecticides on exposed lower sections of walls (<\u20091.5\u2009m), under furniture, and on dark surfaces.We are pursuing a two-arm, parallel, unblinded, cluster randomized controlled trial to quantify the overall efficacy of TIRS in reducing the burden of laboratory-confirmed ABV clinical disease (primary endpoint). The trial will be conducted in the city of Merida, Yucatan State, Mexico (population ~\u20091million), where we will prospectively follow 4600 children aged 2-15\u2009years at enrollment, distributed in 50 clusters of 5\u2009\u00d7\u20095 city blocks each. Clusters will be randomly allocated (n\u2009=\u200925 per arm) using covariate-constrained randomization. A \"fried egg\" design will be followed, in which all blocks of the 5\u2009\u00d7\u20095 cluster receive the intervention, but all sampling to evaluate the epidemiological and entomological endpoints will occur in the \"yolk,\" the center 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093 city blocks of each cluster. TIRS will be implemented as a preventive application (~\u20091-2\u2009months prior to the beginning of the ABV season). Active monitoring for symptomatic ABV illness will occur through weekly household visits and enhanced surveillance. Annual sero-surveys will be performed after each transmission season and entomological evaluations of Ae. aegypti indoor abundance and ABV infection rates monthly during the period of active surveillance. Epidemiological and entomological evaluation will continue for up to three transmission seasons.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04343521 . Registered on 13 April 2020.

A targeted HPV vaccination strategy would have substantial benefit for MSM in Vietnam.The median age of the study participants was 25 years (range 18-52). Overall prevalence of any HPV and HPV16\/18 infection were 32.3% and 11.0% respectively. A higher prevalence of high-risk HPV infection to all 14 types tested was found in Ho Chi Minh City 30.9%, than in Hanoi 18.4%. High-risk HPV infection was associated with inconsistent condom use and history of engaging in sex under the influence of drugs (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 2.27, 95% CI, 1.48-10.67), as well as having multiple sexual partners (aOR, 1.01, 95% CI, 1.00-1.02).A cross-sectional study of 799 MSM aged 16 to 50 years old was conducted in Vietnam in 2017-2018. Information on the risk behaviours, knowledge of HPV and anal cancer, rectal swabs to detect anal HPV infection were collected. An in-house polymerase chain reaction and Genoflow HPV array test kit were used for HPV detection and genotyping.Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at risk of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers, while published data are scarce. We determined HPV prevalence and risk factors in MSM in Vietnam to inform HPV prevention strategies in this key population.","975":"We found a positive correlation between the number of successful approved trials and interdisciplinary collaborations measured by a collaboration diversity metric (P\u2009<\u2009.01).

Large pharmaceutical companies have the lowest local clustering coefficient and more diversity in partnerships across biomedical specializations.We constructed a temporal network of clinical trial collaborations between large and small-size pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, hospital systems, and government agencies from public and proprietary data and introduced metrics to quantify actors' collaboration network structure, organizational behavior, and partnership characteristics. A multivariable regression analysis was conducted to determine the metrics' relationship with success.Large pharmaceutical companies are more likely to collaborate with a wider range of actors from other specialties, especially smaller industry actors who are newcomers in clinical research, resulting in exclusive access to smaller actors. Future investigations are needed to show how concentrations of influence and resources might result in diminished gains in treatment development.Clinical trials ensure that pharmaceutical treatments are safe, efficacious, and effective for public consumption, but are extremely complex, taking up to 10 years and $2.6 billion to complete. One main source of complexity arises from the collaboration between actors, and network science methodologies can be leveraged to explore that complexity. We aim to characterize collaborations between actors in the clinical trials context and investigate trends of successful actors.","976":"The OTTC consisted of training modules covering topics including tick biology, tick identification, tick-borne diseases, and public health, personal tick safety, and tick surveillance. The course was largely promoted to vector control specialists and public health employees throughout the Southeastern US. We collected assessment and survey data on participants to gauge learning outcomes, perceptions of the utility of knowledge gained, and barriers and facilitators to applying the knowledge in the field.Overall, this OTTC demonstrated capacity to improve knowledge in a necessary and underserved public health field, and more than half of participants use or plan to use the information in their work. The geographic reach of this online resource was much larger than simply for the Southeastern region for which it was designed, suggesting a much broader need for this resource. Understanding the utility and penetrance of training programs such as these is important for refining materials and assessing optimal targets for training.Tick-borne diseases are a growing public health threat in the United States. Despite the prevalence and rising burden of tick-borne diseases, there are major gaps in baseline knowledge and surveillance efforts for tick vectors, even among vector control districts and public health agencies. To address this issue, an online tick training course (OTTC) was developed through the Southeastern Center of Excellence in Vector-Borne Diseases (SECOEVBD) to provide a comprehensive knowledge base on ticks, tick-borne diseases, and their management.The OTTC was successful in increasing participants' baseline knowledge across all course subject areas, with the average score on assessment increasing from 62.6% (pre-course) to 86.7% (post-course). More than half of participants (63.6%) indicated that they would definitely use information from the course in their work. Barriers to using information identified in the delayed assessment included lack of opportunities to apply skills (18.5%) and the need for additional specialized training beyond what the OTTC currently offers (18.5%), while the main facilitator (70.4%) for applying knowledge was having opportunities at work, such as an existing tick surveillance program.","977":"As wildfire frequency and severity increases, smoke exposures will cause increasingly more adverse respiratory effects. While acute respiratory effects of smoke exposure have been documented in children, longer term sequelae are largely unstudied. Our objective here was to examine the association between gestational and postnatal exposure to wildfire smoke and prolonged use of prescription medication for respiratory conditions in early childhood. Using Merative MarketScan claims data, we created cohorts of term children born in western states between 1 January 2010-31 December 2014 followed for at least three years. Using NOAA Hazard Mapping System data, we determined the average number of days a week that >25% of the population in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) was covered by smoke within each exposure period. The exposure periods were defined by trimester and two 12 week postnatal periods. Medication use was based on respiratory indication (upper respiratory, lower respiratory, or any respiratory condition) and categorized into outcomes of prolonged use (\u2a7e30 d use) (PU) and multiple prolonged uses (at least two prolonged uses) (MPU). We used logistic regression models with random intercepts for MSAs adjusted for child sex, birth season, and birth year. Associations differed by exposure period and respiratory outcome, with elevated risk of MPU of lower respiratory medications following exposure in the third trimester and the first 12 postnatal weeks (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.98, 1.35; RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.05, 1.40, respectively). Exposure in the third trimester was associated with an increase in MPU of any respiratory among males infants only (male RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.00, 1.50; female RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.66, 1.31). Through novel use of prescription claims data, this work identifies critical developmental windows in the 3rd trimester and first 12 postnatal weeks during which environmental inhalational disaster events may impact longer-term respiratory health.","978":"Progesterone and testosterone were significantly negatively associated with the frequency of sleep disturbances and insomnia. Free testosterone index was also negatively associated with insomnia frequency. E2:progesterone was positively associated with frequency of sleep disturbances and restless sleep in self-reported nonsmokers. SumPCP and sumALL were significantly negatively associated with frequency of sleep disturbances, insomnia, and restless sleep. SumDEHP and sumPLASTIC were negatively associated with insomnia frequency. Further, the direction of association between phthalates and sleep appears to be dependent on the quartile of phthalate exposure. All significant associations between phthalates and sleep were in self-reported nonsmokers or former smokers.Our study supports previous literature that hormones beyond follicle-stimulating hormone and E2 are associated with sleep disruptions in menopause. Further, we are among the first to show that phthalate exposure is associated with sleep disruptions in midlife women.In total, 762 women (aged 45-54 y, 459 premenopausal, and 303 perimenopausal) from the Midlife Women's Health Study answered self-reported questions regarding the frequency of sleep disturbances, insomnia, and restless sleep. Serum E2, progesterone, testosterone, serum hormone binding globulin, free E2 index, free testosterone index, E2:progesterone, and E2:testosterone were measured. Summary measures of phthalate mixtures, including the phthalates from plastic sources (sumPLASTIC), personal care products (sumPCP), di-(2-ethyhexyl) phthalate (sumDEHP), anti-androgenic phthalates (sumAA), and all phthalate metabolites measured (sumALL), were calculated from urinary phthalate metabolites. Ordinal logistic regression was used to fit each outcome sleep measure with all hormones and summary phthalates.Follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol (E2) have been associated with sleep in midlife women, however, few studies have examined the association of other hormones or environmental chemical exposure such as phthalates, with self-reported sleep quality. We assessed the relationship of self-reported sleep with hormones and phthalates.","979":"Estimates of number of women who have undergone induced abortion in jurisdictions with restrictive abortion laws are still scarce in the scientific literature, and the disparate estimates from currently used methods call for the application of innovative estimation techniques such as new indirect methods. This need is especially acute in more densely populated areas, such as Brazil's state capitals, given the magnitude of unsafe abortions and the resulting risks and harms. The article aims to estimate the number of women who had induced abortions in the city of Rio de Janeiro in 2011, based on a Bayesian hierarchical model. The model was applied to data from a household survey that supported the use of the network scale-up method in the city of Rio de Janeiro, a Bayesian hierarchical model using indirect information based on the contact networks of randomly selected participants from the general population. Among the 1,758,145 women 15-49 years of age living in the city of Rio de Janeiro, 13,025 women (95%CrI: 10,635; 15,748) had induced abortions in 2011, resulting in a mean cumulative incidence of 7.41 (95%CrI: 6.05; 8.96) for every 1,000 women 15-49 years of age. The model's self-validation process identified patterns of underestimation in stigmatized subpopulations with low social visibility, such as women who have undergone induced abortion. Induced abortion is a common practice among women in the city of Rio de Janeiro. New indirect estimation methods can contribute to more precise measurement of this event, considering the context of illegality, and thereby contribute to appropriate health policies.","980":"The novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread around the world, causing serious illness and death and creating a heavy burden on the healthcare systems of many countries. Since the virus first emerged in late November 2019, its spread has coincided with peak circulation of several seasonal respiratory viruses, yet some studies have noted limited coinfections between SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. We use a mathematical model of viral coinfection to study SARS-CoV-2 coinfections, finding that SARS-CoV-2 replication is easily suppressed by many common respiratory viruses. According to our model, this suppression is because SARS-CoV-2 has a lower growth rate (1.8\/d) than the other viruses examined in this study. The suppression of SARS-CoV-2 by other pathogens could have implications for the timing and severity of a second wave.","981":"Dermacentor variabilis, a common human-biting tick found throughout the eastern half and along the west coast of the United States, is a vector of multiple bacterial pathogens. Historically, D. variabilis has been considered a primary vector of Rickettsia rickettsii, the causative agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. A total of 883 adult D. variabilis, collected between 2012 and 2017 from various locations in 12 states across the United States, were screened for rickettsial DNA. Tick extracts were evaluated using three real-time PCR assays; an R. rickettsii-specific assay, a Rickettsia bellii-specific assay, and a Rickettsia genus-specific assay. Sequencing of ompA gene amplicons generated using a seminested PCR assay was used to determine the rickettsial species present in positive samples not already identified by species-specific real-time assays. A total of 87 (9.9%) tick extracts contained R. bellii DNA and 203 (23%) contained DNA of other rickettsial species, including 47 (5.3%) with Rickettsia montanensis, 11 (1.2%) with Rickettsia amblyommatis, 2 (0.2%) with Rickettsia rhipicephali, and 3 (0.3%) with Rickettsia parkeri. Only 1 (0.1%) tick extract contained DNA of R. rickettsii. These data support multiple other contemporary studies that indicate infrequent detection of R. rickettsii in D. variabilis in North America.","982":"To evaluate whether the month or season of conception is associated with CP occurrence.The month and season of conception were estimated based on the child's date of birth and the length of gestation recorded in the California birth records.CP status was ascertained from the diagnostic records obtained from the Department of Developmental Services in California. Poisson regression was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) and 95% CI for CP according to the month or the season of conception, adjusting for maternal- and neighborhood-level factors. Stratified analyses were conducted by child's sex and neighborhood social vulnerability measures, and the mediating role of preterm birth was evaluated.Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most prevalent neuromotor disability in childhood, but for most cases the etiology remains unexplained. Seasonal variation in the conception of CP may provide clues for their potential etiological risk factors that vary across seasons.In this cohort study in California, children conceived in winter and spring had a small increase in CP risk. These findings suggest that seasonally varying environmental factors should be considered in the etiological research of CP.Records of 4\u202f468\u202f109 children (51.2% male; maternal age: 28.3% aged 19 to 25 years, 27.5% aged 26 to 30 years; maternal race and ethnicity: 5.6% African American or Black, 13.5% Asian, 49.8% Hispanic or Latinx of any race, and 28.3% non-Hispanic White) and 4697 with CP (55.1% male; maternal age: 28.3% aged 19 to 25 years, 26.0% aged 26 to 30 years; maternal race and ethnicity: 8.3% African American or Black, 8.6% Asian, 54.3% Hispanic or Latinx of any race, and 25.8% non-Hispanic White) were analyzed. Children conceived in winter (January to March) or spring (April to June) were associated with a 9% to 10% increased risk of CP (winter: RR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.01-1.19]; spring: RR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.02-1.20]) compared with summer (July to September) conceptions. Analyses for specific months showed similar results with children conceived in January, February, and May being at higher risk of CP. The associations were slightly stronger for mothers who lived in neighborhoods with a high social vulnerability index, but no child sex differences were observed. Only a small portion of the estimated association was mediated through preterm birth.This statewide cohort study examined more than 4 million live births that were registered in the California birth records during 2007 to 2015 and were linked to CP diagnostic records (up to year 2021). Statistical analyses were conducted between March 2022 and January 2023.","983":"In the absence of effective treatments or a vaccine, social distancing has been the only public health measure available to combat the COVID-19 pandemic to date. In the US, implementing this response has been left to state, county, and city officials, and many localities have issued some form of a stay-at-home order. Without existing tools and with limited resources, localities struggled to understand how their orders changed behavior. In response, several technology companies opened access to their users' location data. As part of the COVID-19 Data Mobility Data Network, we obtained access to Facebook User data and developed four key metrics and visualizations to monitor various aspects of adherence to stay at home orders. These metrics were carefully incorporated into static and interactive visualizations for dissemination to local officials.

However, exposure to MTVShuga-DS was low. Given these positive indications, supportive programming may be required to raise exposure and allow future evaluation of edu-drama impact in this setting.Within the rural cohort 2184 (85.5%) of eligible sampled individuals were enrolled, of whom 92.6% had at least one follow-up visit; the urban cross-sectional surveys enrolled 4127 (22.6%) of eligible sampled individuals. Self-report of watching at least one MTV Shuga-DS episode was 14.1% (cohort) and 35.8% (cross-section), while storyline recall was 5.5% (cohort) and 6.7% (cross-section). In the cohort, after adjustment (for HIV-prevention intervention-exposure, age, education, socioeconomic status), MTVShuga-DS exposure was associated with increased PrEP awareness (adjusted OR (aOR) 2.06, 95% CI 1.57 to 2.70), contraception uptake (aOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.98) and consistent condom use (aOR 1.84, 95%\u2009CI 1.24 to 2.93), but not with HIV testing (aOR 1.02, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.21) or acquiring HSV-2 (aOR 0.92, 95%\u2009CI 0.61 to 1.38).

Western Europe was initially one of the worst-hit regions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Western European countries deployed a range of policy responses to the pandemic, which were often informed by mathematical, computational, and statistical models. Models differed in terms of temporal scope, pandemic stage, interventions modeled, and analytical form. This diversity was modulated by differences in data availability and quality, government interventions, societal responses, and technical capacity. Many of these models were decisive to policy making at key junctures, such as during the introduction of vaccination and the emergence of the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants. However, models also faced intense criticism from the press, other scientists, and politicians around their accuracy and appropriateness for decision making. Hence, evaluating the success of models in terms of accuracy and influence is an essential task. Modeling needs to be supported by infrastructure for systems to collect and share data, model development, and collaboration between groups, as well as two-way engagement between modelers and both policy makers and the public.","986":"Yellow fever (YF) is a viral, vector-borne, haemorrhagic fever endemic in tropical regions of Africa and South America. The vaccine for YF is considered safe and effective, but intervention strategies need to be optimised; one of the tools for this is mathematical modelling. We refine and expand an existing modelling framework for Africa to account for transmission in South America. We fit to YF occurrence and serology data. We then estimate the subnational forces of infection for the entire endemic region. Finally, using demographic and vaccination data, we examine the impact of vaccination activities. We estimate that there were 109,000 (95% credible interval [CrI] [67,000-173,000]) severe infections and 51,000 (95% CrI [31,000-82,000]) deaths due to YF in Africa and South America in 2018. We find that mass vaccination activities in Africa reduced deaths by 47% (95% CrI [10%-77%]). This methodology allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination and illustrates the need for continued vigilance and surveillance of YF.","987":") consisting of seven social groups. We show that social group membership is clearly reflected in the microbiomes of individual sifaka, and that social groups with denser grooming networks have more homogeneous gut microbial compositions. Within social groups, adults, more gregarious individuals, and individuals that scent-mark frequently harbour the greatest microbial diversity. Thus, the community structure of wild lemurs governs symbiotic relationships by constraining transmission between hosts and partitioning environmental exposure to microorganisms. This social cultivation of mutualistic gut flora may be an evolutionary benefit of tight-knit group living.","988":"Whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing have facilitated the large-scale discovery of de novo variants in human disease. To date, most de novo discovery through next-generation sequencing focused on congenital heart disease and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Currently, de novo variants are one of the most significant risk factors for NDDs with a substantial overlap of genes involved in more than one NDD. To facilitate better usage of published data, provide standardization of annotation, and improve accessibility, we created denovo-db (http:\/\/denovo-db.gs.washington.edu), a database for human de novo variants. As of July 2016, denovo-db contained 40 different studies and 32,991 de novo variants from 23,098 trios. Database features include basic variant information (chromosome location, change, type); detailed annotation at the transcript and protein levels; severity scores; frequency; validation status; and, most importantly, the phenotype of the individual with the variant. We included a feature on our browsable website to download any query result, including a downloadable file of the full database with additional variant details. denovo-db provides necessary information for researchers to compare their data to other individuals with the same phenotype and also to controls allowing for a better understanding of the biology of de novo variants and their contribution to disease.","989":"We show the role that repetitive testing can play in transmission mitigation, reducing community spread, and maintaining in-person education. We identified that distantly related lineages were brought to the area after spring break travel regardless of the presence of a dominant variant of concern.We examined the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate and changes in variant lineages before and after the university spring break for two consecutive years. 155 samples were sequenced across four time periods: pre- and post-spring break 2021 and pre- and post-spring break 2022; following whole genome sequencing, samples were assigned clades. The clades were then paired with positivity and testing data from over 50,000 samples.University spring break carries a two-pronged SARS-CoV-2 variant transmission risk. Circulating variants from universities can spread to spring break destinations, and variants from spring break destinations can spread to universities and surrounding communities. Therefore, it is critical to implement SARS-CoV-2 variant surveillance and testing strategies to limit community spread before and after spring break to mitigate virus transmission and facilitate universities safely returning to in-person teaching.In 2021, the number of variants in the observed population increased from four to nine over spring break, with variants of concern being responsible for most of the cases; Alpha percent composition increased from 22.2% to 56.4%. In 2022, the number of clades in the population increased only from two to three, all of which were Omicron or a sub-lineage of Omicron. However, phylogenetic analysis showed the emergence of distantly related sub-lineages. 2022 saw a greater increase in positivity than 2021, which coincided with a milder mitigation strategy. Analysis of social media data provided insight into student travel destinations and how those travel events may have impacted spread.","990":"The repeatability of adaptive radiation is expected to be scale-dependent, with determinism decreasing as greater spatial separation among \"replicates\" leads to their increased genetic and ecological independence. Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) provide an opportunity to test whether this expectation holds for the early stages of adaptive radiation-their diversification in freshwater ecosystems has been replicated many times. To better understand the repeatability of that adaptive radiation, we examined the influence of geographic scale on levels of parallel evolution by quantifying phenotypic and genetic divergence between lake and stream stickleback pairs sampled at regional (Vancouver Island) and global (North America and Europe) scales. We measured phenotypes known to show lake-stream divergence and used reduced representation genome-wide sequencing to estimate genetic divergence. We assessed the scale dependence of parallel evolution by comparing effect sizes from multivariate models and also the direction and magnitude of lake-stream divergence vectors. At the phenotypic level, parallelism was greater at the regional than the global scale. At the genetic level, putative selected loci showed greater lake-stream parallelism at the regional than the global scale. Generally, the level of parallel evolution was low at both scales, except for some key univariate traits. Divergence vectors were often orthogonal, highlighting possible ecological and genetic constraints on parallel evolution at both scales. Overall, our results confirm that the repeatability of adaptive radiation decreases at increasing spatial scales. We suggest that greater environmental heterogeneity at larger scales imposes different selection regimes, thus generating lower repeatability of adaptive radiation at larger spatial scales.","991":"There are many outstanding questions about how to control the global COVID-19 pandemic. The information void has been especially stark in the World Health Organization Africa Region, which has low per capita reported cases, low testing rates, low access to therapeutic drugs, and has the longest wait for vaccines. As with all disease, the central challenge in responding to COVID-19 is that it requires integrating complex health systems that incorporate prevention, testing, front line health care, and reliable data to inform policies and their implementation within a relevant timeframe. It requires that the population can rely on the health system, and decision-makers can rely on the data. To understand the process and challenges of such an integrated response in an under-resourced rural African setting, we present the COVID-19 strategy in Ifanadiana District, where a partnership between Malagasy Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) and non-governmental organizations integrates prevention, diagnosis, surveillance, and treatment, in the context of a model health system. These efforts touch every level of the health system in the district-community, primary care centers, hospital-including the establishment of the only RT-PCR lab for SARS-CoV-2 testing outside of the capital. Starting in March of 2021, a second wave of COVID-19 occurred in Madagascar, but there remain fewer cases in Ifanadiana than for many other diseases (e.g., malaria). At the Ifanadiana District Hospital, there have been two deaths that are officially attributed to COVID-19. Here, we describe the main components and challenges of this integrated response, the broad epidemiological contours of the epidemic, and how complex data sources can be developed to address many questions of COVID-19 science. Because of data limitations, it still remains unclear how this epidemic will affect rural areas of Madagascar and other developing countries where health system utilization is relatively low and there is limited capacity to diagnose and treat COVID-19 patients. Widespread population based seroprevalence studies are being implemented in Ifanadiana to inform the COVID-19 response strategy as health systems must simultaneously manage perennial and endemic disease threats.","992":"Existing composite measures assess the extent to which women and men support masculinity ideals concerning the expectation that men should provide for their partners and families. In many contexts across sub-Saharan Africa, the male provider role is taken as given. This core masculinity tenet may be associated with related gender role expectations that result in increasing young women's risk of HIV, especially within the context of transactional sex relationships. Extant literature points to five domains potentially associated with male provider role expectations: male authority, men's sexual decision-making control, women's sexual agency, women's economic dependence, and love. The goal of this study was to develop the Gender Roles and Male Provision Expectations (GRMPE) scale toward understanding whether beliefs attached to male provider role expectations increase HIV risk. We developed the GRMPE across three research phases with young women (ages 15-24) in Central Uganda that (1) used qualitative data to refine domains and develop scale items; (2) cognitively tested the refined items; and (3) pilot tested a 26-item scale across five domains with 108 young women. Using confirmatory factor analyses, we retained 15 items across four factors, corresponding to the domains of male authority, sexual decision-making, women's sexual agency, and love; which we then modeled as indicators in a single second-order factor model. The GRMPE demonstrated initial reliability and validity, and tests of criterion validity found significant associations with known HIV risk behaviors. The GRMPE scale shows promise for better examining the determinants of HIV risk and assessing gender norm change interventions.","993":"Social unrest is endemic in many societies, and recent news has drawn attention to happenings in Latin America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Civilian populations mobilize, sometimes spontaneously and sometimes in an organized manner, to raise awareness of key issues or to demand changes in governing or other organizational structures. It is of key interest to social scientists and policy makers to forecast civil unrest using indicators observed on media such as Twitter, news, and blogs. We present an event forecasting model using a notion of activity cascades in Twitter (proposed by Gonzalez-Bailon et al., 2011) to predict the occurrence of protests in three countries of Latin America: Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela. The basic assumption is that the emergence of a suitably detected activity cascade is a precursor or a surrogate to a real protest event that will happen \"on the ground.\" Our model supports the theoretical characterization of large cascades using spectral properties and uses properties of detected cascades to forecast events. Experimental results on many datasets, including the recent June 2013 protests in Brazil, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. ","994":"Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are routinely employed in clinical settings to improve quality of care, ensure patient safety, and deliver consistent medical care. However, rule-based CDSS, currently available, do not feature reusable rules. In this study, we present CDSS with reusable rules. Our solution includes a common CDSS module, electronic medical record (EMR) specific adapters, CDSS rules written in the clinical quality language (CQL) (derived from CDC immunization recommendations), and patient records in fast healthcare interoperability resources (FHIR) format. The proposed CDSS is entirely browser-based and reachable within the user's EMR interface at the client-side. This helps to avoid the transmission of patient data and privacy breaches. Additionally, we propose to provide means of managing and maintaining CDSS rules to allow the end users to modify them independently. Successful implementation and deployment were achieved in OpenMRS and OpenEMR during initial testing.","995":"Digital images from surgically resected tissues from 89 PanNET patients were used. Pathologist-annotated regions were extracted to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify tiles consisting of PanNET, stroma, normal pancreas parenchyma, and fat. Computationally annotated cancer or stroma tiles and patient metastasis status were used to train CNN to calculate a region based metastatic risk score. Aggregation of the metastatic probability scores across the slide was performed to predict the risk of metastasis.Using slides from surgically resected PanNETs, our novel, multiclassification, deep learning pipeline was able to predict the risk of metastasis in PanNET patients. Our results suggest the presence of prognostic morphological patterns in PanNET tissues, and that these patterns may help guide clinical decision making.The prognosis of patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNET), the second most common type of pancreatic cancer, varies significantly, and up to 15% of patients develop metastasis. Although certain morphological characteristics of PanNETs have been associated with patient outcome, there are no available morphology-based prognostic markers. Given that current clinical histopathology markers are unable to identify high-risk PanNET patients, the development of accurate prognostic biomarkers is needed. Here, we describe a novel machine learning, multiclassification pipeline to predict the risk of metastasis using morphological information from whole tissue slides.The ability of CNN to discriminate different tissues was high (per-tile accuracy >95%; whole slide cancer regions Jaccard index = 79%). Cancer and stromal tiles with high evaluated probability provided F1 scores of 0.82 and 0.69, respectively, when we compared tissues from patients who developed metastasis and those who did not. The final model identified low-risk (n = 76) and high-risk (n = 13) patients, as well as predicted metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio: 4.71) after adjusting for common clinicopathological variables, especially in grade I\/II patients.","996":"Surveillance data on laboratory-confirmed SFTS cases in China were collected. The spatiotemporal dynamics and epidemiological features were explored. The socioeconomic and environmental drivers were identified for SFTS diffusion using survival analysis and for SFTS persistence using a two-stage generalized boosted regression tree model.Surveillance of SFTS and intervention programs need to be targeted at areas with ecologically suitability for vector ticks and in the vicinity of migratory birds to curb the growing epidemic.During 2010\u20122018, a total of 7,721 laboratory-confirmed SFTS cases were reported in China, with an overall CFR of 10.5%. The average annual incidence increased >20 times and endemic areas expanded from 27 to 1,574 townships, whereas the CFR declined from 19% to 10% during this period. Four geographical clusters, the Changbai Mountain area, the Jiaodong Peninsula, the Taishan Mountain area and the Huaiyangshan Mountain area, were identified. Diffusion and persistence of the disease were both driven by elevation, high coverages of woods, crops and shrub, and the vicinity of habitats of migratory birds, but had different meteorological drivers. Residents \u226560 years old in rural areas with crop fields and tea farms were at increased risk to SFTS.The growing epidemics of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), an emerging tick-borne disease in East Asia, and its high case fatality rate have raised serious public health concerns.","997":"In this paper, we performed a retrospective analysis using longitudinal sequencing data to characterize differences in the speed, calendar timing, and magnitude of 16 SARS-CoV-2 variant waves\/transitions for 230 countries and sub-country regions, between October 2020 and January 2023. We then clustered geographic locations in terms of their variant behavior across several Omicron variants, allowing us to identify groups of locations exhibiting similar variant transitions. Finally, we explored relationships between heterogeneity in these variant waves and time-varying factors, including vaccination status of the population, governmental policy, and the number of variants in simultaneous competition.Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD), Los Alamos National Laboratory.These results suggest the behavior of an emergent variant may be sensitive to the immunologic and demographic context of its location. Additionally, this work represents the most comprehensive characterization of variant transitions globally to date.This work demonstrates associations between the behavior of an emerging variant and the number of co-circulating variants as well as the demographic context of the population. We also observed an association between high vaccination rates and variant transition dynamics prior to the Mu and Delta variant transitions.Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has continued to evolve, with new variants outcompeting existing variants and often leading to different dynamics of disease spread.","998":"Successful infectious disease interventions can result in large reductions in parasite prevalence. Such demographic change has fitness implications for individual parasites and may shift the parasite's optimal life history strategy. Here, we explore whether declining infection rates can alter Plasmodium falciparum's investment in sexual versus asexual growth. Using a multiscale mathematical model, we demonstrate how the proportion of polyclonal infections, which decreases as parasite prevalence declines, affects the optimal sexual development strategy: Within-host competition in multiclone infections favors a greater investment in asexual growth whereas single-clone infections benefit from higher conversion to sexual forms. At the same time, drug treatment also imposes selection pressure on sexual development by shortening infection length and reducing within-host competition. We assess these models using 148 P. falciparum parasite genomes sampled in French Guiana over an 18-y period of intensive intervention (1998 to 2015). During this time frame, multiple public health measures, including the introduction of new drugs and expanded rapid diagnostic testing, were implemented, reducing P. falciparum malaria cases by an order of magnitude. Consistent with this prevalence decline, we see an increase in the relatedness among parasites, but no single clonal background grew to dominate the population. Analyzing individual allele frequency trajectories, we identify genes that likely experienced selective sweeps. Supporting our model predictions, genes showing the strongest signatures of selection include transcription factors involved in the development of P. falciparum's sexual gametocyte form. These results highlight how public health interventions impose wide-ranging selection pressures that affect basic parasite life history traits.","999":"A generic modeling framework to infer the failure-spreading process based on failure times of individual nodes is proposed and tested in four simulation studies: one for cascading failures in interdependent power and transportation networks, one for influenza epidemics, one benchmark test case for congestion cascade in a transportation network, and one benchmark test case for cascading power outages. Four general failure-spreading mechanisms-external, temporal, spatial, and functional-are quantified to capture what drives the spreading of failures. With the failure time of each node given, the proposed methodology demonstrates remarkable capability of inferring the underlying general failure-spreading mechanisms and accurately reconstructing the failure-spreading process in all four simulation studies. The analysis of the two benchmark test cases also reveals the robustness of the proposed methodology: It is shown that a failure-spreading process embedded by specific failure-spreading mechanisms such as flow redistribution can be captured with low uncertainty by our model. The proposed methodology thereby presents a promising channel for providing a generally applicable framework for modeling, understanding, and controlling failure spreading in a variety of systems.","1000":"The impact of a public health intervention (mass drug administration for malaria) was modelled, for different levels of connectedness between populations that have similar disease epidemiology (e.g., two nearby villages which have similar baseline malaria incidences and similar malaria intervention measures), or between populations of varying disease epidemiology (e.g., two nearby villages which have different baseline malaria incidences and\/or malaria intervention measures).The connectedness of intervention units or populations is an important factor to be considered to achieve success in public health interventions that could provide herd effects. Appreciating the assembly effect can improve the cost-effective strategies for global disease elimination projects.Many public health interventions lead to disruption or decrease of transmission, providing a beneficial effect for people in the population regardless of whether or not they individually participate in the intervention. This protective benefit has been referred to as a herd or community effect and is dependent on sufficient population participation. In practice, public health interventions are implemented at different spatial scales (i.e., at the village, district, or provincial level). Populations, however defined (i.e., neighbourhoods, villages, districts) are frequently connected to other populations through human movement or travel, and this connectedness can influence potential herd effects.The overall impact of the interventions deployed could be influenced either positively (adding value to the intervention) or negatively (reducing the impact of the intervention) by how much the intervention units are connected with each other (e.g., how frequent people go to the other village or town) and how different the disease intensity between them are. This phenomenon is termed the \"assembly effect\", and it is a meta-population version of the more commonly understood \"herd effect\".","1001":"To escape immune recognition in previously infected hosts, viruses evolve genetically in immunologically important regions. The host's immune system responds by generating new memory cells recognizing the mutated viral strains. Despite recent advances in data collection and analysis, it remains conceptually unclear how epidemiology, immune response, and evolutionary factors interact to produce the observed speed of evolution and the incidence of infection. Here we establish a general and simple relationship between long-term cross-immunity, genetic diversity, speed of evolution, and incidence. We develop an analytic method fusing the standard epidemiological susceptible-infected-recovered approach and the modern virus evolution theory. The model includes the factors of strain selection due to immune memory cells, random genetic drift, and clonal interference effects. We predict that the distribution of recovered individuals in memory serotypes creates a moving fitness landscape for the circulating strains which drives antigenic escape. The fitness slope (effective selection coefficient) is proportional to the reproductive number in the absence of immunity R0 and inversely proportional to the cross-immunity distance a, defined as the genetic distance of a virus strain from a previously infecting strain conferring 50% decrease in infection probability. Analysis predicts that the evolution rate increases linearly with the fitness slope and logarithmically with the genomic mutation rate and the host population size. Fitting our analytic model to data obtained for influenza A H3N2 and H1N1, we predict the annual infection incidence within a previously estimated range, (4-7)%, and the antigenic mutation rate of Ub = (5 - 8) \u22c5 10(-4) per transmission event per genome. Our prediction of the cross-immunity distance of a = (14 - 15) aminoacid substitutions agrees with independent data for equine influenza.","1002":"New guidelines recommend that all HIV-infected individuals initiate antiretroviral treatment (ART) immediately following diagnosis. This study describes how immune reconstitution varies by gender and age to help identify poorly reconstituting subgroups and inform targeted testing initiatives.Longitudinal data from the outpatient monitoring system of the National AIDS Control Program in Tanzania.An asymptotic nonlinear mixed effects model was fit to post-treatment CD4+ cell count trajectories, allowing for fixed effects of age and sex, and an age by sex interaction.Older adults should initiate care early in disease progression because total immune reconstitution potential and rate of reconstitution appears to decrease with age. Targeted HIV testing and care linkage remains crucial for patient populations who tend to initiate treatment at lower CD4+ cell counts, including males and younger adults.Across 220,544 clinic visits from 32,069 HIV-infected patients, age- and sex-specific average CD4+ cell count at ART initiation ranged from 83-136 cells\/mm3, long term asymptotic CD4+ cell count ranged from 301-389 cells\/mm3, and time to half of maximal CD4+ reconstitution ranged from 3.57-5.68 months. CD4+ cell count at ART initiation and asymptotic CD4+ cell count were 1.28 (95% CI: 1.18-1.40) and 1.25 (95% CI: 1.20-1.31) times higher, respectively, for females compared to males in the youngest age group (19-29 years). Older patients started treatment at higher CD4+ counts but experienced slower CD4+ recovery than younger adults. Treatment initiation at greater CD4+ cell counts was correlated with greater asymptotic CD4+ cell counts within all sex and age groups.","1003":"We extend our established agent-based multiscale computational model of infection of lung tissue by SARS-CoV-2 to include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models of remdesivir. We model remdesivir treatment for COVID-19; however, our methods are general to other viral infections and antiviral therapies. We investigate the effects of drug potency, drug dosing frequency, treatment initiation delay, antiviral half-life, and variability in cellular uptake and metabolism of remdesivir and its active metabolite on treatment outcomes in a simulated patch of infected epithelial tissue. Non-spatial deterministic population models which treat all cells of a given class as identical can clarify how treatment dosage and timing influence treatment efficacy. However, they do not reveal how cell-to-cell variability affects treatment outcomes. Our simulations suggest that for a given treatment regime, including cell-to-cell variation in drug uptake, permeability and metabolism increase the likelihood of uncontrolled infection as the cells with the lowest internal levels of antiviral act as super-spreaders within the tissue. The model predicts substantial variability in infection outcomes between similar tissue patches for different treatment options. In models with cellular metabolic variability, antiviral doses have to be increased significantly (>50% depending on simulation parameters) to achieve the same treatment results as with the homogeneous cellular metabolism.","1004":"Scrub typhus (ST) is a life-threatening infectious disease if appropriate treatment is unavailable. Large discrepancy of clinical severity of ST patients was reported among age groups, and the underlying risk factors for severe disease are unclear.The disease severity rate is comparable between pediatric and elderly ST patients, while different clinical features and laboratory indicators were associated with development of severe complications for pediatric and elderly patients, which is helpful for diagnosis and progress assessment of disease for ST patients.A total of 2,074 ST patients including 209 pediatric patients and 1,865 elderly patients were included, with a comparable disease severity rate of 11.0% (95% CI 7.1%-16.1%) and 10.3% (95% CI 9.0%-11.8%). Different frequencies of clinical characteristics including lymphadenopathy, skin rash, enlarged tonsils, etc. were observed between pediatric and elderly patients. Presence of peripheral edema and decreased hemoglobin were the most important predictors of severe illness in pediatric patients with adjusted ORs by 38.99 (9.96-152.67, p<0.001) and 13.22 (1.54-113.50, p = 0.019), respectively, while presence of dyspnea and increased total bilirubin were the potential determinants of severe disease in elderly patients with adjusted ORs by 11.69 (7.33-18.64, p<0.001) and 3.17 (1.97-5.11, p<0.001), respectively. Compared with pediatric patients, elderly patients were more likely to receive doxycycline (64.8% v.s 9.9%, p<0.001), while less likely to receive azithromycin therapy (5.0% v.s 41.1%, p<0.001).Clinical and epidemiological data of ST patients were collected in 55 surveillance hospitals located in Guangzhou City, China, from 2012 to 2018. Severe prognosis and related factors were determined and compared between pediatric and elderly patients.","1005":"The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends pre-screening for past infection prior to administration of the only licensed dengue vaccine, CYD-TDV. Using a threshold modelling analysis, we identify settings where this guidance prohibits positive net-benefits, and are thus unfavourable. Generally, however, our model shows test-then-vaccinate strategies can improve CYD-TDV economic viability: effective testing reduces unnecessary vaccination costs while increasing health benefits. With sufficiently low testing cost, those trends outweigh additional screening costs, expanding the range of settings with positive net-benefits. This work highlights two aspects for further analysis of test-then-vaccinate strategies. We found that starting routine testing at younger ages could increase benefits; if real tests are shown to sufficiently address safety concerns, the manufacturer, regulators and WHO should revisit guidance restricting use to 9-years-and-older recipients. We also found that repeat testing could improve return-on-investment (ROI), despite increasing intervention costs. Thus, more detailed analyses should address questions on repeat testing and testing periodicity, in addition to real test sensitivity and specificity. Our results follow from a mathematical model relating ROI to epidemiology, intervention strategy, and costs for testing, vaccination and dengue infections. We applied this model to a range of strategies, costs and epidemiological settings pertinent to CYD-TDV. However, general trends may not apply locally, so we provide our model and analyses as an R package available via CRAN, denvax. To apply to their setting, decision-makers need only local estimates of age-specific seroprevalence and costs for secondary infections.","1006":"Endodontic treatment before periodontal therapy results in attachment gain.

Root canal treatment (RCT) was performed using standard methodology. Teeth of test groups were medicated with respective medicaments for 10 days before obturation. Scaling and root planning was done 1 month after completion of RCT in all the groups. Clinical measurements, including probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and bleeding on probing (BOP) were recorded at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months. Radiographic parameters, including periapical index (PAI) score and alveolar bone level, were measured at baseline and 6 months. < 0.05) was found in all the three groups from baseline to 6 months. However, there was no significant intergroup difference. No significant difference was observed from baseline to 6 months in marginal bone level within the three groups.Data were analyzed using Friedman test, Kruskal-Wallis, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test.The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of different intracanal medicaments used during endodontic treatment on periodontal attachment level in concurrent endodontic-periodontal lesions without communication.","1007":"Social network analysis is an invaluable tool to understand the patterns, evolution, and consequences of sociality. Comparative studies over a range of social systems across multiple taxonomic groups are particularly valuable. Such studies however require quantitative social association or interaction data across multiple species which is not easily available. We introduce the Animal Social Network Repository (ASNR) as the first multi-taxonomic repository that collates 790 social networks from more than 45 species, including those of mammals, reptiles, fish, birds, and insects. The repository was created by consolidating social network datasets from the literature on wild and captive animals into a consistent and easy-to-use network data format. The repository is archived at https:\/\/bansallab.github.io\/asnr\/ . ASNR has tremendous research potential, including testing hypotheses in the fields of animal ecology, social behavior, epidemiology and evolutionary biology.","1008":"We analyzed the laboratory and epidemiological records of patients with EVD confirmed by reverse transcription PCR hospitalized in the Conakry area, Guinea, between 1 March 2014 and 28 February 2015. We used viremia and other variables to model the CFR. Data for 699 EVD patients were analyzed. In the week following symptom onset, mean viremia remained stable, and the CFR increased with viremia, V, from 21% (95% CI 16%-27%) for low viremia (V < 104.4 copies\/ml) to 53% (95% CI 44%-61%) for intermediate viremia (104.4 \u2264 V < 105.2 copies\/ml) and 81% (95% CI 75%-87%) for high viremia (V \u2265 105.2 copies\/ml). Compared to adults (15-44 y old [y.o.]), the CFR was larger in young children (0-4 y.o.) (odds ratio [OR]: 2.44; 95% CI 1.02-5.86) and older adults (\u2265 45 y.o.) (OR: 2.84; 95% CI 1.81-4.46) but lower in children (5-14 y.o.) (OR: 0.46; 95% CI 0.24-0.86). An order of magnitude increase in mean viremia in cases after July 2014 compared to those before coincided with a 14% increase in the CFR. Our findings come from a large hospital-based study in Conakry and may not be generalizable to settings with different case profiles, such as with individuals who never sought care.Viremia in EVD patients was a strong predictor of death that partly explained variations in CFR in the study population. This study provides baseline CFRs by viremia group, which allow appropriate adjustment when estimating efficacy in treatment studies. In randomized controlled trials, stratifying analysis on viremia groups could reduce sample size requirements by 25%. We hypothesize that monitoring the viremia of hospitalized patients may inform the ability of surveillance systems to detect EVD patients from the different severity strata.The case fatality ratio (CFR) of Ebola virus disease (EVD) can vary over time and space for reasons that are not fully understood. This makes it difficult to define the baseline CFRs needed to evaluate treatments in the absence of randomized controls. Here, we investigate whether viremia in EVD patients may be used to evaluate baseline EVD CFRs.","1009":"There were 3 influenza pandemics in the 20th century, and there has been 1 so far in the 21st century. Local, national, and international health authorities regularly update their plans for mitigating the next influenza pandemic in light of the latest available evidence on the effectiveness of various control measures in reducing transmission. Here, we review the evidence base on the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical personal protective measures and environmental hygiene measures in nonhealthcare settings and discuss their potential inclusion in pandemic plans. Although mechanistic studies support the potential effect of hand hygiene or face masks, evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of these measures did not support a substantial effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza. We similarly found limited evidence on the effectiveness of improved hygiene and environmental cleaning. We identified several major knowledge gaps requiring further research, most fundamentally an improved characterization of the modes of person-to-person transmission.","1010":"Building realistically complex models of infectious disease transmission that are relevant for informing public health is conceptually challenging and requires knowledge of coding architecture that can implement key modeling conventions. For example, many of the models built to understand COVID-19 dynamics have included stochasticity, transmission dynamics that change throughout the epidemic due to changes in host behavior or public health interventions, and spatial structures that account for important spatio-temporal heterogeneities. Here we introduce an R package, SPARSEMODr, that allows users to simulate disease models that are stochastic and spatially explicit, including a model for COVID-19 that was useful in the early phases of the epidemic. SPARSEMOD stands for SPAtial Resolution-SEnsitive Models of Outbreak Dynamics, and our goal is to demonstrate particular conventions for rapidly simulating the dynamics of more complex, spatial models of infectious disease. In this report, we outline the features and workflows of our software package that allow for user-customized simulations. We believe the example models provided in our package will be useful in educational settings, as the coding conventions are adaptable, and will help new modelers to better understand important assumptions that were built into sophisticated COVID-19 models.","1011":" mosquito. Connectivity arising from human movement was more commonly assumed in studies using a mechanistic model, likely influenced by a lack of statistical models able to account for these connections. Although models have been increasing in complexity, it is important to select the most appropriate, parsimonious model available based on the research question, disease transmission process, the spatial scale and availability of data, and the way spatial connectivity is assumed to occur.","1012":"In 2017, more than half the cases of typhoid fever worldwide were projected to have occurred in India. In the absence of contemporary population-based data, it is unclear whether declining trends of hospitalization for typhoid in India reflect increased antibiotic treatment or a true reduction in infection.From 2017 through 2020, we conducted weekly surveillance for acute febrile illness and measured the incidence of typhoid fever (as confirmed on blood culture) in a prospective cohort of children between the ages of 6 months and 14 years at three urban sites and one rural site in India. At an additional urban site and five rural sites, we combined blood-culture testing of hospitalized patients who had a fever with survey data regarding health care use to estimate incidence in the community.A total of 24,062 children who were enrolled in four cohorts contributed 46,959 child-years of observation. Among these children, 299 culture-confirmed typhoid cases were recorded, with an incidence per 100,000 child-years of 576 to 1173 cases in urban sites and 35 in rural Pune. The estimated incidence of typhoid fever from hospital surveillance ranged from 12 to 1622 cases per 100,000 child-years among children between the ages of 6 months and 14 years and from 108 to 970 cases per 100,000 person-years among those who were 15 years of age or older. Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi was isolated from 33 children, for an overall incidence of 68 cases per 100,000 child-years after adjustment for age.The incidence of typhoid fever in urban India remains high, with generally lower estimates of incidence in most rural areas.

Mass drug administration (MDA), the presumptive antimalarial treatment of an entire population to clear the subclinical parasite reservoir, is a strategy to accelerate malaria elimination. We report a cluster randomised trial to assess the effectiveness of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) MDA in reducing falciparum malaria incidence and prevalence in 16 remote village populations in Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Lao People's Democratic Republic, where artemisinin resistance is prevalent.Added to community-based basic malaria control measures, 3 monthly rounds of DP MDA reduced the incidence and prevalence of falciparum malaria over a 1-year period in areas affected by artemisinin resistance. P. falciparum infections returned during the follow-up period as the remaining infections spread and malaria was reintroduced from surrounding areas. Limitations of this study include a relatively small sample of villages, heterogeneity between villages, and mobility of villagers that may have limited the impact of the intervention. These results suggest that, if used as part of a comprehensive, well-organised, and well-resourced elimination programme, DP MDA can be a useful additional tool to accelerate malaria elimination.After establishing vector control and community-based case management and following intensive community engagement, we used restricted randomisation within village pairs to select 8 villages to receive early DP MDA and 8 villages as controls for 12 months, after which the control villages received deferred DP MDA. The MDA comprised 3 monthly rounds of 3 daily doses of DP and, except in Cambodia, a single low dose of primaquine. We conducted exhaustive cross-sectional surveys of the entire population of each village at quarterly intervals using ultrasensitive quantitative PCR to detect Plasmodium infections. The study was conducted between May 2013 and July 2017. The investigators randomised 16 villages that had a total of 8,445 residents at the start of the study. Of these 8,445 residents, 4,135 (49%) residents living in 8 villages, plus an additional 288 newcomers to the villages, were randomised to receive early MDA; 3,790 out of the 4,423 (86%) participated in at least 1 MDA round, and 2,520 out of the 4,423 (57%) participated in all 3 rounds. The primary outcome, P. falciparum prevalence by month 3 (M3), fell by 92% (from 5.1% [171\/3,340] to 0.4% [12\/2,828]) in early MDA villages and by 29% (from 7.2% [246\/3,405] to 5.1% [155\/3,057]) in control villages. Over the following 9 months, the P. falciparum prevalence increased to 3.3% (96\/2,881) in early MDA villages and to 6.1% (128\/2,101) in control villages (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.41 [95% CI 0.20 to 0.84]; p = 0.015). Individual protection was proportional to the number of completed MDA rounds. Of 221 participants with subclinical P. falciparum infections who participated in MDA and could be followed up, 207 (94%) cleared their infections, including 9 of 10 with artemisinin- and piperaquine-resistant infections. The DP MDAs were well tolerated; 6 severe adverse events were detected during the follow-up period, but none was attributable to the intervention.","1014":"ISRCTN27581154 .Camino Verde (the Green Way) is an evidence-based community mobilisation tool for prevention of dengue and other mosquito-borne viral diseases.

The Nicaraguan arm of the trial was preceded, from 2004 to 2008, by a feasibility study that provided valuable lessons and trained facilitators for the trial itself. Here, guided by the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR), we describe the Camino Verde intervention in Nicaragua, presenting its rationale, its time and location, activities, materials used, the main actors, modes of delivery, how it was tailored to encourage community engagement, modifications made from the feasibility study to the trial itself, and how fidelity to the process originally designed was maintained. We also present information on costs and discuss the place of this study within the literature on implementation science.","1015":"Non-pharmaceutical interventions have been widely employed to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Their associated effect on SARS-CoV-2 transmission have however been unequally studied across regions. Few studies have focused on the Gulf states despite their potential role for global pandemic spread, in particular in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through religious pilgrimages. We study the association between NPIs and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the first pandemic wave between March and October 2020. We infer associations between NPIs introduction and lifting through a spatial SEIR-type model that allows for inferences of region-specific changes in transmission intensity. We find that reductions in transmission were associated with NPIs implemented shortly after the first reported case including Isolate and Test with School Closure (region-level mean estimates of the reduction in R0 ranged from 25-41%), Curfew (20-70% reduction), and Lockdown (50-60% reduction), although uncertainty in the estimates was high, particularly for the Isolate and Test with School Closure NPI (95% Credible Intervals from 1% to 73% across regions). Transmission was found to increase progressively in most regions during the last part of NPI relaxation phases. These results can help informing the policy makers in the planning of NPI scenarios as the pandemic evolves with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the availability of vaccination.","1016":"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection kinetics in immunodeficient mice reconstituted with humanized livers from inoculation to steady state is highly dynamic despite the absence of an adaptive immune response. To recapitulate the multiphasic viral kinetic patterns, we developed an agent-based model that includes intracellular virion production cycles reflecting the cyclic nature of each individual virus lifecycle. The model fits the data well predicting an increase in production cycles initially starting with a long production cycle of 1 virion per 20 hours that gradually reaches 1 virion per hour after approximately 3-4 days before virion production increases dramatically to reach to a steady state rate of 4 virions per hour per cell. Together, modeling suggests that it is the cyclic nature of the virus lifecycle combined with an initial slow but increasing rate of HBV production from each cell that plays a role in generating the observed multiphasic HBV kinetic patterns in humanized mice.","1017":"This study aimed to estimate the socio-economic costs of uncomplicated malaria and to explore health care-seeking behaviours that are likely to influence these costs in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a country ranked worldwide as the second most affected by malaria.Uncomplicated malaria is associated with high economic costs of care in the DRC. Efforts to reduce the cost-of-illness should target time lost at the pre-hospital stage and social disparities in the population, while reinforcing measures for malaria control in the country.In 2017, a cross-sectional survey included patients with uncomplicated malaria in 64 healthcare facilities from 10 sentinel sites of the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) in the DRC. A standard questionnaire was used to assess health care-seeking behaviours of patients. Health-related quality of life (HRQL) and disutility weights (DW) of illness were evaluated by using the EuroQol Group's descriptive system (EQ-5D-3L) and its visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). Malaria costs were estimated from a patient's perspective. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) evaluated the uncertainty around the cost estimates. Generalized regression models were fitted to assess the effect of potential predictive factors on the time lost and the DW during illness.In total, 1080 patients (age: 13.1\u2009\u00b1\u200914\u00a0years; M\/F ratio: 1.1) were included. The average total costs amounted to US$\u00a036.3 [95% CI 35.5-37.2] per malaria episode, including US$\u00a016.7 [95% CI 16.3-17.1] as direct costs and US$\u00a019.6 [95% CI 18.9-20.3] indirect costs. During care seeking, economically active patients and their relatives lost respectively 3.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 and 3.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1 working days. This time loss occurred mostly at the pre-hospital stage and was the parameter associated the most with the uncertainty around malaria cost estimates. Patients self-rated an average 0.36\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2 DW and an average 0.62\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3 EQ-5D index score per episode. A lack of health insurance coverage (896 out of 1080; 82.9%) incurred substantially higher costs, lower quality of life, and heavier DW while leading to longer time lost during illness. Residing in rural areas incurred a disproportionally higher socioeconomic burden of uncomplicated malaria with longer time lost due to illness and limited access to health insurance mechanisms.","1018":"Although airborne transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recognized, the condition of ventilation for its occurrence is still being debated. We analyzed a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak involving three families in a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, assessed the possibility of airborne transmission, and characterized the associated environmental conditions. We collected epidemiological data, obtained a full video recording and seating records from the restaurant, and measured the dispersion of a warm tracer gas as a surrogate for exhaled droplets from the index case. Computer simulations were performed to simulate the spread of fine exhaled droplets. We compared the in-room location of subsequently infected cases and spread of the simulated virus-laden aerosol tracer. The ventilation rate was measured using the tracer gas concentration decay method. This outbreak involved ten infected persons in three families (A, B, C). All ten persons ate lunch at three neighboring tables at the same restaurant on January 24, 2020. None of the restaurant staff or the 68 patrons at the other 15 tables became infected. During this occasion, the measured ventilation rate was 0.9\u00a0L\/s per person. No close contact or fomite contact was identified, aside from back-to-back sitting in some cases. Analysis of the airflow dynamics indicates that the infection distribution is consistent with a spread pattern representative of long-range transmission of exhaled virus-laden aerosols. Airborne transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is possible in crowded space with a ventilation rate of 1\u00a0L\/s per person.","1019":"We are motivated by a desire to make evolutionary analyses as simple as possible, and to close the disparity in the literature between genes which draw a significant amount of interest and those that are largely overlooked and underexplored.

Reliable forecasts of ILI can support better preparation for patient surges in healthcare systems. Although ILI is an amalgamation of multiple pathogens with variable seasonal phasing and attack rates, most existing process-based forecasting systems treat ILI as a single infectious agent. Here, using ILI records and virologic surveillance data, we show that ILI signal can be disaggregated into distinct viral components. We generate separate predictions for six contributing pathogens (influenza A\/H1, A\/H3, B, respiratory syncytial virus, and human parainfluenza virus types 1-2 and 3), and develop a method to forecast ILI by aggregating these predictions. The relative contribution of each pathogen to the total ILI signal is estimated using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method upon forecast aggregation. We find highly variable overall contributions from influenza type A viruses across seasons, but relatively stable contributions for the other pathogens. Using historical data from 1997 to 2014 at US national and regional levels, the proposed forecasting system generates improved predictions of both seasonal and near-term targets relative to a baseline method that simulates ILI as a single pathogen. The hierarchical forecasting system can generate predictions for each viral component, as well as infer and predict their contributions to ILI, which may additionally help physicians determine the etiological causes of ILI in clinical settings.","1021":"\u2009=\u2009254, 56.0%); had a college degree (n\u2009=\u2009431, 95.0%); and reported receiving influenza vaccine in preceding influenza season (n\u2009=\u2009297, 65.4%). Logistic regression model was statistically significant, X (16, N\u2009=\u2009450)\u2009=\u200931.6, p\u2009=\u2009.01. Education [(OR)\u2009=\u20090.3, 95%CI\u2009=\u20090.1-0.6)] and race (OR\u2009=\u20090.4, 95%CI\u2009=\u20090.2-0.8) were significant predictors of influenza vaccine acceptance among participants. The majority had favorable attitudes toward influenza vaccination and reported that physician recommendation would influence their vaccination decisions. Seven themes were identified in qualitative analysis: \"Protecting others\" (109, 24.0%), \"Protecting self\" (105, 23.1%), \"Vaccine accessibility\" (94, 20.7%), \"Education\/messaging\" (71, 15.6%), \"Policies\/requirements\" (15, 3.3%), \"Reminders\" (9, 2.0%), and \"Incentives\" (3, 0.7%). Our findings could facilitate the development of effective influenza vaccination promotion messages and programs for employers, and workplace vaccination programs for other diseases such as COVID-19, by public health authorities.","1022":"There was an incremental gain in quality-adjusted life-years with increasing screening frequency. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $783 per quality-adjusted life-year (every 4 weeks over no screening), $1861 per quality-adjusted life-year (every 3 weeks over every 4 weeks), $10,947 per quality-adjusted life-year (every 2 weeks over every 3 weeks), and $197,086 per quality-adjusted life-year (weekly over every 2 weeks). Findings were sensitive to screening cost, cost of hospitalization, postprophylaxis cytomegalovirus incidence, and graft loss after cytomegalovirus infection. No screening was favored when willingness to pay threshold was $185,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Screening every 2 weeks was the dominant strategy between willingness to pay range of $14,000-$185,000 per quality-adjusted life-year.Management strategies are unclear for late-onset cytomegalovirus infection occurring beyond 6 months of antiviral prophylaxis in cytomegalovirus high-risk (cytomegalovirus IgG positive to cytomegalovirus IgG negative) kidney transplant recipients. Hybrid strategies (prophylaxis followed by screening) have been investigated but with inconclusive results. There are clinical and potential cost benefits of preventing cytomegalovirus-related hospitalizations and associated increased risks of patient and graft failure. We used decision analysis to evaluate the utility of postprophylaxis screening for late-onset cytomegalovirus infection.We used the Markov decision analysis model incorporating costs and utilities for various cytomegalovirus clinical states (asymptomatic cytomegalovirus, mild cytomegalovirus infection, and cytomegalovirus infection necessitating hospitalization) to estimate cost-effectiveness of postprophylaxis cytomegalovirus screening strategies. Five strategies were compared: no screening and screening at 1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-week intervals. Progression to severe cytomegalovirus infection was modeled on cytomegalovirus replication kinetics. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated as a ratio of cost difference between two strategies to difference in quality-adjusted life-years starting with the low-cost strategy. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test model's robustness.In cytomegalovirus high-risk kidney transplant recipients, compared with no screening, screening for postprophylactic cytomegalovirus viremia is associated with gains in quality-adjusted life-years and seems to be cost effective. A strategy of screening every 2 weeks was the most cost-effective strategy across a wide range of willingness to pay thresholds.","1023":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, renewal equation estimates of time-varying effective reproduction numbers were useful to policymakers in evaluating the need for and impact of mitigation measures. Our objective here is to illustrate the utility of mechanistic expressions for the basic and effective (or intrinsic and realized) reproduction numbers, [Formula: see text] and related quantities derived from a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model including features of COVID-19 that might affect transmission of SARS-CoV-2, including asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and symptomatic infections, with which people may be hospitalized.

Santa Fe, a temperate province in Argentina, has experienced an increase in dengue cases and virus circulation since 2009, with the recent 2020 outbreak being the largest in the province to date. The aim of this work is to describe spatio-temporal fluctuations of dengue cases from 2009 to 2020 in Santa Fe Province. The data presented in this work provide a detailed description of DENV transmission for Santa Fe Province by department. These data are useful to assist in investigating drivers of dengue emergence in Santa Fe Province and for developing a better understanding of the drivers and the impacts of ongoing dengue emergence in temperate regions across the world. This work provides data useful for future studies including those investigating socio-ecological, climatic, and environmental factors associated with DENV transmission, as well as those investigating other variables related to the biology and the ecology of vector-borne diseases.","1025":"Motivation: Genotyping error can impact downstream single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analyses. Simulating various modes and levels of error can help investigators better understand potential biases caused by miscalled genotypes. Methods: We have developed and validated vcferr, a tool to probabilistically simulate genotyping error and missingness in variant call format (VCF) files. We demonstrate how vcferr could be used to address a research question by introducing varying levels of error of different type into a sample in a simulated pedigree, and assessed how kinship analysis degrades as a function of the kind and type of error. Software availability: vcferr is available for installation via PyPi (https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/vcferr\/) or conda (https:\/\/anaconda.org\/bioconda\/vcferr).

We used archival research to examine British and American attempts to control typhoid via sanitary interventions from the 1840s to 1940s. First, we assess how varying perceptions of typhoid and conflicts of interest led to a nonlinear evolution of control attempts in Oxford, United Kingdom. Our qualitative analysis shows how professional rivalries and tensions between Oxford's university and citizens (\"gown and town\"), as well as competing theories of typhoid proliferation stalled sanitary reform until the provision of cheap external credit created cross-party alliances at the municipal level. Second, we use historical mortality data to evaluate and quantify the impact of individual sanitary measures on typhoid transmission in major US cities. Together a historiographic and epidemiological study of past interventions provides insights for the planning of future sanitary programs.","1027":"In this randomized clinical trial, an AI-enabled decision aid significantly improved decision quality, level of SDM, satisfaction, and physical limitations without significantly impacting consultation times, TKR rates, or treatment concordance in patients with knee OA considering TKR. Decision aids using a personalized, data-driven approach can enhance SDM in the management of knee OA.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03956004.A total of 69 patients in the intervention group (46 [67%] women) and 60 patients in the control group (37 [62%] women) were included in the analysis. The intervention group showed better decisional quality (K-DQI mean difference, 20.0%; SE, 3.02; 95% CI, 14.2%-26.1%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), collaborative decision-making (CollaboRATE, 8 of 69 [12%] vs 28 of 60 [47%] patients below median; P\u2009<\u2009.001), satisfaction (numerical rating scale, 9 of 65 [14%] vs 19 of 58 [33%] patients below median; P\u2009=\u2009.01), and improved functional outcomes at 4 to 6 months (mean [SE] KOOS JR, 4.9 [2.24] points higher in intervention group; 95% CI, 0.8-9.0 points; P\u2009=\u2009.02). The intervention did not significantly affect consultation time (mean [SE] difference, 2.23 [2.18] minutes; P\u2009=\u2009.31), TKR rates (16 of 69 [23%] vs 7 of 60 [12%] patients; P\u2009=\u2009.11), or treatment concordance (58 of 69 [84%] vs 44 of 60 [73%] patients; P\u2009=\u2009.19).Decision aids can help inform appropriate selection of total knee replacement (TKR) for advanced knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, few decision aids combine patient education, preference assessment, and artificial intelligence (AI) using patient-reported outcome measurement data to generate personalized estimations of outcomes to augment shared decision-making (SDM).Patients were randomized into a group that received a decision aid including patient education, preference assessment, and personalized outcome estimations (intervention group) or a group receiving educational material only (control group) alongside usual care.The primary outcome was decision quality, measured using the Knee OA Decision Quality Instrument (K-DQI). Secondary outcomes were collaborative decision-making (assessed using the CollaboRATE survey), patient satisfaction with consultation (using a numerical rating scale), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Joint Replacement (KOOS JR) score, consultation time, TKR rate, and treatment concordance.This randomized clinical trial at a single US academic orthopedic practice included 129 new adult patients presenting for OA-related knee pain from March 2019 to January 2020. Data were analyzed from April to May 2020.To assess the effect of an AI-enabled patient decision aid that includes education, preference assessment, and personalized outcome estimations (using patient-reported outcome measurements) on decision quality, patient experience, functional outcomes, and process-level outcomes among individuals with advanced knee OA considering TKR in comparison with education only.","1028":"CDC guidance for containing MDROs, when used in combination with information on transfer of patients among hospitals, is predicted to be effective, enabling targeted and efficient use of prevention resources during an outbreak response. Even modestly effective infection-control measures may lead to a substantial reduction in transmission events.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently published interim guidance for a public health response to contain novel or targeted multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). We assessed the impact of implementing the strategy in a US state using a mathematical model.If additional infection-control interventions are assumed to lead to a 20% reduction in transmissibility in intervention facilities, prevalent case count in the state 3 years after importation would be reduced by 76% (interquartile range: 73-77%). During the third year, these additional infection-control measures would be applied in facilities accounting for 42% (37-46%) of inpatient days.We used a deterministic compartmental model, parametrized via a novel analysis of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae data reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network and patient transfer data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The simulations assumed that after the importation of the MDRO and its initial detection by clinical culture at an index hospital, fortnightly prevalence surveys for colonization and additional infection control interventions were implemented at the index facility; similar surveys were then also implemented at those facilities known to be connected most strongly to it as measured by patient transfer data; and prevalence surveys were discontinued after 2 consecutive negative surveys.","1029":"Mask-wearing, even with the use of non-medical masks, has a substantial impact on outbreak control. A judicious implementation of shelter-in-place strategies remains an important public health intervention amid ongoing outbreaks.We extended a previously established agent-based disease transmission model and parameterized it with estimates of COVID-19 characteristics and US population demographics. We implemented non-medical mask-wearing, shelter-in-place, and case isolation as control measures, and quantified their impact on reducing the attack rate and adverse clinical outcomes.A hasty reopening has led to a resurgence of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States (US). We aimed to quantify the impact of several public health measures including non-medical mask-wearing, shelter-in-place, and detection of silent infections to help inform COVID-19 mitigation strategies.We found that non-medical mask-wearing by 75% of the population reduced infections, hospitalizations, and deaths by 37.7% (interquartile range (IQR): 36.1-39.4%), 44.2% (IQR: 42.9-45.8%), and 47.2% (IQR: 45.5-48.7%), respectively, in the absence of a shelter-in-place strategy. Sheltering individuals aged 50 to 64 years of age was the most efficient strategy, decreasing attack rate, hospitalizations, and deaths by over 82% when combined with mask-wearing. Outbreak control was achieved in the simulated scenarios and the attack rate was reduced to below 1% when at least 33% of silent pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infections were identified and isolated.","1030":": Our results indicate that an R0 of less than 1 was highly unlikely unless the size of the initial exposure event was much greater than currently reported. We found that R0 estimates were comparable across scenarios with decreasing event size and increasing duration. Scenarios with a pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval resulted in a higher R0 and were equally plausible to scenarios with SARs-like serial intervals.","1031":"Discovering drugs that efficiently treat brain diseases has been challenging. Genetic variants that modulate the expression of potential drug targets can be utilized to assess the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. We therefore employed Mendelian Randomization (MR) on gene expression measured in brain tissue to identify drug targets involved in neurological and psychiatric diseases. We conducted a two-sample MR using cis-acting brain-derived expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership for Alzheimer's Disease consortium (AMP-AD) and the CommonMind Consortium (CMC) meta-analysis study (n = 1,286) as genetic instruments to predict the effects of 7,137 genes on 12 neurological and psychiatric disorders. We conducted Bayesian colocalization analysis on the top MR findings (using P<6x10-7 as evidence threshold, Bonferroni-corrected for 80,557 MR tests) to confirm sharing of the same causal variants between gene expression and trait in each genomic region. We then intersected the colocalized genes with known monogenic disease genes recorded in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and with genes annotated as drug targets in the Open Targets platform to identify promising drug targets. 80 eQTLs showed MR evidence of a causal effect, from which we prioritised 47 genes based on colocalization with the trait. We causally linked the expression of 23 genes with schizophrenia and a single gene each with anorexia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder within the psychiatric diseases and 9 genes with Alzheimer's disease, 6 genes with Parkinson's disease, 4 genes with multiple sclerosis and two genes with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis within the neurological diseases we tested. From these we identified five genes (ACE, GPNMB, KCNQ5, RERE and SUOX) as attractive drug targets that may warrant follow-up in functional studies and clinical trials, demonstrating the value of this study design for discovering drug targets in neuropsychiatric diseases.","1032":"UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office; Wellcome Trust; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Oxford COVID-19 Research Response Funding; UK National Institute for Health and Care Research; UK Medical Research Council; Public Health England; Liverpool Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre; Research Council of Norway; Vivaldi Invest A\/S; South Eastern Norway Health Authority.Our findings highlight that socio-economic proxies and sex are key predictors of long COVID QALDs and that other (non-clinical) mechanisms drive their observed relationships. Importantly, we outline a multi-method, adaptable causal approach for evaluating the isolated contributions of social disparities to experiences with long COVID.Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, referred to as \"long COVID\", are a globally pervasive threat. While their many clinical determinants are commonly considered, their plausible social correlates are often overlooked.Beyond age, neuropsychological and rheumatological comorbidities, educational attainment, employment status, and female sex were important predictors of long COVID-associated quality of life days (long COVID QALDs). Furthermore, most of their associations could not be attributed to key long COVID-predicting comorbidities. In Norway, 90% (95% CI: 77%, 100%) of the adjusted association between belonging to the top two quintiles of educational attainment and long COVID QALDs was not explained by these clinical intermediates. The same was true for 86% (73%, 100%) and 93% (80%,100%) of the adjusted association between full-time employment and long COVID QALDs in the United Kingdom (UK) and Russia. Additionally, 77% (46%,100%) and 73% (52%, 94%) of the adjusted associations between female sex and long COVID QALDs in Norway and the UK were unexplained by the clinical mediators.Here, we use data from a multinational prospective cohort study to compare social and clinical predictors of differences in quality of life with long COVID. We further measure the extent to which clinical intermediates may explain relationships between social variables and quality of life with long COVID.","1033":"This comparative modeling analysis used 2 established breast cancer microsimulation models from the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) to evaluate different screening strategies. Age-specific breast cancer risks were estimated using aggregated data from the Cancer Risk Estimates Related to Susceptibility (CARRIERS) Consortium for 32\u202f247 cases and 32\u202f544 controls in 12 population-based studies. Data on screening performance for mammography and MRI were estimated from published literature. The models simulated US women with ATM, CHEK2, or PALB2 pathogenic variants born in 1985.Screening mammography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are recommended for women with ATM, CHEK2, and PALB2 pathogenic variants. However, there are few data to guide screening regimens for these women.The mean model-estimated lifetime breast cancer risk was 20.9% (18.1%-23.7%) for women with ATM pathogenic variants, 27.6% (23.4%-31.7%) for women with CHEK2 pathogenic variants, and 39.5% (35.6%-43.3%) for women with PALB2 pathogenic variants. Across pathogenic variants, annual mammography alone from 40 to 74 years was estimated to reduce breast cancer mortality by 36.4% (34.6%-38.2%) to 38.5% (37.8%-39.2%) compared with no screening. Screening with annual MRI starting at 35 years followed by annual mammography and MRI at 40 years was estimated to reduce breast cancer mortality by 54.4% (54.2%-54.7%) to 57.6% (57.2%-58.0%), with 4661 (4635-4688) to 5001 (4979-5023) false-positive screenings and 1280 (1272-1287) to 1368 (1362-1374) benign biopsies per 1000 women. Annual MRI starting at 30 years followed by mammography and MRI at 40 years was estimated to reduce mortality by 55.4% (55.3%-55.4%) to 59.5% (58.5%-60.4%), with 5075 (5057-5093) to 5415 (5393-5437) false-positive screenings and 1439 (1429-1449) to 1528 (1517-1538) benign biopsies per 1000 women. When starting MRI at 30 years, initiating annual mammography starting at 30 vs 40 years did not meaningfully reduce mean mortality rates (0.1% [0.1%-0.2%] to 0.3% [0.2%-0.3%]) but was estimated to add 649 (602-695) to 650 (603-696) false-positive screenings and 58 (41-76) to 59 (41-76) benign biopsies per 1000 women.Screening strategies with combinations of annual mammography alone and with MRI starting at age 25, 30, 35, or 40 years until age 74 years.To estimate the benefits and harms of breast cancer screening strategies using mammography and MRI at various start ages for women with ATM, CHEK2, and PALB2 pathogenic variants.Estimated lifetime breast cancer mortality reduction, life-years gained, breast cancer deaths averted, total screening examinations, false-positive screenings, and benign biopsies per 1000 women screened. Results are reported as model mean values and ranges.This analysis suggests that annual MRI screening starting at 30 to 35 years followed by annual MRI and mammography at 40 years may reduce breast cancer mortality by more than 50% for women with ATM, CHEK2, and PALB2 pathogenic variants. In the setting of MRI screening, mammography prior to 40 years may offer little additional benefit.","1034":"Sepsis is associated with high early and total in-hospital mortality. Despite recent revisions in the diagnostic criteria for sepsis that sought to improve predictive validity for mortality, it remains difficult to identify patients at greatest risk of death. We compared the utility of nine biomarkers to predict mortality in subjects with clinically suspected bacterial sepsis.The medical and surgical ICUs at an academic medical center.Combined biomarkers predict risk for 14-day and total mortality among subjects with suspected sepsis. Serum amyloid P and tissue plasminogen activator demonstrated the best discriminatory ability in this cohort.Fourteen-day mortality was 12.9%, and total in-hospital mortality was 29.5%. Serum amyloid P was significantly lower (4\/4 timepoints) and tissue plasminogen activator significantly higher (3\/4 timepoints) in the 14-day mortality group, and the same pattern held for total in-hospital mortality (Wilcoxon p \u2264 0.046 for all timepoints). Serum amyloid P and tissue plasminogen activator demonstrated the best individual predictive performance for mortality, and combinations of biomarkers including serum amyloid P and tissue plasminogen activator achieved greater predictive performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve > 0.76 for 14-d and 0.74 for total mortality).We enrolled 139 subjects who met two or more systemic inflammatory response syndrome (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) criteria and received new broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy.Cohort study.We assayed nine biomarkers (\u03b1-2 macroglobulin, C-reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen, haptoglobin, procalcitonin, serum amyloid A, serum amyloid P, and tissue plasminogen activator) at onset of suspected sepsis and 24, 48, and 72 hours thereafter. We compared biomarkers between groups based on both 14-day and total in-hospital mortality and evaluated the predictive validity of single and paired biomarkers via area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.","1035":"Echinococcosis is a neglected zoonotic disease affecting over 1 million people worldwide at any given time. It is the leading cause of hospital admissions for parasitic diseases in Chile. We conducted a retrospective investigation of hospitalized cases to describe the epidemiological trends of echinococcosis in Chile. We also examined the potential environmental risk factors for echinococcosis hospitalization rates. Through nation-wide hospital discharge data, a total of 11,516 hospitalized patients with cystic echinococcosis were identified between January 2001 and December 2012. The mean age of hospitalization was 40 years, with notable gender difference in pediatric patients. The hospitalization rate was found to be overall steadily decreasing from 2001 (7.02 per 100,000) to 2012 (4.53 per 100,000) with a 5% decrease per year (rate ratio = 0.95 [95% CI: 0.94, 0.96]). The hospitalization rate was higher in the south of Chile compared to the north. Goat density and intermediate precipitation were found to be significantly positively associated with the hospitalization rate while annual average temperature was found to be significantly negatively associated with the hospitalization rate. Findings of this study indicate that echinococcosis is still an important public health burden in Chile related to interaction with livestock and climate. Efforts should be placed on targeted prevention measures for farmers and raising awareness of echinococcosis among health care workers.","1036":"Information collected in the early phases of an outbreak are important in characterising any novel pathogen. The availability of timely and detailed data and appropriate analyses is critical to estimate and understand a pathogen's transmissibility, high-risk settings for transmission, and key symptoms. These insights can help to inform urgent response strategies.Understanding the characteristics and natural history of novel pathogens is crucial to inform successful control measures. Japan was one of the first affected countries in the COVID-19 pandemic reporting their first case on 14 January 2020. Interventions including airport screening, contact tracing, and cluster investigations were quickly implemented. Here we present insights from the first 3\u00a0months of the epidemic in Japan based on detailed case data. at 1.1 (95% CrI: 1.0, 1.2) compared to 1.5 (95% CrI: 1.3, 1.6), respectively. Household (39.0%) and workplace (11.6%) exposures were the most frequently reported potential source of infection. The estimated probability of transmission was assortative by age with individuals more likely to infect, and be infected by, contacts in a similar age group to them. Across all age groups, cases most frequently onset with cough, fever, and fatigue. There were no reported cases of patients\u2009<\u200920\u00a0years old developing pneumonia or severe respiratory symptoms., correcting for epidemic growth using an established Bayesian framework.

There is scarce literature on treatment delivery modalities that overcome logistical and financial barriers. We utilized different service delivery modalities to provide direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) to PWIDs infected with HCV through methadone clinics and needle and syringe program (NSP) sites in Kenya. In collaboration with Kenya's National AIDS and STI Control Programme (NASCOP), we enrolled individuals with active HCV infection confirmed by HCV RNA detection from methadone and NSP sites in Nairobi, Mombasa, and Kilifi counties. Liver function and hepatitis B virus (HBV) status were assessed at baseline. Those eligible for treatment were offered ledipasvir-sofosbuvir treatment provided by NASCOP through directly observed therapy (DOT). Participants completed a follow-up visit 12\u2009weeks after completing treatment to measure sustained viral response (SVR-12). Challenges faced while delivering HCV treatment at participating sites included the limited availability and reliability of laboratory assays, and financial constraints faced by PWIDs to attend daily DOT. Based on our experience, strategies to deliver HCV treatment for PWID in Kenya should consider improving the availability of laboratory tests and prioritizing treatment through methadone centers to achieve good outcomes.","1038":"With abundance of biological data, computational prediction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from gene expression data has become more feasible. Although incorporating other prior knowledge (PK), along with gene expression data, greatly improves prediction accuracy, the overall accuracy is still low. PK in GRN inference can be categorized into noisy and curated. In noisy PK, relations between genes do not necessarily correspond to regulatory relations and are thus considered inaccurate by inference algorithms such as transcription factor binding and protein-protein interactions. In contrast, curated PK is experimentally verified regulatory interactions in pathway databases. An issue in real data is that gene expression can poorly support the curated PK and thus most existing prediction algorithms cannot use these curated PK. Although several algorithms were proposed to incorporate noisy PK, none address curated PK with poor gene expression support. We present PEAK, a system to integrate both curated and noisy PK in GRN inference, especially with poor gene expression support. We introduce a novel method for GRN inference, CurInf, to effectively integrate curated PK, even when the gene expression data poorly support the PK. PEAK also uses the previously proposed method Modified Elastic Net to incorporate noisy PK, and we call it NoisInf. In our experiment, CurInf significantly incorporates curated PK, which was regarded as noise by previous methods. Using 100% curated PK, CurInf improves the area under precision-recall curve accuracy score over NoisInf by 27.3% in synthetic data, 86.5% in Escherichia coli data, and 31.1% in Saccharomyces cerevisiae data. Moreover, even when the noise in PK is 10 times more than true PK, PEAK performs better than inference without any PK. Better integration of curated PK helps biologists benefit from verified experimental data to predict more reliable GRN.","1039":"Well-child visits focus on health promotion and disease detection and are critical to the appropriate provision of care. Evidence has shown that participation in well-child visits is associated with various patient-level factors; however, there has been an increasing focus on the influence of community-level social determinants of health (SDoH). This study explored associations between well-child visits and community-level SDoH at the census tract level among children enrolled in Alabama Medicaid. Through this analysis, it is possible to understand the distribution of care among this underserved population in different geographic settings, thus identifying potential disparities and areas for targeted intervention. Using administrative data from 2015 to 2017 enrollees in Alabama Medicaid that have been geographically linked to information on urbanicity and poverty, logistic regressions (both in total and stratified by age group) were estimated with separate community-level urbanicity, poverty variables, and individual characteristics. The regressions were repeated using a combined urbanicity\/poverty variable. Looking at urbanicity and poverty together, with the exception of the least urban areas, it was those living in census tracts where there was discordance in urbanicity and poverty that had the highest likelihood of receiving well-child visits compared with those in census tracts classified as medium poverty (all urbanicity levels). There is a positive effect for Medicaid enrollees in the middle tertile of urbanicity in areas of low and high poverty and in wealthier more urban areas. If poverty and urbanicity were explored separately, some of the nuances would not have been apparent.","1040":"Globally, the number of countries with an ODP has grown rapidly since 2013. Nevertheless, disparities in geographical distribution and income levels affect the establishment of ODPs. Furthermore, identified policy gaps in price regulation, incentives that encourage market availability, and incentives that encourage research and development should be addressed to improve access to available and affordable orphan drugs.One hundred seventy-two drug regulation documents and 77 academic publications from 162 countries\/areas were included. Ninety-two of 200 countries\/areas (46.0%) had documentation on ODPs. Thirty-four subthemes from content analysis were categorized into 6 policy themes, namely, orphan drug designation, marketing authorization, safety and efficacy requirements, price regulation, incentives that encourage market availability, and incentives that encourage research and development. Countries\/areas with ODPs were statistically wealthier (gross national income per capita\u00a0= $10\u2009875 vs $3950, P < .001). Country\/area income was also positively correlated with the scope of the respective ODP (correlation coefficient\u00a0= 0.57, P < .001).Pharmaceutical legislation and policies related to access and regulation of orphan drugs were examined from 194 World Health Organization member countries and 6 areas. Orphan drug policies (ODPs) were identified through internet search, emails to national pharmacovigilance centers, and systematic academic literature search. Texts from selected publications were extracted for content analysis.Three hundred million people living with rare diseases worldwide are disproportionately deprived of in-time diagnosis and treatment compared with other patients. This review provides an overview of global policies that optimize development, licensing, pricing, and reimbursement of orphan drugs.","1041":"An effective and widely used vaccine could reduce the burden of dengue virus (DENV) around the world. DENV is endemic in Puerto Rico, where the dengue vaccine CYD-TDV is currently under consideration as a control measure. CYD-TDV has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in vaccinees who had prior dengue virus infection. However, in vaccinees who had no prior dengue virus infection, the vaccine had a modestly elevated risk of hospitalization and severe disease. The WHO therefore recommended a strategy of pre-vaccination screening and vaccination of seropositive persons. To estimate the cost-effectiveness and benefits of this intervention (i.e., screening and vaccination of seropositive persons) in Puerto Rico, we simulated 10 years of the intervention in 9-year-olds using an agent-based model. Across the entire population, we found that 5.5% (4.6%-6.3%) of dengue hospitalizations could be averted. However, we also found that 0.057 (0.045-0.073) additional hospitalizations could occur for every 1,000 people in Puerto Rico due to DENV-na\u00efve children who were vaccinated following a false-positive test results for prior exposure. The ratio of the averted hospitalizations among all vaccinees to additional hospitalizations among DENV-na\u00efve vaccinees was estimated to be 19 (13-24). At a base case cost of vaccination of 382 USD, we found an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 122,000 USD per QALY gained. Our estimates can provide information for considerations to introduce the CYD-TDV vaccine in Puerto Rico.","1042":"Long COVID, or complications arising from COVID-19 weeks after infection, has become a central concern for public health experts. The United States National Institutes of Health founded the RECOVER initiative to better understand long COVID. We used electronic health records available through the National COVID Cohort Collaborative to characterize the association between SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and long COVID diagnosis. Among patients with a COVID-19 infection between August 1, 2021 and January 31, 2022, we defined two cohorts using distinct definitions of long COVID-a clinical diagnosis (n\u2009=\u200947,404) or a previously described computational phenotype (n\u2009=\u2009198,514)-to compare unvaccinated individuals to those with a complete vaccine series prior to infection. Evidence of long COVID was monitored through June or July of 2022, depending on patients' data availability. We found that vaccination was consistently associated with lower odds and rates of long COVID clinical diagnosis and high-confidence computationally derived diagnosis after adjusting for sex, demographics, and medical history.","1043":"Adjoint modeling, using U.S. EPA's Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ), has been performed to provide location-specific monetized health benefits from the controls of primary PM2.5 and PM2.5 precursors (NO x , SO2, and NH3) across North America. Source-to-health benefit relationships are quantified using a benefit-per-ton (BPT) metric, accounting for the impacts on premature mortality due to long-term exposure to fine particulate matter. In the base analysis, the approach used a 12 km resolution, four 2-week episodes chosen to capture annual responses, emissions for 2016, and the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM) to link exposures to premature mortality. Here, we investigate the impacts those choices have on results using a range of sensitivity analyses. The choice of four representative episodes led to relatively little bias and error. Finer model resolution, investigated by comparing 36, 12, 4, and 1 km simulations over two urban areas, tended to increase BPT estimates, though the impact was inconsistent between different regions. While BPTs and burden estimates were consistent across resolutions over New York City, they sharply increased for Los Angeles, particularly for NOx and ammonia, leading to 90% increase in burden estimates at 1 km resolution. We find that, for primary PM2.5 emissions, better resolved population distribution is the main contributing factor to higher BPTs, but for secondary precursor emissions (ammonia and NOx), higher model resolution that avoids dilution in coarser grids is more important. Changing emissions from 2016 to 2001 and 2028 resulted in fairly consistent primary PM2.5 BPTs but impacted the BPTs for NOx and ammonia more significantly due to changes in SO2 emissions. We found that BPTs tend to stabilize, as emission changes in 2028 lead to a lower deviation from 2016 BPTs compared to changes from the 2001 episode. The role of the epidemiological model also led to relatively modest uncertainties, 15-30% depending on the species, even when different shapes of concentration-response functions were employed. We found the impact of the choice of CRF to be larger or comparable in size to the reported epidemiological model uncertainties for log-linear CRFs. The adjoining approach proved robust to modeling choices in providing BPT estimates that are highly granular across locations and emitted species.","1044":"Model comparisons have been widely used to guide intervention strategies to control infectious diseases. Agreement between different models is crucial for providing robust evidence for policy-makers because differences in model properties can influence their predictions. In this study, we compared models implemented by two individual-based model simulators for HIV epidemiology in a heterosexual population with Herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2). For each model simulator, we constructed four models, starting from a simplified basic model and stepwise including more model complexity. For the resulting eight models, the predictions of the impact of behavioural interventions on the HIV epidemic in Yaound\u00e9-Cameroon were compared. The results show that differences in model assumptions and model complexity can influence the size of the predicted impact of the intervention, as well as the predicted qualitative behaviour of the HIV epidemic after the intervention. These differences in predictions of an intervention were also observed for two models that agreed in their predictions of the HIV epidemic in the absence of that intervention. Without additional data, it is impossible to determine which of these two models is the most reliable. These findings highlight the importance of making more data available for the calibration and validation of epidemiological models.","1045":"The model estimated the 10-year cumulative probability of reclassification from a Gleason score of 6 to a Gleason score\u2009\u2265\u20097 to be 40.0%. The probability of undersampling at diagnosis was 9.8%, and the annual progression probability for men with a Gleason score of 6 was 4.0%. On the basis of these estimates, a simulation of an annual biopsy strategy estimated the mean time to the detection of disease with a Gleason score\u2009\u2265\u20097 to be 14.1 months; however, several strategies eliminated biopsies with only small delays (<12 months) in detecting grade progression.With data from 1375 men with low-risk prostate cancer enrolled in AS at Johns Hopkins, a hidden Markov model was developed to estimate the probability of undersampling at diagnosis, the annual probability of grade progression, and the 10-year cumulative probability of reclassification or progression to Gleason score\u2009\u2265\u20097. It simulated 1024 potential AS biopsy strategies for the 10 years after diagnosis. For each of these strategies, the model predicted the mean delay in the detection of disease with a Gleason score\u2009\u2265\u20097.Although annual biopsy for low-risk men on AS is associated with the shortest time to the detection of disease with a Gleason score\u2009\u2265\u20097, several alternative strategies may allow less frequent biopsying without sizable delays in detecting grade progression. Cancer 2018;124:698-705. \u00a9 2017 American Cancer Society.Active surveillance (AS) for prostate cancer includes follow-up with serial prostate biopsies. The optimal biopsy frequency during follow-up has not been determined. The goal of this investigation was to use longitudinal AS biopsy data to assess whether the frequency of biopsy could be reduced without substantially prolonging the time to the detection of disease with a Gleason score\u2009\u2265\u20097.","1046":"Complex systems are often characterized by distinct types of interactions between the same entities. These can be described as a multilayer network where each layer represents one type of interaction. These layers may be interdependent in complicated ways, revealing different kinds of structure in the network. In this work we present a generative model, and an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm, which allows us to perform inference tasks such as community detection and link prediction in this setting. Our model assumes overlapping communities that are common between the layers, while allowing these communities to affect each layer in a different way, including arbitrary mixtures of assortative, disassortative, or directed structure. It also gives us a mathematically principled way to define the interdependence between layers, by measuring how much information about one layer helps us predict links in another layer. In particular, this allows us to bundle layers together to compress redundant information and identify small groups of layers which suffice to predict the remaining layers accurately. We illustrate these findings by analyzing synthetic data and two real multilayer networks, one representing social support relationships among villagers in South India and the other representing shared genetic substring material between genes of the malaria parasite.","1047":"We consider the dynamics of a mosquito-transmitted pathogen in a multi-patch Ross-Macdonald malaria model with mobile human hosts, mobile vectors, and a heterogeneous environment. We show the existence of a globally stable steady state, and a threshold that determines whether a pathogen is either absent from all patches, or endemic and present at some level in all patches. Each patch is characterized by a local basic reproduction number, whose value predicts whether the disease is cleared or not when the patch is isolated: patches are known as \"demographic sinks\" if they have a local basic reproduction number less than one, and hence would clear the disease if isolated; patches with a basic reproduction number above one would sustain endemic infection in isolation, and become \"demographic sources\" of parasites when connected to other patches. Sources are also considered focal areas of transmission for the larger landscape, as they export excess parasites to other areas and can sustain parasite populations. We show how to determine the various basic reproduction numbers from steady state estimates in the patched network and knowledge of additional model parameters, hereby identifying parasite sources in the process. This is useful in the context of control of the infection on natural landscapes, because a commonly suggested strategy is to target focal areas, in order to make their corresponding basic reproduction numbers less than one, effectively turning them into sinks. We show that this is indeed a successful control strategy-albeit a conservative and possibly expensive one-in case either the human host, or the vector does not move. However, we also show that when both humans and vectors move, this strategy may fail, depending on the specific movement patterns exhibited by hosts and vectors.","1048":"Ants and other insects are often a source of localized secondary dispersal for wind-dispersed plants and thus play an important ecological role in their spatial dynamics, but there is limited information on how climate change will affect such dispersal processes. Here, we use field experiments to investigate how climate warming affects seed removal, as this initiation of movement represents the first step in insect-driven secondary dispersal. Our results indicate that for the invasive thistles Carduus nutans and Carduus acanthoides, increased growing temperature influences seed attractiveness to insect dispersers, with seeds from maternal plants grown at temperatures 0.6\u00b0C above ambient removed by insect dispersers at higher rates than their unwarmed counterparts. We also observe that seed elaiosomes in these two species play an important role in dispersal, as seeds without elaiosomes were significantly less likely to be removed over the same time period. Significant interactions between elaiosome presence\/absence and warming treatment were also observed, though only for C. acanthoides, with the boost in seed removal from warming dampened when the elaiosome was present compared to when it was absent. These findings provide evidence that climate warming may alter aspects of dispersal such as seed removal by secondary dispersers, with potential ramifications for dispersal in future climates since seed-bearing plants around the world may be subject to increased growing temperatures, and many of these plant species bear elaiosomes and experience seed dispersal by insects.","1049":"Malawi experienced its deadliest Vibrio cholerae (Vc) outbreak following devastating cyclones, with >58,000 cases and >1700 deaths reported between March 2022 and May 2023. Here, we use population genomics to investigate the attributes and origin of the Malawi 2022-2023 Vc outbreak isolates. Our results demonstrate the predominance of ST69 clone, also known as the seventh cholera pandemic El Tor (7PET) lineage, expressing O1 Ogawa (~\u200980%) serotype followed by Inaba (~\u200916%) and sporadic non-O1\/non-7PET serogroups (~\u20094%). Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed that the Malawi outbreak strains correspond to a recent importation from Asia into Africa (sublineage AFR15). These isolates harboured known antimicrobial resistance and virulence elements, notably the ICEGEN\/ICEVchHai1\/ICEVchind5 SXT\/R391-like integrative conjugative elements and a CTX\u03c6 prophage with the ctxB7 genotype compared to historical Malawian Vc isolates. These data suggest that the devastating cyclones coupled with the recent importation of 7PET serogroup O1 strains, may explain the magnitude of the 2022-2023 cholera outbreak in Malawi.","1050":"Adolescents\/young adults previously followed as children aged under 5 years were interviewed. Childhood data were available on diarrhea, pneumonia, and parental\/household characteristics. New data were collected on health, anthropometry, education, employment, and languages spoken; nonverbal reasoning was assessed. A multivariable Bayesian network was constructed to explore structural relationships between variables. Of 1,868 children originally enrolled, 1,463 (78.3%) were interviewed as adolescents (range 16.0-29.3 years, mean age 22.6 years); 945 (65%) lived in Oshikhandass. While 1,031 (70.5%) of their mothers and 440 (30.1%) of their fathers had received no formal education, adolescents reported a mean of 11.1 years of education. Childhood diarrhea (calculated as episodes\/child-year) had no association with nonverbal reasoning score (an arc was supported in just 4.6% of bootstrap samples), health measures (with BMI, 1% of bootstrap samples; systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 0.1% and 1.6% of bootstrap samples, respectively), education (0.7% of bootstrap samples), or employment (0% of bootstrap samples). Relationships were found between nonverbal reasoning and adolescent height (arc supported in 63% of bootstrap samples), age (84%), educational attainment (100%), and speaking English (100%); speaking English was linked to the childhood home environment, mediated through maternal education and primary language. Speaking English (n = 390, 26.7% of adolescents) was associated with education (100% of bootstrap samples), self-reported child health (82%), current location (85%) and variables describing childhood socioeconomic status. The main limitations of this study were the lack of parental data to characterize the home setting (including parental mental and physical health, and female empowerment) and reliance on self-reporting of health status.In this population, investments in education, especially for females, are associated with an increase in human capital. Against the backdrop of substantial societal change, with the exception of a small and indirect association between childhood malnutrition and cognitive scores, educational opportunities and cultural language groups have stronger associations with aspects of human capital than childhood morbidity.Adolescence is a critical point in the realization of human capital, as health and educational decisions with long-term impacts are made. We examined the role of early childhood experiences on health, cognitive abilities, and educational outcomes of adolescents followed up from a longitudinal cohort study in Pakistan, hypothesizing that early childhood experiences reflecting poverty would manifest in reduced health and development in adolescence.","1051":"in total 3,989 participants were included in the analysis, mean age 61\u00a0years (standard deviation 13); 2,175 (54.5%) were women. The median frailty index was 0.13 (interquartile range 0.09-0.19); Using population-specific cutoffs, 557 (14.0%) had moderate frailty and 263 (6.6%) had severe frailty. All-cause mortality risk was related to frailty severity independent of age and sex (hazard ratio per 0.01 increase in frailty index: 1.06 [95% confidence interval 1.04-1.07]). The frailty index alone showed moderate discrimination for one-year mortality: c-statistic 0.68-0.76; combining the frailty index with age and sex improved performance (c-statistic 0.77-0.81).analysis of cross-sectional data from the Health and Ageing in Africa: Longitudinal Studies of an INDEPTH Community (HAALSI) study. We used self-reported diagnoses, symptoms, activities of daily living, objective physiological indices and blood tests to calculate a 32-variable cumulative deficit frailty index. We fitted Cox proportional hazards models to test associations between frailty category and all-cause mortality. We tested the discriminant ability of the frailty index to predict one-year mortality alone and in addition to age and sex.frailty measured by cumulative deficits is common and predicts mortality in a rural population of older South Africans. The number of measures needed may limit utility in resource-poor settings.despite rapid population ageing, few studies have investigated frailty in older people in sub-Saharan Africa. We tested a cumulative deficit frailty index in a population of older people from rural South Africa.","1052":"Healthcare workers' mental health was affected by SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.An online self-reported questionnaire was designed including the Goldberg Health Questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire, (PHQ-9), and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale among other questions. It was sent to 28,038 healthcare workers.There is a high percentage of health workers with symptoms of psychological distress, depression, and suicidal ideas. The gender approach is essential to understand the important differences found. Many health workers who required mental health care did not seek or received it.The questionnaire was answered by 1,934 participants, with a median age of 38 years (74% women). Seventy five percent were professionals, and 48% worked at a hospital. Fifty nine percent of respondents had a risk of having a mental health disorder, and 73% had depressive symptoms. Significant associations were found with sex, workplace, and some of the relevant experiences during the pandemic. Fifty one percent reported the need for mental health support, and 38% of them received it.To evaluate healthcare workers' mental health and its associated factors during the pandemic in Chile.","1053":"By combining well-established population genetic theory with high-throughput sequencing data from natural populations, major strides have recently been made in understanding how, why, and when vertebrate populations evolve crypsis. Here, we focus on background matching, a particular facet of crypsis that involves the ability of an organism to conceal itself through matching its color to the surrounding environment. While interesting in and of itself, the study of this phenotype has also provided fruitful population genetic insights into the interplay of strong positive selection with other evolutionary processes. Specifically, and predicated upon the findings of previous candidate gene association studies, a primary focus of this recent literature involves the realization that the inference of selection from DNA sequence data first requires a robust model of population demography in order to identify genomic regions which do not conform to neutral expectations. Moreover, these demographic estimates provide crucial information about the origin and timing of the onset of selective pressures associated with, for example, the colonization of a novel environment. Furthermore, such inference has revealed crypsis to be a particularly useful phenotype for investigating the interplay of migration and selection-with examples of gene flow constraining rates of adaptation, or alternatively providing the genetic variants that may ultimately sweep through the population. Here, we evaluate the underlying evidence, review the strengths and weaknesses of the many population genetic methodologies used in these studies, and discuss how these insights have aided our general understanding of the evolutionary process.","1054":"We analyzed 4,843 sera from 2,097 unvaccinated participants in the study, collected from April 2009 to December 2010. After accounting for nonbracketing, we estimated that the cumulative incidence of H1N1pdm09 virus infection was 45% (95% credible interval [CI] = 40%, 49%), 17% (95% CI = 13%, 20%), and 11% (95% CI = 6%, 18%) for children ages 0-18 years, adults 19-50 years, and older adults >50 years, respectively. Including all available data substantially increased precision compared with a simpler analysis based only on sera collected at 6-month intervals in a subset of participants.In influenza epidemiology, analysis of paired sera collected from people before and after influenza seasons has been used for decades to study the cumulative incidence of influenza virus infections in populations. However, interpretation becomes challenging when sera are collected after the start or before the end of an epidemic, and do not neatly bracket the epidemic.We developed a framework for the analysis of antibody titers that accounted for the timing of sera collection with respect to influenza activity and permitted robust estimation of the cumulative incidence of infection during an epidemic.Serum samples were collected longitudinally in a community-based study. Most participants provided their first serum after the start of circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in 2009. We developed a Bayesian hierarchical model to correct for nonbracketing sera and estimate the cumulative incidence of infection from the serological data and surveillance data in Hong Kong.","1055":"We used data from the Connecticut State Inpatient Database to identify RSV hospitalizations based on ICD-9 diagnostic codes. Harmonic regression analyses were used to evaluate RSV epidemic timing at the county level and ZIP code levels. Linear regression was used to investigate associations between the socioeconomic status of a locality and RSV epidemic timing.9,740 hospitalizations coded as RSV occurred among children less than 2 years old between July 1, 1997 and June 30, 2013. The earliest ZIP code had a seasonal RSV epidemic that peaked, on average, 4.64 weeks earlier than the latest ZIP code. Earlier epidemic timing was significantly associated with demographic characteristics (higher population density and larger fraction of the population that was black).Seasonal RSV epidemics in Connecticut occurred earlier in areas that were more urban (higher population density and larger fraction of the population that was). These findings could be used to better time the administration of prophylaxis to high-risk infants.Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a primary cause of hospitalizations in children worldwide. The timing of seasonal RSV epidemics needs to be known in order to administer prophylaxis to high-risk infants at the appropriate time.","1056":"We previously used mathematical modeling to predict reduced malaria incidence in children with protease inhibitor (PI)-, compared with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-, based highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), in moderate to high malaria transmission areas. These effects were accounted for, in part, by pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions between PIs and artemether-lumefantrine (AL).Because of potentially reduced malaria transmission reservoirs in HIV-infected children due to PI\/AL PK interactions impacting non-HIV-infected children, we estimate the antimalarial benefit of PI-based HAART in all children, and in HIV-infected children only residing in low to moderate malaria transmission areas.Comparing situations of low to high HIV newborn prevalence, and low to moderate malaria transmission intensities, our model predicts the combination of PI-based HAART with AL-treated malaria prevents 0.04-24.8 and 0.05-34.5 annual incidences of malaria overall per 1000 children, and saves 0.003-1.66 and 0.003-2.30 disability-adjusted life years per 1000 children, respectively. When incorporating seasonality, 0.01-7.3 and 0.01-5.9 annual incidences of malaria overall per 1000 children, and 0.0-0.5 and 0.001-0.41 disability-adjusted life years per 100 children, are prevented, respectively.To evaluate the benefit of HIV PI-based HAART on malaria incidence, a malaria transmission model with varying degrees of HIV newborn prevalence was developed using recent pediatric clinical trial data in Lilongwe, Malawi.A dynamic model of malaria transmission was developed to evaluate the PK interaction of PI-based HAART with the antimalarial, AL for preventing malaria.In low to moderate malaria transmission intensity areas, PI-based HAART may reduce malaria events in children when AL is used.","1057":"Vaccination programmes to prevent outbreaks after introductions of infectious people aim to maintain the average number of secondary infections per infectious person at one or less. We aimed to assess heterogeneity in vaccine uptake and other characteristics that, together with non-random mixing, could increase this number and to evaluate strategies that could mitigate their impact.None.In 2008, 39\u2008132 children began elementary school in San Diego County, CA, USA. At entry to school, 97% had received at least one dose of the MMR vaccine, with 2\u00b75% having personal-belief exemptions. We note substantial heterogeneity in immunity throughout the county. Although the average population immunities for measles, mumps, and rubella (92%, 87%, 92%) were similar to the population-immunity thresholds in homogeneous, randomly-mixing populations (91%, 88%, 76%), after accounting for heterogeneity and non-random mixing, the basic reproduction numbers increased by 70%, meaning that introduced pathogens could cause outbreaks. The impact of our modelled interventions ranged from negligible to a nearly complete reduction in the outbreak potential of measles. The most effective intervention to lower the realised reproduction number (RV 3\u00b739) was raising immunity by 50% in 114 schools with low immunity (RV 1\u00b702), but raising immunity by this level in only influential, low-immunity schools also was effective (RV 2\u00b702). The effectiveness of vaccinating the 972 children with personal-belief exemptions was similar to that of targeting all low-immunity schools (RV 1\u00b711). Targeting only private schools had little effect.Because most US children attend elementary school in their own neighbourhoods, surveys of children entering elementary school (age 5 years before Sept 1) allow assessment of spatial heterogeneity in the proportion of children immune to vaccine-preventable diseases. We used data from a 2008 school-entry survey by the Immunization Division of the California Department of Public Health to obtain school addresses; numbers of students enrolled; proportions of enrolled students who had received one or two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine; and proportions with medical or personal-belief exemptions. Using a mixing model suitable for spatially-stratified populations, we projected the expected numbers of secondary infections per infectious person for measles, mumps, and rubella. We also mapped contributions to this number for measles in San Diego County's 638 elementary schools and its largest district, comprising 200 schools (31%). We then modelled the effect on measles' realised reproduction number (RV) of the following plausible interventions: vaccinating all children with personal-belief exemptions, increasing uptake by 10% to 50% in all low-immunity schools (3 or contacts inter-school >30%) low-immunity schools, and increasing private school uptake to the public school average.Our findings suggest that increasing vaccine uptake could prevent outbreaks such as that of measles in San Diego in 2008. Vaccinating children with personal-belief exemptions was one of the most effective interventions that we modelled, but further research on mixing in heterogeneous populations is needed.","1058":"In this study, we evaluated the impact of viral variant, in addition to other variables, on within-host viral burden, by analysing cycle threshold (Ct) values derived from nose and throat swabs, collected as part of the UK COVID-19 Infection Survey. Because viral burden distributions determined from community survey data can be biased due to the impact of variant epidemiology on the time-since-infection of samples, we developed a method to explicitly adjust observed Ct value distributions to account for the expected bias. By analysing the adjusted Ct values using partial least squares regression, we found that among unvaccinated individuals with no known prior exposure, viral burden was 44% lower among Alpha variant infections, compared to those with the predecessor strain, B.1.177. Vaccination reduced viral burden by 67%, and among vaccinated individuals, viral burden was 286% higher among Delta variant, compared to Alpha variant, infections. In addition, viral burden increased by 17% for every 10-year age increment of the infected individual. In summary, within-host viral burden increases with age, is reduced by vaccination, and is influenced by the interplay of vaccination status and viral variant.","1059":"We estimated a peak vaccine effectiveness between 2 weeks and 3 months following receipt of the second dose, with 85% and 90% effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, respectively. However, in line with previous findings for adults, waning of vaccine effectiveness was evident in adolescents as well. Long-term protection conferred by the vaccine was reduced to 75-78% against infection and symptomatic infection, respectively, 3 to 5 months after the second dose, and waned to 58% against infection and 65% against COVID-19 after 5 months.Leveraging the centralized computerized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), we conducted a matched case-control design for evaluating the association between time since vaccination and the incidence of infections, where two outcomes were evaluated separately: a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection (regardless of symptoms) and a symptomatic infection (COVID-19). Cases were defined as individuals aged 12 to 16 with a positive PCR test occurring between June 15 and December 8, 2021, when the Delta variant was dominant in Israel. Controls were adolescents who had not tested positive previously.The short-term effectiveness of a two-dose regimen of the BioNTech\/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine for adolescents has been demonstrated. However, little is known about the long-term effectiveness in this age group. It is known, though, that waning of vaccine-induced immunity against infection in adult populations is evident within a few months.Like adults, vaccine-induced protection against both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 wanes with time, starting three months after inoculation and continuing for more than five months.","1060":"In the omics era, saliva, a filtrate of blood, may serve as an alternative, noninvasive biospecimen to blood, although its use for specific metabolomic applications has not been fully evaluated. We demonstrated that the saliva metabolome may provide sensitive measures of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) and associated biological responses via high-resolution, longitudinal metabolomics profiling. We collected 167 pairs of saliva and plasma samples from a cohort of 53 college student participants and measured corresponding indoor and outdoor concentrations of six air pollutants for the dormitories where the students lived. Grand correlation between common metabolic features in saliva and plasma was moderate to high, indicating a relatively consistent association between saliva and blood metabolites across subjects. Although saliva was less associated with TRAP compared to plasma, 25 biological pathways associated with TRAP were detected via saliva and accounted for 69% of those detected via plasma. Given the slightly higher feature reproducibility found in saliva, these findings provide some indication that the saliva metabolome offers a sensitive and practical alternative to blood for characterizing individual biological responses to environmental exposures.","1061":"None.Reduced rates of antibiotic consumption alone will not be sufficient to combat the rising worldwide prevalence of AMR. Control methods should focus on poverty reduction and aim to prevent AMR transmission across different One Health domains while accounting for domain-specific risk factors. The levelling up of livestock surveillance systems to better match those reporting on human AMR, and, strengthening all surveillance efforts, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries, are pressing priorities.Significant associations were identified between animal antimicrobial consumption and AMR in food-producing animals (OR 1\u00b705 [95% CI 1\u00b701-1\u00b710]; p=0\u00b7013), and between human antimicrobial consumption and AMR specifically in WHO critical priority (1\u00b706 [1\u00b700-1\u00b712]; p=0\u00b7035) and high priority (1\u00b722 [1\u00b709-1\u00b737]; p<0\u00b70001) pathogens. Bidirectional associations were also found: animal antibiotic consumption was positively linked with resistance in critical priority human pathogens (1\u00b707 [1\u00b701-1\u00b713]; p=0\u00b7020) and human antibiotic consumption was positively linked with animal AMR (1\u00b705 [1\u00b701-1\u00b709]; p=0\u00b7010). Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumanii, third generation cephalosporins-resistant Escherichia coli, and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus all had significant associations with animal antibiotic consumption. Analyses also suggested significant roles of socioeconomics, including governance on AMR rates in humans and animals.Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a pressing, holistic, and multisectoral challenge facing contemporary global health. In this study we assessed the associations between socioeconomic, anthropogenic, and environmental indicators and country-level rates of AMR in humans and food-producing animals.In this modelling study, we obtained data on Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumanii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, third generation cephalosporins-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium AMR in humans and food-producing animals from publicly available sources, including WHO, World Bank, and Center for Disease Dynamics Economics and Policy. AMR in food-producing animals presented a combined prevalence of AMR exposure in cattle, pigs, and chickens. We used multivariable \u03b2 regression models to determine the adjusted association between human and food-producing animal AMR rates and an array of ecological country-level indicators. Human AMR rates were classified according to the WHO priority pathogens list and antibiotic-bacterium pairs.","1062":"Hepatitis C (HCV) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease and mortality worldwide and persons who inject drugs (PWID) are at the highest risk for acquiring and transmitting HCV infection. We developed an agent-based model (ABM) to identify and optimize direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy scale-up and treatment strategies for achieving the World Health Organization (WHO) goals of HCV elimination by the year 2030. While DAA is highly efficacious, it is also expensive, and therefore intervention strategies should balance the goals of elimination and the cost of the intervention. Here we present and compare two methods for finding PWID treatment enrollment strategies by conducting a standard model parameter sweep and compare the results to an evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm. The evolutionary approach provides a pareto-optimal set of solutions that minimizes treatment costs and incidence rates.","1063":"Understanding variation of traits within and among species through time and across space is central to many questions in biology. Many resources assemble species-level trait data, but the data and metadata underlying those trait measurements are often not reported. Here, we introduce FuTRES (Functional Trait Resource for Environmental Studies; pronounced few-tress), an online datastore and community resource for individual-level trait reporting that utilizes a semantic framework. FuTRES already stores millions of trait measurements for paleobiological, zooarchaeological, and modern specimens, with a current focus on mammals. We compare dynamically derived extant mammal species' body size measurements in FuTRES with summary values from other compilations, highlighting potential issues with simply reporting a single mean estimate. We then show that individual-level data improve estimates of body mass-including uncertainty-for zooarchaeological specimens. FuTRES facilitates trait data integration and discoverability, accelerating new research agendas, especially scaling from intra- to interspecific trait variability.","1064":"A cyclical pattern of dengue cases was observed with annual peaks coinciding with the intermonsoon period. Our analysis reveals that maximum temperature, mean temperature, rainfall, and wind speed have a significant nonlinear effect on dengue cases in Kelantan. Our model can explain approximately 8.2% of dengue incidence variabilities.Weather variables affect nearly 10% of the dengue incidences in Northeast Malaysia, thereby making it a relevant variable to be included in a dengue early warning system. Interventions such as vector control activities targeting the intermonsoon period are recommended.Dengue, a vector-borne viral illness, shows worldwide widening spatial distribution beyond its point of origination, namely, the tropical belt. The persistent hyperendemicity in Malaysia has resulted in the formation of the dengue early warning system. However, weather variables are yet to be fully utilized for prevention and control activities, particularly in east-coast peninsular Malaysia where limited studies have been conducted. We aim to provide a time-based estimate of possible dengue incidence increase following weather-related changes, thereby highlighting potential dengue outbreaks.All serologically confirmed dengue patients in Kelantan, a northeastern state in Malaysia, registered in the eDengue system with an onset of disease from January 2016 to December 2018, were included in the study with the exclusion of duplicate entry. Using a generalized additive model, climate data collected from the Kota Bharu weather station (latitude 6\u00b010'N, longitude 102\u00b018'E) was analysed with dengue data.","1065":"Mass vaccinations are crucial public health interventions\u00a0for curbing infectious diseases. Canine rabies control relies on mass dog vaccination campaigns (MDVCs) that are held annually across the globe. Dog owners must bring their pets to fixed vaccination sites, but sometimes target coverage is not achieved due to low participation. Travel distance to vaccination sites is an important barrier to participation.\u00a0We aimed to increase MDVC participation\u00a0in silico\u00a0by optimally placing fixed-point vaccination locations. We quantified participation probability based on walking distance to the nearest vaccination site using regression models fit to participation data collected\u00a0over\u00a04 years. We used computational recursive interchange techniques to optimally place fixed-point vaccination sites and compared predicted participation with these optimally placed vaccination sites to actual locations used in previous campaigns. Algorithms that minimized average walking distance or maximized expected participation provided the best solutions. Optimal vaccination placement is expected to increase participation by 7% and improve spatial evenness of coverage, resulting in fewer under-vaccinated pockets. However, unevenness in workload across sites remained. Our data-driven algorithm optimally places limited resources to increase overall vaccination participation and equity. Field evaluations are essential to assess effectiveness and evaluate\u00a0potentially\u00a0longer waiting queues\u00a0resulting from\u00a0increased participation.","1066":"Mozambique is making progress towards elimination of trachoma as a public health problem, but in some districts trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) prevalence remains above the 5% elimination threshold despite years of various interventions, including antibiotic mass drug administration. To characterize transmission in four districts, we incorporated testing of ocular infection and serology into routine trachoma impact surveys (TIS) in August 2022. We examined residents aged \u2265\u20091 year for trachoma and collected information on household water, sanitation, and hygiene. Among children aged 1-9 years, we tested conjunctival swabs for Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic acid and dried blood spots for C. trachomatis antibodies. We modeled age-dependent seroprevalence to estimate seroconversion rate (SCR). We examined 4841 children aged 1-9 years. TF prevalence ranged between 1.1 and 6.0% with three districts below the 5% threshold. PCR-confirmed infection prevalence ranged between 1.1 and 4.8%, and Pgp3 seroprevalence ranged between 8.8 and 24.3%. Pgp3 SCR was 1.9 per 100 children per year in the district with the lowest TF prevalence. Two other districts with TF\u2009<\u20095% had SCR of 5.0 and 4.7. The district with TF\u2009\u2265\u20095% had a SCR of 6.0. This enhanced TIS furthered understanding of transmission in these districts and provides information on additional indicators for monitoring trachoma programs.","1067":" copies per mL per day) than did unvaccinated individuals with pre-alpha (0\u00b769), alpha (0\u00b782), or delta (0\u00b779) variant infections. Within individuals, faster viral load growth was correlated with higher peak viral load (correlation 0\u00b742 [95% credible interval 0\u00b713 to 0\u00b765]) and slower decline (-0\u00b744 [-0\u00b767 to -0\u00b718]).Vaccination reduces the risk of delta variant infection and accelerates viral clearance. Nonetheless, fully vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections have peak viral load similar to unvaccinated cases and can efficiently transmit infection in household settings, including to fully vaccinated contacts. Host-virus interactions early in infection may shape the entire viral trajectory.National Institute for Health Research.The SARS-CoV-2 delta (B.1.617.2) variant is highly transmissible and spreading globally, including in populations with high vaccination rates. We aimed to investigate transmission and viral load kinetics in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals with mild delta variant infection in the community.Between Sept 13, 2020, and Sept 15, 2021, 602 community contacts (identified via the UK contract-tracing system) of 471 UK COVID-19 index cases were recruited to the Assessment of Transmission and Contagiousness of COVID-19 in Contacts cohort study and contributed 8145 upper respiratory tract samples from daily sampling for up to 20 days. Household and non-household exposed contacts aged 5 years or older were eligible for recruitment if they could provide informed consent and agree to self-swabbing of the upper respiratory tract. We analysed transmission risk by vaccination status for 231 contacts exposed to 162 epidemiologically linked delta variant-infected index cases. We compared viral load trajectories from fully vaccinated individuals with delta infection (n=29) with unvaccinated individuals with delta (n=16), alpha (B.1.1.7; n=39), and pre-alpha (n=49) infections. Primary outcomes for the epidemiological analysis were to assess the secondary attack rate (SAR) in household contacts stratified by contact vaccination status and the index cases' vaccination status. Primary outcomes for the viral load kinetics analysis were to detect differences in the peak viral load, viral growth rate, and viral decline rate between participants according to SARS-CoV-2 variant and vaccination status.","1068":"Measles and rubella micro-array patches (MR-MAPs) are a promising innovation to address limitations of the current needle and syringe (N&S) presentation due to their single-dose presentation, ease of use, and improved thermostability. To direct and accelerate further research and interventions, an initial full value vaccine assessment (iFVVA) was initiated prior to MR-MAPs entering phase I trials to quantify their value and identify key data gaps and challenges. The iFVVA utilized a mixed-methods approach with rapid assessment of literature, stakeholder interviews and surveys, and quantitative data analyses to (i) assess global need for improved MR vaccines and how MR-MAPs could address MR problem statements; (ii) estimate costs and benefits of MR-MAPs; (iii) identify the best pathway from development to delivery; and (iv) identify outstanding areas of need where stakeholder intervention can be helpful. These analyses found that if MR-MAPs are broadly deployed, they can potentially reach an additional 80 million children compared to the N&S presentation between 2030-2040. MR-MAPs can avert up to 37 million measles cases, 400,000 measles deaths, and 26 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). MR-MAPs with the most optimal product characteristics of low price, controlled temperature chain (CTC) properties, and small cold chain volumes were shown to be cost saving for routine immunization (RI) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) compared to N&S. Uncertainties about price and future vaccine coverage impact the potential cost-effectiveness of introducing MR-MAPs in LMICs, indicating that it could be cost-effective in 16-81% of LMICs. Furthermore, this iFVVA highlighted the importance of upfront donor investment in manufacturing set-up and clinical studies and the critical influence of an appropriate price to ensure country and manufacturer financial sustainability. To ensure that MR-MAPs achieve the greatest public health benefit, MAP developers, vaccine manufacturers, donors, financiers, and policy- and decision-makers will need close collaboration and open communications.","1069":"Our findings could facilitate the development of interventions for personalized prevention and treatment of DHRs, as well as future pharmacogenetic investigations of MRGPRX2 in relevant disease cohorts.Allergic drug reaction or drug allergy is an immunologically mediated drug hypersensitivity reaction (DHR). G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are common drug targets and communicate extracellular signals that initiate cellular responses. Recent evidence shows that GPCR MRGPRX2 is of major importance in IgE-independent pseudo-allergic DHRs based on the suspected interactions between many FDA-approved peptidergic compounds and MRGPRX2.Our aim was to uncover novel MRGPRX2-selective and -potent agonists as drug candidates responsible for clinical features of pseudo-allergic DHRs.The alternative allele of single nucleotide polymorphism rs10833049 (N62S) in MRGPRX2 demonstrated loss-of-function property in response to substance P and antineoplastic agent daunorubicin hydrochloride. We applied a unique assay system targeting the N62S mutation to the HTS and identified 84 MRGPRX2-selective active hit compounds representing diverse classes according to primary drug indications. The top five highly represented groups included fluoroquinolone and non-fluoroquinolone antibiotics; antidepressive\/antipsychotic; antihistaminic and antineoplastic agents. We classified hit compounds into 14 clusters representing a variety of chemical and drug classes beyond those reported, such as opioids, neuromuscular blocking agents, and fluoroquinolones. We further demonstrated MRGPRX2-dependent degranulation in the human mast cell line LAD2 cells induced by three novel agonists representing the non-fluoroquinolone antibiotics (bacitracin A), anti-allergic agents (brompheniramine maleate) and tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (imatinib mesylate).We conducted a primary high-throughput screening (HTS), coupled with mutagenesis targeting the MRGPRX2 N62S mutation, on a panel of 3,456 library compounds. We discovered pharmacologically active hit compounds as agonists of the MRGPRX2 protein according to high degrees of potency evaluated by the calcium response and validated by the degranulation assay. Using the molecular tool Forge, we also characterized the structure-activity relationship shared by identified hit compounds.","1070":"The EU, the USA, and Japan account for the majority of biological pharmacotherapy use worldwide. Biosimilar regulatory approval pathways were authorised in the EU (2006), in Japan (2009), and in the USA (2015), to facilitate approval of biological drugs that are highly similar to reference products and to encourage market competition. Between 2007 and 2020, 33 biosimilars for oncology were approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), 16 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and ten by the Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). Some of these approved applications were initially rejected because of manufacturing concerns (four of 36 [11%] with the EMA, seven of 16 [44%] with the FDA, none of ten for the PMDA). Median times from initial regulatory submission before approval of oncology biosimilars were 1\u00b75 years (EMA), 1\u00b73 years (FDA), and 0\u00b79 years (PMDA). Pharmacists can substitute biosimilars for reference biologics in some EU countries, but not in the USA or Japan. US regulation prohibits substitution, unless the biosimilar has been approved as interchangeable, a designation not yet achieved for any biosimilar in the USA. Japan does not permit biosimilar substitution, as prescribers must include the product name on each prescription and that specific product must be given to the patient. Policy Reviews published in 2014 and 2016 in The Lancet Oncology focused on premarket and postmarket policies for oncology biosimilars before most of these drugs received regulatory approval. In this Policy Review from the Southern Network on Adverse Reactions, we identify factors preventing the effective launch of oncology biosimilars. Introduction to the market has been more challenging with therapeutic than for supportive care oncology biosimilars. Addressing region-specific competition barriers and educational needs would improve the regulatory approval process and market launches for these biologics, therefore expanding patient access to these products in the EU, the USA, and Japan.","1071":"Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni snails (n = 833) were sampled from 29 sites in Sichuan, China, genotyped, and analyzed using Bayesian assignment to estimate the rate of recent snail migration across sites. Landscape connectivity between each site pair was estimated using the geographic distance distributions derived from nine environmental models: Euclidean, topography, incline, wetness, land use, watershed, stream use, streams and channels, and stream velocity. Among sites, 14.4% to 32.8% of sampled snails were identified as recent migrants, with 20 sites comprising >20% migrants. Migration rates were generally low between sites, but at 8 sites, over 10% of the overall host population originated from one proximal site. Greater landscape connectivity was significantly associated with increased odds of migration, with the minimum path distance (as opposed to median or first quartile) emerging as the strongest predictor across all environmental models. Models accounting for land use explained the largest proportion of the variance in migration rates between sites. A greater number of irrigation channels leading into a site was associated with an increase in the site's propensity to both attract and retain snails.Our findings have important implications for controlling the geographic spread of schistosomiasis in China, through improved understanding of the dispersal capacity of the parasite's intermediate host.While the dispersal of hosts and vectors-through active or passive movement-is known to facilitate the spread and re-emergence of certain infectious diseases, little is known about the movement ecology of Oncomelania spp., intermediate snail host of the parasite Schistosoma japonicum, and its consequences for the spread of schistosomiasis in East and Southeast Asia. In China, despite intense control programs aimed at preventing schistosomiasis transmission, there is evidence in recent years of re-emergence and persistence of infection in some areas, as well as an increase in the spatial extent of the snail host. A quantitative understanding of the dispersal characteristics of the intermediate host can provide new insights into the spatial dynamics of transmission, and can assist public health officials in limiting the geographic spread of infection.","1072":"NICUs showed variations in maternal and neonatal characteristics and resources. The unadjusted funnel plots for neonatal outcomes showed apparent variation with multiple centres outside the 99.8% control limits of the network values. The hierarchical model-based risk-adjustment accounting for differences in patient characteristics showed that discharged home with oxygen is the only outcome above the 99.8% control limits.Hierarchical model-based risk-adjusted estimates of morbidity rates plotted on funnel plots provide a robust and straightforward visual graphical tool for presenting variations in outcome performance to detect aberrations in healthcare delivery and guide timely intervention. We propose using hierarchical model-based risk adjustment and funnel plots in real or near real-time to detect aberrations and start timely intervention.Early and late confirmed sepsis, intraventricular haemorrhage, medically and surgically treated patent ductus arteriosus, chronic lung disease (CLD), postnatal steroid for CLD, necrotising enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), surgery for ROP, hospital mortality and home oxygen.Cohort study using prospectively collected data.All live-born infants born between 23+0 and 31+6 weeks gestation admitted to one of the tertiary perinatal centres from 2007 to 2020 (n=12\u2009608).There is an expectation among the public and within the profession that the performance and outcome of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) should be comparable between centres with a similar setting.

Serotype evolutions under the influence of the childhood PCV program should be closely monitored.A static multi-cohort model was developed simulating the consequences of pneumococcal vaccination in adults over 50 from a health care payer's perspective, for different scenarios of duration of vaccine protection and serotype evolution.To explore the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating healthy adults over 50, with either PCV13 or PPV23 alone, or with a combined strategy using both PCV13 and PPV23.A recent trial demonstrated the 13 valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13) to be effective against invasive and non-invasive pneumococcal disease in healthy adults. PCV13 might therefore be considered as an alternative to the 23 valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23).At currently expected prices, PCV13 vaccination of healthy adults over 50 is unlikely to be cost-effective either compared with no vaccination or in combination with PPV23 versus PPV23 only.","1074":"The World Health Organization declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern in July 2022. To investigate global mpox transmission and quantify the effect of population-level interventions on controlling spread, we built phylogeographic and phylodynamic models to analyze MPXV genomes from five global regions together with air traffic and epidemiological data. Our models reveal community transmission prior to detection, changes in case-reporting throughout the epidemic, and a large degree of transmission heterogeneity. We find that viral introductions played a limited role in prolonging spread after initial dissemination, suggesting that travel bans would have had only a minor impact. We find that mpox transmission in North America began declining before more than 10% of high-risk individuals in the USA had vaccine-induced immunity. Given that cases quickly declined after detection most likely due to behavioral modifications, our findings highlight the importance of broader routine specimen screening surveillance for emerging infectious diseases.","1075":"Ultraviolet light in the UVC range is a commonly used disinfectant to control viruses in clinical settings and water treatment. However, it is currently unknown whether human viral pathogens may develop resistance to such stressor. Here, we investigate the adaptation of an enteric pathogen, human echovirus 11, to disinfection by UVC, and characterized the underlying phenotypic and genotypic changes. Repeated exposure to UVC lead to a reduction in the UVC inactivation rate of approximately 15 per cent compared to that of the wild-type and the control populations. Time-series next-generation sequencing data revealed that this adaptation to UVC was accompanied by a decrease in the virus mutation rate. The inactivation efficiency of UVC was additionally compromised by a shift from first-order to biphasic inactivation kinetics, a form of 'viral persistence' present in the UVC resistant and control populations. Importantly, populations with biphasic inactivation kinetics also exhibited resistance to ribavirin, an antiviral drug that, as UVC, interferes with the viral replication. Overall, the ability of echovirus 11 to adapt to UVC is limited, but it may have relevant consequences for disinfection in clinical settings and water treatment plants.","1076":"Background\r\nThrombocytopenia is a common finding in adults with severe falciparum malaria, but its clinical and prognostic utility is incompletely defined.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nClinical and laboratory data from 647 adults with severe falciparum malaria were analysed retrospectively to determine the relationship between a patient\u0092s platelet count on admission to hospital and their subsequent clinical course.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nOn admission, 614 patients (94.9%) were thrombocytopenic (platelet count <150\u2009\u00d7\u2009109\/L) and 328 (50.7%) had a platelet count <50\u2009\u00d7\u2009109\/L. The admission platelet count was inversely correlated with parasite biomass (estimated from plasma PfHRP2 concentrations, rs\u2009=\u2009\u22120.28, P\u2009=\u20090.003), the degree of microvascular sequestration (measured with orthogonal polarizing spectral imaging, rs\u2009=\u2009\u22120.31, P\u2009=\u20090.001) and disease severity (the number of World Health Organization severity criteria satisfied by the patient, rs\u2009=\u2009\u22120.21, P <0.001). Platelet counts were lower on admission in the patients who died (median: 30 (interquartile range 22 to 52)\u2009\u00d7\u2009109\/L versus 50 (34 to 78)\u2009\u00d7\u2009109\/L in survivors; P <0.001), but did not predict outcome independently from other established laboratory and clinical prognostic indices. The 39 patients (6%) with profound thrombocytopenia (platelet count <20\u2009\u00d7\u2009109\/L) were more likely to die (odds ratio: 5.00, 95% confidence interval: 2.56 to 9.75) than patients with higher platelet counts, but these high-risk patients could be identified more rapidly with simple bedside clinical assessment. The admission platelet count did not reliably identify the 50 patients (7.7%) with major bleeding during the study.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nThrombocytopenia is a marker of disease severity in adults with falciparum malaria, but has limited utility in prognostication, triage and management.","1077":"Using a simulation-based model of viral transmission, we tested the efficacy of different intervention measures to control local COVID-19 outbreaks. For individuals that were identified through contact tracing, we evaluate two procedures: monitoring individuals for symptoms onset and testing of individuals. Additionally, we investigate the implementation of an antiviral compound combined with the contact tracing process.Current outbreaks of COVID-19 are threatening the health care systems of several countries around the world. Control measures, based on isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine, can decrease and delay the burden of the ongoing epidemic. With respect to the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, recent modeling work shows that these interventions may be inadequate to control local outbreaks, even when perfect isolation is assumed. The effect of infectiousness prior to symptom onset combined with asymptomatic infectees further complicates the use of contact tracing. We aim to study whether antivirals, which decrease the viral load and reduce infectiousness, could be integrated into control measures in order to augment the feasibility of controlling the epidemic.For an infectious disease in which asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections are plausible, an intervention measure based on contact tracing performs better when combined with testing instead of monitoring, provided that the test is able to detect infections during the incubation period. Antiviral drugs, in combination with contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation, result in a significant decrease of the final size and the peak incidence, and increase the probability that the outbreak will fade out.In all tested scenarios, the model highlights the benefits of control measures based on the testing of traced individuals. In addition, the administration of an antiviral drug, together with quarantine, isolation, and contact tracing, is shown to decrease the spread of the epidemic. This control measure could be an effective strategy to control local and re-emerging outbreaks of COVID-19.","1078":"Few countries in Africa currently include rubella-containing vaccination (RCV) in their immunization schedule. The Global Alliance for Vaccines Initiative (GAVI) recently opened a funding window that has motivated more widespread roll-out of RCV. As countries plan RCV introductions, an understanding of the existing burden, spatial patterns of vaccine coverage, and the impact of patterns of local extinction and reintroduction for rubella will be critical to developing effective programmes. As one of the first countries proposing RCV introduction in part with GAVI funding, Madagascar provides a powerful and timely case study. We analyse serological data from measles surveillance systems to characterize the epidemiology of rubella in Madagascar. Combining these results with data on measles vaccination delivery, we develop an age-structured model to simulate rubella vaccination scenarios and evaluate the dynamics of rubella and the burden of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) across Madagascar. We additionally evaluate the drivers of spatial heterogeneity in age of infection to identify focal locations where vaccine surveillance should be strengthened and where challenges to successful vaccination introduction are expected. Our analyses indicate that characteristics of rubella in Madagascar are in line with global observations, with an average age of infection near 7 years, and an impact of frequent local extinction with reintroductions causing localized epidemics. Modelling results indicate that introduction of RCV into the routine programme alone may initially decrease rubella incidence but then result in cumulative increases in the burden of CRS in some regions (and transient increases in this burden in many regions). Deployment of RCV with regular supplementary campaigns will mitigate these outcomes. Results suggest that introduction of RCV offers a potential for elimination of rubella in Madagascar, but also emphasize both that targeted vaccination is likely to be a lynchpin of this success, and the public health vigilance that this introduction will require. ","1079":"Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) exist when there is heritable variation in one species' ability to alter a second species' traits. For example, parasites can evolve disparate strategies to manipulate host immune response, whether by evading detection or suppressing immunity. A complication arises during coinfection, when two or more parasite genotypes may try to impose distinct IGEs on the same host trait: which parasite's IGE will be dominant? Here, we apply the notion of dominance to IGEs during coinfection. Using a mathematical model we show that the dominance of IGEs can alter the evolutionary dynamics of parasites. We consider a resident parasite population receiving rare immigrants with a different immune manipulation trait. These immigrants' relative fitness depends on resident prevalence (e.g., the probability immigrants are alone in a host, or coinfecting with a native), and the dominance of the immigrant's IGE on host immunity. Next, we show experimentally that the cestode Schistocephalus solidus exerts an IGE on a host immune trait: parasite antigens from different populations produced different intensities of fibrosis. We then evaluated IGE dominance, finding evidence for overdominance (coinjected antigens induced an even stronger host immune response) which would be detrimental to immigrants when resident prevalence is high. This combination of experimental and modeling results shows that parasites do exhibit IGEs on host traits, and that the dominance of these IGEs during coinfection can substantially alter parasite evolution.","1080":"Overall, the findings suggest that age, facial attractiveness, education, and multilingualism do have some impact on web-based doctor reviews, but the numerical effect is small. Notably, bias may play out in many forms. For example, a physician's appearance or accent may impact a patient's trust, confidence, or satisfaction with their physician, which could in turn influence their take-up of preventative services and lead to either better or worse health outcomes. The study highlights the need for further research in how physician characteristics influence patient ratings of care.The average overall rating on Zocdoc was highly positive, with older age, lower facial attractiveness, foreign degrees, allopathic degrees, and speaking more languages negatively associated with the average rating. However, the effect sizes of these factors were relatively small. For example, graduates of Latin American medical schools had a mean overall rating of 4.63 compared to a 4.77 rating for US graduates (P<.001), a difference roughly equivalent to a 2.8% decrease in appointments. On multivariate analysis, being Asian and having a doctor of osteopathic medicine degree were positively associated with higher overall ratings, while attending a South Asian medical school and speaking more European and Middle Eastern languages in the office were negatively associated with higher overall ratings.A data set of 1455 primary care doctor profiles across 30 cities was scraped from Zocdoc. The profiles contained information on the physician's gender, education, and languages spoken in their office. Age, facial attractiveness, and race were imputed from profile pictures using commercial facial analysis software. Each doctor profile listed an average overall satisfaction rating, bedside manner rating, and wait time rating from verified patients. Descriptive statistics, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the data.Doctor review websites have become increasingly popular as a source of information for patients looking to select a primary care provider. Zocdoc is one such platform that allows patients to not only rate and review their experiences with doctors but also directly schedule appointments. This study examines how several physician characteristics including gender, age, race, languages spoken in a physician's office, education, and facial attractiveness impact the average numerical rating of primary care doctors on Zocdoc.The aim of this study was to investigate the association between physician characteristics and patient satisfaction ratings on Zocdoc.","1081":"To fill this gap in the literature, we compared infectious disease reporting for three diseases (measles, mumps, and varicella) across four different data sources: Optum (health insurance billing claims data), HealthMap (online news surveillance data), Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports (official government reports), and National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (government case surveillance data). We reported the yearly number of national- and state-level disease-specific case counts and disease clusters according to each of our sources during a five-year study period (2013-2017).Our study demonstrated drastic differences in reported infectious disease incidence across data sources. When compared against the other three sources of interest, Optum data showed substantially higher, implausible standardized case counts for all three diseases. Although there was some concordance in identified state-level case counts and disease clusters, all four sources identified variations in state-level reporting.As highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers are eager to make use of a wide variety of data sources, both government-sponsored and alternative, to characterize the epidemiology of infectious diseases. To date, few studies have investigated the strengths and limitations of sources currently being used for such research. These are critical for policy makers to understand when interpreting study findings.Researchers should consider data source limitations when attempting to characterize the epidemiology of infectious diseases. Some data sources, such as billing claims data, may be unsuitable for epidemiological research within the infectious disease context.","1082":"Infectious disease-causing pathogens can be transmitted via contact with contaminated environmental surfaces (i.e., fomite transmission). However, the physical mechanism of fomite transmission remains unclear because of a lack of suitable surrogate tracers. In this study, the non-toxic, non-human-origin and gram-positive bacterium Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus was selected as a tracer, and its applicability for studying bacterial contamination spread on environmental surfaces was investigated in an office setting. After bacterial introduction by a designated carrier, surface contamination levels indicated by the L. bulgaricus proline iminopeptidase (pepIP) gene copy numbers were quantified using an optimized qPCR assay. This qPCR assay exhibited a high sensitivity (55 copies per reaction mixture and 1585 copies per surface sample), a wide dynamic range (7 orders of magnitude) and a high specificity for pepIP gene in environmental surface samples. Three independent, natural and unsupervised field experiments involving human participants confirmed the applicability of L. bulgaricus as a tracer in field studies and the pepIP gene as a unique marker of externally introduced contamination. Experimentally, contamination was distributed nearly equally over public surfaces, the carrier's seat location and the other seat locations in the office setting. An analysis by seat location revealed that the contamination level was attenuated as the physical distance from the carrier's seat location increased. Volunteers' faces were ubiquitously contaminated, suggesting a potentially high risk of fomite exposure via mucous membranes. In conclusion, L. bulgaricus can feasibly be used as a tracer organism in future large-scale field studies of bacterial contamination spread on environmental surfaces.","1083":"With approximately half of the world's population at risk of contracting dengue, this mosquito-borne disease is of global concern. International travellers significantly contribute to dengue's rapid and large-scale spread by importing the disease from endemic into non-endemic countries. To prevent future outbreaks and dengue from establishing in non-endemic countries, knowledge about the arrival time and location of infected travellers is crucial. We propose a network model that predicts the monthly number of dengue-infected air passengers arriving at any given airport. We consider international air travel volumes to construct weighted networks, representing passenger flows between airports. We further calculate the probability of passengers, who travel through the international air transport network, being infected with dengue. The probability of being infected depends on the destination, duration and timing of travel. Our findings shed light onto dengue importation routes and reveal country-specific reporting rates that have been until now largely unknown. This paper provides important new knowledge about the spreading dynamics of dengue that is highly beneficial for public health authorities to strategically allocate the often limited resources to more efficiently prevent the spread of dengue.","1084":"Seroprevalence studies assessing community exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Ghana concluded that population-level immunity remained low as of February 2021. Thus, it is important to demonstrate how increasing vaccine coverage reduces the economic and public health impacts associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission. To that end, this study used a Susceptible-Exposed-Presymptomatic-Symptomatic-Asymptomatic-Recovered-Dead-Vaccinated compartmental model to simulate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission and the role of public health interventions in Ghana. The impact of increasing vaccination rates and decline in transmission rates due to nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on cumulative infections and deaths averted was explored under different scenarios. Latin hypercube sampling-partial rank correlation coefficient (LHS-PRCC) was used to investigate the uncertainty and sensitivity of the outcomes to the parameters. Simulation results suggest that increasing the vaccination rate to achieve 50% coverage was associated with almost 60,000 deaths and 25 million infections averted. In comparison, a 50% decrease in the transmission coefficient was associated with the prevention of about 150,000 deaths and 50 million infections. The LHS-PRCC results indicated that in the context of vaccination rate, cumulative infections and deaths averted were most sensitive to vaccination rate, waning immunity rates from vaccination, and waning immunity from natural infection. This study's findings illustrate the impact of increasing vaccination coverage and\/or reducing the transmission rate by NPI adherence in the prevention of COVID-19 infections and deaths in Ghana.","1085":"The gap between domain experts and natural language processing expertise is a barrier to extracting understanding from clinical text. We describe a prototype tool for interactive review and revision of natural language processing models of binary concepts extracted from clinical notes. We evaluated our prototype in a user study involving 9 physicians, who used our tool to build and revise models for 2 colonoscopy quality variables. We report changes in performance relative to the quantity of feedback. Using initial training sets as small as 10 documents, expert review led to final F1scores for the \"appendiceal-orifice\" variable between 0.78 and 0.91 (with improvements ranging from 13.26% to 29.90%). F1for \"biopsy\" ranged between 0.88 and 0.94 (-1.52% to 11.74% improvements). The average System Usability Scale score was 70.56. Subjective feedback also suggests possible design improvements.","1086":"Cholera remains a persistent health problem in sub-Saharan Africa and worldwide. Cholera can be controlled through appropriate water and sanitation, or by oral cholera vaccination, which provides transient (\u223c3 years) protection, although vaccine supplies remain scarce. We aimed to map cholera burden in sub-Saharan Africa and assess how geographical targeting could lead to more efficient interventions.We included 279 datasets covering 2283 locations in our analyses. In sub-Saharan Africa (excluding Djibouti and Eritrea), a mean of 141\u2008918 cholera cases (95% credible interval [CrI] 141\u2008538-146\u2008505) were reported per year. 4\u00b70% (95% CrI 1\u00b77-16\u00b78) of districts, home to 87\u00b72 million people (95% CrI 60\u00b73 million to 118\u00b79 million), have high cholera incidence. By focusing on the highest incidence districts first, effective targeted interventions could eliminate 50% of the region's cholera by covering 35\u00b73 million people (95% CrI 26\u00b73 million to 62\u00b70 million), which is less than 4% of the total population.The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.We combined information on cholera incidence in sub-Saharan Africa (excluding Djibouti and Eritrea) from 2010 to 2016 from datasets from WHO, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, ProMED, ReliefWeb, ministries of health, and the scientific literature. We divided the study region into 20 km\u2008\u00d7\u200820 km grid cells and modelled annual cholera incidence in each grid cell assuming a Poisson process adjusted for covariates and spatially correlated random effects. We combined these findings with data on population distribution to estimate the number of people living in areas of high cholera incidence (>1 case per 1000 people per year). We further estimated the reduction in cholera incidence that could be achieved by targeting cholera prevention and control interventions at areas of high cholera incidence.Although cholera occurs throughout sub-Saharan Africa, its highest incidence is concentrated in a small proportion of the continent. Prioritising high-risk areas could substantially increase the efficiency of cholera control programmes.","1087":"76 588 participants were included, of whom 27 352 (37.4%) deteriorated and 12 581 (17.4%) died. Both the 4C Mortality (0.78 (0.77 to 0.78)) and 4C Deterioration scores (pooled C-statistic 0.76 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.77)) demonstrated consistent discrimination across all nine National Health Service regions, with similar performance metrics to the original validation cohorts. Calibration remained stable (4C Mortality: pooled slope 1.09, pooled calibration-in-the-large 0.12; 4C Deterioration: 1.00, -0.04), with no need for temporal recalibration during the second UK pandemic wave of hospital admissions.Prospective observational cohort study of adults (age \u226518 years) with confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19 recruited into the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) study in 306 hospitals across England, Scotland and Wales. Patients were recruited between 27 August 2020 and 17 February 2021, with at least 4\u2009weeks follow-up before final data extraction. The main outcome measures were discrimination and calibration of models for in-hospital deterioration (defined as any requirement of ventilatory support or critical care, or death) and mortality, incorporating predefined subgroups.ISRCTN66726260.To prospectively validate two risk scores to predict mortality (4C Mortality) and in-hospital deterioration (4C Deterioration) among adults hospitalised with COVID-19.Both 4C risk stratification models demonstrate consistent performance to predict clinical deterioration and mortality in a large prospective second wave validation cohort of UK patients. Despite recent advances in the treatment and management of adults hospitalised with COVID-19, both scores can continue to inform clinical decision making.","1088":"Insect-pathogen dynamics can show seasonal and inter-annual variation that covaries with fluctuations in insect abundance and climate. Long-term analyses are especially needed to track parasite dynamics in migratory insects, in part because their vast habitat ranges and high mobility might dampen local effects of density and climate on infection prevalence. Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) are commonly infected with the protozoan Ophryocystis elektroscirrha (OE). Because this parasite lowers monarch survival and flight performance, and because migratory monarchs have experienced declines in recent decades, it is important to understand patterns and drivers of infection. 3. Here we compiled data on OE infection spanning 50 years, from wild monarchs sampled in the USA, Canada, and Mexico during summer breeding, fall migrating, and overwintering periods. We examined eastern versus western North American monarchs separately, to ask how abundance estimates, resource availability, climate, and breeding season length impact infection trends. We further assessed the intensity of migratory culling, which occurs when infected individuals are removed from the population during migration. 4. Average infection prevalence was four times higher in western compared to eastern subpopulations. In eastern North America, the proportion of infected monarchs increased three-fold since the mid-2000s. In the western region, the proportion of infected monarchs declined sharply from 2000-2015, and increased thereafter. For both eastern and western subpopulations, years with greater summer adult abundance predicted greater infection prevalence, indicating that transmission increases with host breeding density. Environmental variables (temperature and NDVI) were not associated with changes in infected adults. We found evidence for migratory culling of infected butterflies, based on declines in parasitism during fall migration. We estimated that tens of millions fewer monarchs reach overwintering sites in Mexico as a result of OE, highlighting the need to consider the parasite as a potential threat to the monarch population. 5. Increases in infection among eastern North American monarchs post-2002 suggest that changes to the host's ecology or environment have intensified parasite transmission. Further work is needed to examine the degree to which human practices, such as mass caterpillar rearing and the widespread planting of exotic milkweed, have contributed to this trend.","1089":") were associated with feed barley equivalent meat imports. While the UK barley production would be entirely green, imports of either barley or meat would result in large blue water inflows to the UK. Virtual water inflows increased across the time slices for all emissions scenarios, indicating weak effectiveness of yield or productivity gains to moderate virtual water inflows. While increase in yield and land allocated to barley production should be adaptive targets, the UK needs to take policy and strategic actions to diversify trade partners and shift imports away from countries where blue water flows can exacerbate existing or potential water stresses.","1090":"Understanding regional molecular epidemiology allows for the development of more efficient tuberculosis prevention strategies in low-incidence settings.We analyzed 24-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit-variable-number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) genotyping for 2290 Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates collected in the province of British Columbia (BC), Canada, in 2005-2014. Laboratory data for each isolate were linked to case-level clinical and demographic data. These data were used to describe the molecular epidemiology of tuberculosis across the province.We detected >1500 distinct genotypes across the 4 major M. tuberculosis lineages, reflecting BC's diverse population. Disease site and clustering rates varied across lineages, and MIRU-VNTR was used to group the 2290 isolates into 189 clusters (2-70 isolates per cluster), with an overall clustering rate of 42.4% and an estimated local transmission rate of 34.1%. Risk factors for clustering varied between Canadian-born and foreign-born individuals; the former had increased odds (odds ratio, 7.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.2-9.6) of belonging to a genotypic cluster, although nearly one-quarter of clusters included both Canadian- and foreign-born persons. Large clusters (\u226510 cases) occurred more frequently within the M. tuberculosis Euro-American lineage, and individual-level risk factors associated with belonging to a large cluster included being Canadian born (adjusted odds ratio, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.3-4.8), residing in a rural area (2.3; 1.2-4.5), and illicit drug use (2.0; 1.2-3.4).Although tuberculosis in BC largely arises through reactivation of latent tuberculosis in foreign-born persons, locally transmitted infections occur in discrete populations with distinct disease and risk factor profiles, representing groups for targeted interventions.","1091":"Two serious public health challenges have emerged in the current COVID-19 pandemic namely, deficits in SARS-CoV-2 variant monitoring and neglect of other co-circulating respiratory viruses. Additionally, accurate assessment of the evolution, extent, and dynamics of the outbreak is required to understand the transmission of the virus. To address these challenges, we evaluated 533 samples using a high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) respiratory viral panel (RVP) that includes 40 viral pathogens. The performance metrics revealed a PPA, NPA, and accuracy of 95.98%, 85.96%, and 94.4%, respectively. The clade for pangolin lineage B that contains certain distant variants, including P4715L in ORF1ab, Q57H in ORF3a, and S84L in ORF8 covarying with the D614G spike protein mutation, were the most prevalent early in the pandemic in Georgia, USA. The isolates from the same county formed paraphyletic groups, indicating virus transmission between counties. The study demonstrates the clinical and public health utility of the NGS-RVP to identify novel variants that can provide actionable information to prevent or mitigate emerging viral threats and models that provide insights into viral transmission patterns and predict transmission\/resurgence of regional outbreaks as well as providing critical information on co-circulating respiratory viruses that might be independent factors contributing to the global disease burden.","1092":"Fluoroquinolone resistance can be conferred through chromosomal mutations or by the acquisition of plasmids carrying genes such as the quinolone resistance gene (qnr). In this study, 3,309 strains of commensal Escherichia coli were isolated in Ecuador from: (i) humans and chickens in a rural northern coastal area (n = 2368, 71.5%) and (ii) chickens from an industrial poultry operation (n = 827, 25%). In addition, 114 fluoroquinolone-resistant strains from patients with urinary tract infections who were treated at three urban hospitals in Quito, Ecuador were analyzed. All of the isolates were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility screening. Fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates (FRIs) were then screened for the presence of qnrB genes. A significantly higher phenotypic resistance to fluoroquinolones was determined in E. coli strains from chickens in both the rural area (22%) and the industrial operation (10%) than in strains isolated from humans in the rural communities (3%). However, the rates of qnrB genes in E. coli isolates from healthy humans in the rural communities (11 of 35 isolates, 31%) was higher than in chickens from either the industrial operations (3 of 81 isolates, 6%) or the rural communities (7 of 251 isolates, 2.8%). The occurrence of qnrB genes in human FRIs obtained from urban hospitals was low (1 of 114 isolates, 0.9%). These results suggested that the qnrB gene is more widely distributed in rural settings, where antibiotic usage is low, than in urban hospitals and industrial poultry operations. The role of qnrB in clinical resistance to fluoroquinolones is thus far unknown.","1093":"The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has gravely impacted societies around the world. Outbreaks in different parts of the globe have been shaped by repeated introductions of new viral lineages and subsequent local transmission of those lineages. Here, we sequenced 3940 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from Washington State to characterize how the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Washington State (USA) in early 2020 was shaped by differences in timing of mitigation strategies across counties, as well as by repeated introductions of viral lineages into the state. Additionally, we show that the increase in frequency of a potentially more transmissible viral variant (614G) over time can potentially be explained by regional mobility differences and multiple introductions of 614G, but not the other variant (614D) into the state. At an individual level, we observed evidence of higher viral loads in patients infected with the 614G variant. However, using clinical records data, we did not find any evidence that the 614G variant impacts clinical severity or patient outcomes. Overall, this suggests that with regards to D614G, the behavior of individuals has been more important in shaping the course of the pandemic in Washington State than this variant of the virus.","1094":"Palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody and the only licensed immunization product for preventing respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, is recommended for children with certain high-risk conditions. Other antibody products and maternal vaccines targeting young infants are in clinical development. Few studies have compared products closest to potential licensure and have primarily focused on the effects on hospitalizations only. Estimates of the impact of these products on medically-attended (MA) infections in a variety of healthcare settings are needed to assist with developing RSV immunization recommendations.We developed a tool for practicing public health officials to estimate the impact of immunization strategies on RSV-associated MA lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in various healthcare settings among infants <12\u202fmonths. Users input RSV burden and seasonality and examine the influence of altering product efficacy and uptake assumptions. We used the tool to evaluate candidate products' impacts among a US birth cohort.We estimated without immunization, 407,360 (range: 339,650-475,980) LRTIs are attended annually in outpatient clinics, 147,240 (126,070-168,510) in emergency departments (EDs), and 33,180 (24,760-42,900) in hospitals. A passive antibody candidate targeting all infants prevented the most LRTIs: 196,470 (48% of visits without immunization) outpatient clinic visits (range: 163,810-229,650), 75,250 (51%) EDs visits (64,430-86,090), and 18,140 (55%) hospitalizations (13,770-23,160). A strategy combining maternal vaccine candidate and palivizumab prevented 58,210 (14% of visits without immunization) LRTIs in outpatient clinics (range: 48,520-67,970), 19,580 (13%) in EDs (16,760-22,400), and 8,190 (25%) hospitalizations (6,390-10,150).Results underscore the potential for anticipated products to reduce serious RSV illness. Our tool (provided to readers) can be used by different jurisdictions and accept updated data. Results can aid economic evaluations and public health decision-making regarding RSV immunization products.","1095":"Longitudinal reimbursement data on fluoroquinolone use in the Belgian community from January 2017 to November 2018 were analysed to identify a change in reimbursed fluoroquinolone use expressed in DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day (DID), using a set of non-linear mixed models including change-points. In addition, longitudinal data on the relative proportion of prescribed fluoroquinolones from January 2017 to December 2018 were analysed to identify a change in the relative proportion of prescribed fluoroquinolones using generalized estimation equations including change-points.Fluoroquinolone use dropped significantly immediately after the change in reimbursement criteria, from 2.21 DID (95% CI: 2.03-2.38) to 0.52 DID (95% CI: 0.48-0.56) and from 9.14% (95% CI: 8.75%-9.56%) to 6.52% (95% CI: 6.04%-7.04%). The observed decrease in fluoroquinolone use persisted over time.While fluoroquinolone use was still above the target of 5% after the change in reimbursement criteria, its implementation helped to lower fluoroquinolone use in Belgium.The criteria for the reimbursement of fluoroquinolones changed in Belgium on 1 May 2018. This study aims to quantify the difference in fluoroquinolone use after this change, and to assess the timing and persistence of this effect, both in terms of total reimbursed fluoroquinolone use and its relative proportion.","1096":"Malaria is one of the most common mosquito-borne diseases widespread in tropical and subtropical regions, causing thousands of deaths every year in the world. In a previous paper, we formulated an age-structured model containing three structural variables: (i) the chronological age of human and mosquito populations, (ii) the time since they are infected, and (iii) humans waning immunity (i.e. the progressive loss of protective antibodies after recovery). In the present paper, we expand the analysis of this age-structured model and focus on the derivation of entomological and epidemiological results commonly used in the literature, following the works of Smith and McKenzie. We generalize their results to the age-structured case. In order to quantify the impact of neglecting structuring variables such as chronological age, we assigned values from the literature to our model parameters. While some parameters values are readily accessible from the literature, at least those about the human population, the parameters concerning mosquitoes are less commonly documented and the values of a number of them (e.g. mosquito survival in the presence or in absence of infection) can be discussed extensively. Our analysis, informed by parameter values from the literature, demonstrates that overlooking those structural variables of human and mosquito populations may result in inaccurate epidemiological predictions and suboptimal control strategies. We highlight the epidemiological implications of these findings and emphasize the necessity of considering age structure in future malaria control programs.","1097":"Interacting particles on graphs are routinely used to study magnetic behavior in physics, disease spread in epidemiology, and opinion dynamics in social sciences. The literature on mean-field approximations of such systems for large graphs typically remains limited to specific dynamics, or assumes cluster-free graphs for which standard approximations based on degrees and pairs are often reasonably accurate. Here, we propose a motif-based mean-field approximation that considers higher-order subgraph structures in large clustered graphs. Numerically, our equations\u00a0agree with stochastic simulations where existing methods fail.","1098":"Few reports have suggested that non-Hispanic (NH) blacks may present with different symptoms for COVID-19 than NH-whites. The objective of this study was to investigate patterns in symptomatology and COVID-19 outcomes by race\/ethnicity among adults in Arkansas. Data on COVID-19 symptoms were collected on day of testing, 7th and 14th day among participants at UAMS mobile testing units throughout the state of Arkansas. Diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed via nasopharyngeal swab and RT-PCR methods. Data analysis was conducted using Chi-square test and Poisson regression to assess the differences in characteristics by race\/ethnicity. A total of 60,648 individuals were RT-PCR tested from March 29, 2020 through October 7, 2020. Among adults testing positive, except shortness of breath, Hispanics were more likely to report all symptoms than NH-whites or NH-blacks. NH-whites were more likely to report fever (19.6% vs. 16.6%), cough (27.5% vs. 26.1%), shortness of breath (13.6% vs. 9.6%), sore throat (16.7% vs. 10.7%), chills (12.5% vs. 11.8%), muscle pain (15.6% vs. 12.4%), and headache (20.3% vs. 17.8%). NH-blacks were more likely to report loss of taste\/smell (10.9% vs. 10.6%). To conclude, we found differences in COVID-19 symptoms by race\/ethnicity, with NH-blacks and Hispanics more often affected with specific or all symptoms, compared to NH-whites. Due to the cross-sectional study design, these findings do not necessarily reflect biological differences by race\/ethnicity; however, they suggest that certain race\/ethnicities may have underlying differences in health status that impact COVID-19 outcomes.","1099":"Vaccine exemptions, which allow unvaccinated children to attend school, have increased by a factor of 28 since 2003 in Texas. Geographic clustering of unvaccinated children facilitates the spread of measles introductions, but the potential size of outbreaks is unclear.To forecast the range of measles outbreak sizes in each metropolitan area of Texas at 2018 and future reduced school vaccination rates.This study suggests that vaccination rates in some Texas schools are currently low enough to allow large measles outbreaks. Further decreases are associated with dramatic increases in the probability of large outbreaks. Limiting vaccine exemptions could be associated with a decrease in the risk of large measles outbreaks.An agent-based decision analytical model using a synthetic population of Texas, derived from the 2010 US Census, was used to simulate measles transmission in the Texas population. Real schools were represented in the simulations, and the 2018 vaccination rate of each real school was applied to a simulated hypothetical equivalent. Single cases of measles were introduced, daily activities and interactions were modeled for each population member, and the number of infections over the course of 9 months was counted for 1000 simulated runs in each Texas metropolitan area.To determine the outcomes of further decreases in vaccination coverage, additional simulations were performed with vaccination rates reduced by 1% to 10% in schools with populations that are currently undervaccinated.At 2018 vaccination rates, the median number of cases in large metropolitan areas was typically small, ranging from 1 to 3 cases, which is consistent with outbreaks in Texas 2006 to 2017. However, the upper limit of the distribution of plausible outbreaks (the 95th percentile, associated with 1 in 20 measles introductions) exceeded 400 cases in both the Austin and Dallas metropolitan areas, similar to the largest US outbreaks since measles was eliminated in 2000. Decreases in vaccination rates in schools with undervaccinated populations in 2018 were associated with exponential increases in the potential size of outbreaks: a 5% decrease in vaccination rate was associated with a 40% to 4000% increase in potential outbreak size, depending on the metropolitan area. A mean (SD) of 64% (11%) of cases occurred in students for whom a vaccine had been refused, but a mean (SD) of 36% (11%) occurred in others (ie, bystanders).Expected distributions of outbreak sizes in each metropolitan area of Texas at 2018 and reduced vaccination rates.","1100":"Characterizing the effect of vaccination on long COVID allows for better healthcare recommendations.Long COVID has become a central concern for public health experts. Prior studies have considered the effect of vaccination on the prevalence of future long COVID symptoms, but ours is the first to thoroughly characterize the association between vaccination and clinically diagnosed or computationally derived long COVID. Our results bolster the growing consensus that vaccines retain protective effects against long COVID even in breakthrough infections.Question: Does vaccination prior to COVID-19 onset change the risk of long COVID diagnosis?Findings: Four observational analyses of EHRs showed a statistically significant reduction in long COVID risk associated with pre-COVID vaccination (first cohort: HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55-0.80; OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.59-0.82; second cohort: HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.56-0.69; OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.65-0.75).Meaning: Vaccination prior to COVID onset has a protective association with long COVID even in the case of breakthrough infections.To determine if, and to what degree, vaccination prior to COVID-19 is associated with eventual long COVID onset, among those a documented COVID-19 infection.In both cohorts, when adjusting for demographics and medical history, pre-COVID vaccination was associated with a reduced risk of long COVID (clinic-based cohort: HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55-0.80; OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.59-0.82; model-based cohort: HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.56-0.69; OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.65-0.75).Retrospective cohort study of adults with evidence of COVID-19 between August 1, 2021 and January 31, 2022 based on electronic health records from eleven healthcare institutions taking part in the NIH Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative, a project of the National Covid Cohort Collaborative (N3C).Two approaches to the identification of long COVID were used. In the clinical diagnosis cohort (n=47,752), ICD-10 diagnosis codes or evidence of a healthcare encounter at a long COVID clinic were used. In the model-based cohort (n=199,498), a computable phenotype was used.

Here, we provide a data-driven 'watch list' of viruses in the Flaviviridae family with high potential to emerge in the USA, identified using statistical techniques, to enable the public health community to better target surveillance. We suggest that public health authorities further incorporate predictive modeling techniques into disease-prevention strategies.","1102":"The available published evidence is insufficient to establish whether prenatal exposure to ambient air pollution increases risk of LRTIs in children and adolescents. With many populations exposed to high levels of air pollution, there is an urgent need for research in more diverse settings, more transparent reporting of methods, and exploring how, when, and for whom prenatal exposure to ambient air pollution leads to the greatest health risks.We systematically searched Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection, CINAHL, and Global Health up to May 17, 2024. We included peer-reviewed publications of studies which investigated the association between prenatal exposure to ambient air pollution and LRTIs up to the age of 19. We excluded conference abstracts, study protocols, review articles, and grey literature. Screening and data extraction was conducted by two reviewers independently. We used the Office of Health Assessment and Translation tool to assess risk of bias and conducted a narrative synthesis.Pregnancy represents a critical window of vulnerability to the harmful effects of air pollution on health. However, long-term consequences such as risk of having lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are less explored. This systematic review aims to synthesize previous research on prenatal exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution and LRTIs in childhood and adolescence.CRD42023407689.The search yielded 6056 records, of which 16 publications describing 12 research studies were eligible for the synthesis. All studies were conducted in high- or upper-middle-income countries in Europe or Asia. Half (6) of the studies focused on LRTIs occurring within the first three years of life, and the others also included LRTIs in older children (up to age 14). Air pollutants investigated included nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, particulate matter (PM2.5: diameter \u22642.5\u00a0\u03bcm and PM10: diameter \u226410\u00a0\u03bcm), carbon monoxide, ozone, and benzene. Findings on a potential association between prenatal ambient air pollution exposure and LRTIs were inconclusive, without a clear and consistent direction. There was some suggestion of a positive association with prenatal PM2.5 exposure. The small number of studies identified, their poor geographical representation, and their methodological limitations including concerns for risk of bias preclude more definitive conclusions.","1103":"The eco-epidemiology of Triatominae and Trypanosoma cruzi transmission has been little studied in the Argentinean Monte ecoregion. Herein, we provide a comprehensive description of domestic and intrusive triatomines to evaluate the risk of reinfestation of rural dwellings. Triatoma infestans, T. patagonica, T. garciabesi and T. eratyrusiformis were collected by active searches or light traps. None were infected with T. cruzi. One T. infestans male was collected at 1.3\u2009km from the nearest infested house. The finding of intrusive and domestic triatomines in sylvatic foci emphasizes the need of implementing an effective vector surveillance system.","1104":"Predicting and disrupting transmission of human parasites from wildlife hosts or vectors remains challenging because ecological interactions can influence their epidemiological traits. Human schistosomes, parasitic flatworms that cycle between freshwater snails and humans, typify this challenge. Human exposure risk, given water contact, is driven by the production of free-living cercariae by snail populations. Conventional epidemiological models and management focus on the density of infected snails under the assumption that all snails are equally infectious. However, individual-level experiments contradict this assumption, showing increased production of schistosome cercariae with greater access to food resources. We built bioenergetics theory to predict how resource competition among snails drives the temporal dynamics of transmission potential to humans and tested these predictions with experimental epidemics and demonstrated consistency with field observations. This resource-explicit approach predicted an intense pulse of transmission potential when snail populations grow from low densities, i.e., when per capita access to resources is greatest, due to the resource-dependence of cercarial production. The experiment confirmed this prediction, identifying a strong effect of infected host size and the biomass of competitors on per capita cercarial production. A field survey of 109 waterbodies also found that per capita cercarial production decreased as competitor biomass increased. Further quantification of snail densities, sizes, cercarial production, and resources in diverse transmission sites is needed to assess the epidemiological importance of resource competition and support snail-based disruption of schistosome transmission. More broadly, this work illustrates how resource competition can sever the correspondence between infectious host density and transmission potential.","1105":"The four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1-4) cause major public health problems worldwide. Highly neutralizing type-specific human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) target conformation-dependent epitopes on the DENV envelope protein, including 1F4, a DENV1 type-specific hmAb. Using a recombinant DENV2 virus displaying the DENV1 1F4 epitope (rDENV2\/1), we measured the proportion and kinetics of DENV1 neutralizing antibodies targeting the 1F4 epitope in individuals living in Asia and the Americas where different DENV1 genotypes were circulating. Samples from 20 individuals were analyzed 3 and 18 months post-primary DENV1 infection, alongside samples from 4 individuals collected annually for four years post-primary DENV1 infection, from two studies in Nicaragua. We also analyzed convalescent post-primary DENV1 plasma samples from Sri Lankan individuals. We found that neutralizing antibodies recognizing the 1F4 epitope vary in prevalence across both populations and were detected from 20 days to four years post-infection. Additionally, both populations displayed substantial variability, with a range of high to low proportions of DENV1 type-specific neutralizing antibodies recognizing the 1F4 epitope seen across individuals. Thus, the 1F4 epitope is a major but not exclusive target of type-specific neutralizing antibodies post-primary infection with different DENV1 genotypes in Asia and Latin America, and additional epitopes likely contribute to type-specific neutralization of DENV1.","1106":"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a concomitant deluge of medical, biological, and epidemiologic research. Clinicians are rightly interested in incorporating the best new evidence-based practices when treating COVID-19 patients and instituting SARS-CoV-2 transmission prevention protocols. However, without sufficient background knowledge, evaluating epidemiologic studies can be challenging, and a failure to identify sources of bias could lead to poor treatment decisions. Here, we provide a brief primer on key concepts and terms related to COVID-19 epidemiology in the hopes that this information will help provide clinicians with a starting point for evaluating the emerging COVID-19 literature.","1107":". Interventions should focus on controlling waste from treated animals and, when possible, selecting antibiotics that are less likely to impact the proximal environment of treated animals.","1108":"A hybrid strategy in which CTA is performed in the first year and CDU is performed annually thereafter is the most cost-effective strategy for infrarenal EVAR surveillance in patients with less than a 20% risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. If the sensitivity of CEU and CDU are at the lower end of plausible estimates, a yearly CTA strategy is reasonable. Further research should aim to identify patients who may benefit from alternative surveillance strategies.While Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines recommend computed tomography angiography (CTA) or ultrasound for surveillance following infrarenal endovascular aortic repair (EVAR), there is a lack of consensus regarding optimal timing and modalities. We hypothesized that ultrasound-based approaches would be more cost-effective and developed a cost-effectiveness analysis to estimate the lifetime costs and outcomes of various strategies.Under base case assumptions, the CTA-CDU strategy was cost effective with a lifetime cost of $77950 for 7.74 QALYs. In sensitivity analysis, the CTA-CDU approach remained cost-effective when CEU specificity was less than 95%, and risk of acute kidney injury following CTA was less than 20%. At diagnostic sensitivities below 75% for CEU and 55% for CDU, a yearly CTA strategy maximized QALYs.We developed a decision tree with nested Markov models to compare five surveillance strategies: yearly CTA, yearly CDU, yearly CEU, CTA at first year followed by CDU, and CTA at first year followed by CEU. The model accounted for differential sensitivity, specificity, and risk of acute kidney injury after CTA, and was implemented on a monthly cycle with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and 3% annual discounting.","1109":" Infection by SARS-CoV-2 elicits antibodies against various domains of the spike protein, including the RBD and NTD of subunit S1 and against subunit S2. The antibody responses of different infected individuals exhibit different efficacies to inactivate (neutralize) the virus. Here, we show that the observed variation in the neutralizing activity of the antibody responses in COVID-19 convalescent subjects is caused by differences in the amounts of antibodies rather than their recognition properties or the potency of their antiviral activity. These findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccine strategies that focus on enhancing the overall level of the antibodies will likely elicit a more uniformly efficacious protective response.","1110":" spp. are naturally occurring fungi in arid soils. Little is known about ecological factors that influence the growth of these fungi, and a higher environmental burden may result in increases in human exposure and therefore case rates. By examining case and climate data from Arizona and using generalized additive statistical models, we were able to examine the relationship between disease outbreaks and climatic variables and predict seasonal time points of increased infection risk.","1111":" Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (YopH) is the most efficient enzyme among all known PTPases and relies on its catalytic loop movements for substrate binding and catalysis. Fluorescence, NMR, and UV resonance Raman (UVRR) techniques have been used to study the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of the loop motions. In this study, a computational approach based on the pathway refinement methods nudged elastic band (NEB) and harmonic Fourier beads (HFB) has been developed to provide structural interpretations for the experimentally observed kinetic processes. In this approach, the minimum potential energy pathways for the loop open\/closure conformational changes were determined by NEB using a one-dimensional global coordinate. Two dimensional data analyses of the NEB results were performed as an efficient method to qualitatively evaluate the energetics of transitions along several specific physical coordinates. The free energy barriers for these transitions were then determined more precisely using the HFB method. Kinetic parameters were estimated from the energy barriers using transition state theory and compared against experimentally determined kinetic parameters. When the calculated energy barriers are calibrated by a simple \"scaling factor\", as have been done in our previous vibrational frequency calculations to explain the ligand frequency shift upon its binding to protein, it is possible to make structural interpretations of several observed enzyme dynamic rates. For example, the nanosecond kinetics observed by fluorescence anisotropy may be assigned to the translational motion of the catalytic loop and microsecond kinetics observed in fluorescence T-jump can be assigned to the loop backbone dihedral angle flipping. Furthermore, we can predict that a Trp354 conformational conversion associated with the loop movements would occur on the tens of nanoseconds time scale, to be verified by future UVRR T-jump studies.","1112":"In the past decade, tuberculosis incidence has declined in much of the world, but has risen in central and South America. It is not yet clear what is driving this reversal of progress in tuberculosis control. Since 2000, the incarcerated population in central and South America has grown by 206%, the greatest increase in the world. Over the same period, notified tuberculosis cases among the incarcerated population (hereinafter termed persons deprived of their liberty [PDL], following the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights) have risen by 269%. In both central and South America, the rise of disease among PDL more than offsets tuberculosis control gains in the general population. Tuberculosis is increasingly concentrated among PDL; currently, 11% of all notified tuberculosis cases in central and South America occur among PDL who comprise less than 1% of the population. The extraordinarily high risk of acquiring tuberculosis within prisons creates a health and human rights crisis for PDL that also undermines wider tuberculosis control efforts. Controlling tuberculosis in this region will require countries to take urgent measures to prioritise the health of PDL.","1113":"Importance Devising control strategies against diseases such as COVID-19 require understanding of contextual social mixing and contact patterns. There has been no standardized multi-site social contact study conducted in workplace settings in the United States that can be used to broadly inform pandemic preparedness policy in these settings.\r\n\r\nObjective The study aimed to characterize the patterns of social contacts and mixing across workplace environments, including on-site or when teleworking.\r\n\r\nDesign This was a cross-sectional non-probability survey that used standardized social contact diaries to collect data. Employees were requested to record their physical and non-physical contacts in a diary over two consecutive days, documented at the end of each day. Employees from each company were enrolled through email and electronic diaries sent as individual links. Data were collected from April to June 2020.\r\n\r\nSetting Two multinational consulting companies and one university administrative department, all located in Georgia, USA.\r\n\r\nParticipants Employees opted into the study by accepting the invitation on a link sent via email.\r\n\r\nMain Outcome The outcome was median number of contacts per person per day. This was stratified by day of data collection, age, sex, race and ethnicity.\r\n\r\nResults Of 3,835 employees approached, 357 (9.3%) completed the first day of contact diary of which 304 completed both days of contact diary. There was a median of 2 contacts (IQR: 1-4, range: 0-21) per respondent on both day one and two. The majority (55%) of contacts involved conversation only, occurred at home (64%), and cumulatively lasted more than 4 hours (38%). Most contacts were repeated, and within same age groups, though participants aged 30-59 years reported substantial inter-generational mixing with children.\r\n\r\nConclusion Participating employees in 3 surveyed workplaces reported few contacts, similar to studies from the UK and China when shelter-in-place orders were in effect during the pandemic. Many contacts were repeated which may limit the spread of infection. Future rounds are planned to assess changes in contact patterns when employees resume work in the office after the lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic.","1114":"To identify weather variables associated with pathogens contributing to infectious conjunctivitis globally.Sample collection and pathogen identification from patients with acute infectious conjunctivitis was performed from 2017 to 2023. We linked pathogens identified from 13 sites across 8 countries with publicly available weather data by geographic coordinates. Mixed effects logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the associations between temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity exposures, and the prevalence of infection types (RNA virus, DNA virus, bacteria, and fungus).498 cases from the United States, India, Nepal, Thailand, Burkina Faso, Niger, Vietnam, and Israel were included in the analysis. 8-day average precipitation (mm) was associated with increased odds of RNA virus infection (odds ratio (OR)=1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12 to 1.93, P=0.01) and decreased odds of DNA infection (OR=0.62, 95% CI: 0.46 to 0.82, P<0.001). Relative humidity (%) was associated with increased odds of RNA virus infections (OR=2.64, 95% CI: 1.51 to 4.61, P<0.001), and fungal infections (OR=2.35, 95% CI: 1.19 to 4.66, P=0.01), but decreased odds of DNA virus (OR=0.58, 95%CI: 0.37 to 0.90, P=0.02) and bacterial infections (OR=0.42, 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.71, P<0.001). Temperature (\u00b0C) was not associated with ocular infections for any pathogen type.This study suggests that weather factors affect pathogens differently. Particularly, humidity and precipitation were predictors for pathogens contributing to conjunctivitis worldwide. Additional work is needed to clarify the effects of shifts in weather and environmental factors on ocular infectious diseases.","1115":"Modern networks are very large in size and also evolve with time. As their sizes grow, the complexity of performing network analysis grows as well. Getting a smaller representation of a temporal network with similar properties will help in various data mining tasks. In this paper, we study the novel problem of getting a smaller diffusion-equivalent representation of a set of time-evolving networks. We first formulate a well-founded and general temporal-network condensation problem based on the so-called systemmatrix of the network. We then propose NETCONDENSE, a scalable and effective algorithm which solves this problem using careful transformations in sub-quadratic running time, and linear space complexities. Our extensive experiments show that we can reduce the size of large real temporal networks (from multiple domains such as social, co-authorship, and email) significantly without much loss of information. We also show the wide-applicability of NETCONDENSE by leveraging it for several tasks: for example, we use it to understand, explore, and visualize the original datasets and to also speed-up algorithms for the influence-maximization and event detection problems on temporal networks.","1116":"Air pollution exposures during training may impact race preformances. We aggregated data on 334 collegiate male track & field athletes from 46 universities across the United States over 2010-2014. Using distributed lag non-linear models, we analyzed the relationship between race time and PM2.5, ozone, and two versions of the Air Quality Index (AQI) exposures up to 21\u00a0days prior to the race. We observed a 12.8 (95% CI: 1.3, 24.2) second and 11.5 (95% CI: 0.8, 22.1) second increase in race times from 21\u00a0days of PM2.5 exposure (10.0 versus 5.0\u00a0\u03bcg\/m3) and ozone exposure (54.9 versus 36.9\u00a0ppm), respectively. Exposure measured by the two-pollutant threshold (PM2.5 and ozone) AQI was not significantly associated with race time; however, the association for summed two-pollutant AQI (PM2.5 plus ozone) was similar to associations observed for the individual pollutants (12.4, 95% CI: 1.8, 23.0\u00a0s). Training and competing at elevated air pollution levels, even at exposures within AQI's good-to-moderate classifications, was associated with slower race times. This work provides an initial characterization of the effect of air pollution on running performance and a justification for why coaches should consider approaches to reduce air pollution exposures while training.","1117":"To develop and internally validate a multivariable predictive model for days with new-onset migraine headaches based on patient self-prediction and exposure to common trigger factors.We recruited adults with episodic migraine through online forums to participate in a 90-day prospective daily-diary cohort study conducted through a custom research application for iPhone. Every evening, participants answered questions about migraine occurrence and potential predictors including stress, sleep, caffeine and alcohol consumption, menstruation, and self-prediction. We developed and estimated multivariable multilevel logistic regression models for the risk of a new-onset migraine day vs a healthy day and internally validated the models using repeated cross-validation.We had 178 participants complete the study and qualify for the primary analysis which included 1870 migraine events. We found that a decrease in caffeine consumption, higher self-predicted probability of headache, a higher level of stress, and times within 2\u00a0days of the onset of menstruation were positively associated with next-day migraine risk. The multivariable model predicted migraine risk only slightly better than chance (within-person C-statistic: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.58).In this study, episodic migraine attacks were not predictable based on self-prediction or on self-reported exposure to common trigger factors. Improvements in accuracy and breadth of data collection are needed to build clinically useful migraine prediction models.Accurate real-time forecasting of one's daily risk of migraine attack could help episodic migraine patients to target preventive medications for susceptible time periods and help decrease the burden of disease. Little is known about the predictive utility of common migraine trigger factors.","1118":"We analyze the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) under an increasing number of vaccinations in Germany. For the spread of SARS-CoV-2 we employ a SIR-type model that accounts for age-dependence and includes realistic contact patterns between age groups. The implementation of NPIs occurs on changed contact patterns, improved isolation, or reduced infectiousness when, e.g., wearing masks. We account for spatial heterogeneity and commuting activities in between regions in Germany, and the testing of commuters is considered as a further NPI. We include the ongoing vaccination process and analyze the effect of the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant, which is considered to be 40%-60% more infectious then the currently dominant B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant. We explore different opening scenarios under the ongoing vaccination process by assuming that local restrictions are either lifted in early July or August with or without continued wearing of masks and testing. Our results indicate that we can counteract the resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 despite the Delta variant with appropriate timing for the relaxation of NPIs. In all cases, however, school children are hit the hardest.","1119":"During outbreaks of high-consequence pathogens, airport screening programs have been deployed to curtail geographic spread of infection. The effectiveness of screening depends on several factors, including pathogen natural history and epidemiology, human behavior, and characteristics of the source epidemic. We developed a mathematical model to understand how these factors combine to influence screening outcomes. We analyzed screening programs for six emerging pathogens in the early and late stages of an epidemic. We show that the effectiveness of different screening tools depends strongly on pathogen natural history and epidemiological features, as well as human factors in implementation and compliance. For pathogens with longer incubation periods, exposure risk detection dominates in growing epidemics, while fever becomes a better target in stable or declining epidemics. For pathogens with short incubation, fever screening drives detection in any epidemic stage. However, even in the most optimistic scenario arrival screening will miss the majority of cases. ","1120":"Data on rotavirus-positive stool specimens among children age <5 years hospitalized with diarrhea in Blantyre, Malawi before (July 1997 - October 2012, n=1765) and after (November 2012 - October 2019, n=934) RV1 introduction were analyzed. Rotavirus G and P genotypes were assigned using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.A rich rotavirus strain diversity circulated throughout the 22-year period; Shannon (H) and Simpson diversity (D) indices did not differ between the pre- and post-vaccine periods (H' p\u2009<\u20090.149: D' p\u2009<\u20090.287). Overall, G1 (n=268\/924; 28.7%), G2 (n=308\/924; 33.0%), G3 (n=72\/924; 7.7%) and G12 (n=109\/924; 11.8%) were the most prevalent genotypes identified following RV1 introduction. The prevalence of G1P[8] and G2P[4] genotypes declined each successive year following RV1 introduction, and were not detected after 2018. Genotype G3 re-emerged and became the predominant genotype from 2017. No evidence of genotype selection was observed seven years post-RV1 introduction.Rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix\u00ae, RV1) has reduced diarrhea-associated hospitalizations and deaths in Malawi. We examined the trends in circulating rotavirus genotypes in Malawi over a 22-year period to assess the impact of RV1 introduction on strain distribution.Rotavirus strain diversity and genotype variation in Malawi is likely driven by natural mechanisms rather than vaccine pressure.","1121":"A number of evolutionary hypotheses can be tested by comparing selective pressures among sets of branches in a phylogenetic tree. When the question of interest is to identify specific sites within genes that may be evolving differently, a common approach is to perform separate analyses on subsets of sequences, and compare parameter estimates in a post hoc fashion. This approach is statistically suboptimal, and not always applicable. Here, we develop a simple extension of a popular fixed effects likelihood method in the context of codon-based evolutionary phylogenetic maximum likelihood testing, Contrast-FEL. It is suitable for identifying individual alignment sites where any among the K \u2265 2 sets of branches in a phylogenetic tree have detectably different \u03c9 ratios, indicative of different selective regimes. Using extensive simulations, we show that Contrast-FEL delivers good power, exceeding 90% for sufficiently large differences, while maintaining tight control over false positive rates, when the model is correctly specified. We conclude by applying Contrast-FEL to data from five previously published studies spanning a diverse range of organisms and focusing on different evolutionary questions.","1122":"A simple computational model was used to explore how people should choose NPI in a non-containment scenario to minimize mortality if mortality risk differs by age.Strong NPI that can be sustained until drugs or vaccines become available are always preferred for preventing infection and mortality. However, if people encounter a worst-case scenario where interventions cannot be sustained, allowing some infections to occur in lower-risk groups might lead to an overall greater reduction in mortality than trying to protect everyone equally.For any emerging pathogen, the preferred approach is to drive it to extinction with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) or suppress its spread until effective drugs or vaccines are available. However, this might not always be possible. If containment is infeasible, the best people can hope for is pathogen transmission until population level immunity is achieved, with as little morbidity and mortality as possible.Results show that strong NPI might be worse overall if they cannot be sustained compared to weaker NPI of the same duration. It was also shown that targeting NPI at different age groups can lead to similar reductions in the total number of infected, but can have strong differences regarding the reduction in mortality.","1123":"In April 2020, we developed a COVID-19 transmission model used as part of RAND's web-based COVID-19 decision support tool that compares the effects of different nonphar-maceutical public health interventions (NPIs) on health and economic outcomes. An interdis-ciplinary approach informed the selection and use of multiple NPIs, combining quantitative modeling of the health\/economic impacts of interventions with qualitative assessments of other important considerations (e.g., cost, ease of implementation, equity). We previously published a description of our approach as a RAND report describing how the epidemiological model, the economic model, and a systematic assessment of NPIs informed the web-tool. This paper provides further details of our model, describes extensions that we made to our model since April, presents sensitivity analyses, and analyzes periodic NPIs. Our findings suggest that there are opportunities to shape the tradeoffs between economic and health outcomes by carefully evaluating a more comprehensive range of reopening policies. We consider strategies that periodically switch between a base NPI level and a higher NPI level as our working example.","1124":"As part of evaluations underway in six DREAMS sites in three countries (Kenya, South Africa and Zimbabwe), we draw on process evaluation data collected from focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and in-depth interviews with beneficiaries, parents\/caregivers, programme managers and opinion leaders. Additionally, structured observations were conducted and Gantt charts completed upon consultation with implementers. We concurrently reviewed documentation available on DREAMS and held cross-site discussions to interpret findings.The 'DREAMS Partnership' promotes a multi-sectoral approach to reduce adolescent girls and young women's (AGYW) vulnerability through a core package of interventions targeting multiple sources of HIV risk-to promote Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored and Safe (DREAMS) lives. Implementation of such multi-sectoral programmes is complex and requires adaptation to national and local contexts. We describe the early implementation of DREAMS in diverse settings, to identify lessons for the scale-up and replication of combination programmes for young people.All sites sought to implement all components of the DREAMS core package, but how and when they were implemented varied by context. Models of delivery differed, with either multiple or single partners responsible for some or all interventions. Key challenges included the urgent and ambitious expectations of DREAMS; 'layering' multiple interventions across different sectors (health, education, social welfare); supporting individuals' journeys between services to improve uptake and retention; engaging communities beyond direct beneficiaries; avoiding perceived\/actual exclusivity; and ensuring continuity of commitment and funding for DREAMS. Despite significant challenges, DREAMS was well-received in the communities and perceived by both beneficiaries and implementers to empower AGYW to remain HIV negative. Structures, protocols and tools were introduced to strengthen referrals and deliver services targeted to the age and circumstances of young people.The benefits of combinations or integrated 'packages' of interventions are increasingly recognised. Early implementation of DREAMS provides useful lessons for improving coordination across multiple partners using a phased, systematic approach, regular adaptions to each unique context, and ensuring community ownership.","1125":"There is debate over the effectiveness of deworming children against soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) to improve health outcomes, and current evidence may be limited in study design and generalizability. However, programmatic deworming continues throughout low and middle-income countries.We performed an empirical evaluation of the relationship between deworming in pre-school age children (ages 1-4 years) within the previous 6 months, as proxy-reported by the mother, and health outcomes of weight, height, and hemoglobin. We used nationally representative cross-sectional data from 45 countries using the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) during the period 2005-2016. We used logistic regression with coarsened exact matching, fixed effects for survey and year, and person-level covariates. We included data on 325,115 children in 45 STH-endemic countries from 66 DHS surveys. Globally in STH-endemic countries, children who received deworming treatment were less likely to be stunted (1.2 percentage point decline from mean of 36%; 95% CI [-1.9, -0.5%]; p<0.001), but we did not detect consistent associations between deworming and anemia or weight. In sub-Saharan Africa, we found that children who received deworming treatment were less likely to be stunted (1.1 percentage point decline from mean of 36%; 95% CI [-2.1, -0.2%]; p = 0.01) and less likely to have anemia (1.8 percentage point decline from mean of 58%; 95% CI [-2.8, -0.7%]; p<0.001), but we did not detect consistent associations between deworming and weight. These findings were robust across multiple statistical models, and we did not find consistently measurable associations with data from non-endemic settings.Among pre-school age children, we detected a robust and consistent association between deworming and reduced stunting, with additional evidence for reduced anemia in sub-Saharan Africa. We did not find a consistent relationship between deworming and improved weight. This global empirical analysis provides evidence to support the deworming of pre-school age children.","1126":"Teen-SPARC is built in Excel for familiarity and ease and parameterized using data from CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. We present teen-SPARC's methods, including derivation of national parameters and instructions to obtain local parameters. We model multiple scenarios of increasing condom use and estimate the impact on gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HIV incidence, comparing national and New York State (NYS) results.Adolescents aged 13-18 years bear a large burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and changing adolescent sexual risk behavior is a key component of reducing this burden. We demonstrate a novel publicly available modeling tool (teen-SPARC) to help state and local health departments predict the impact of behavioral change on gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HIV burden among adolescents.Teen-SPARC may be able to assist health departments aiming to tailor behavioral interventions for STI prevention among adolescents.A 1% annual increase in condom use (consistent with Healthy People 2020 goals) could prevent nearly 10,000 cases of STIs nationwide. Increases in condom use of 17.1%, 2.2%, and 25.5% in NYS would be necessary to avert 1000 cases of gonorrhea, 1000 cases of chlamydia, and 10 cases of HIV infection, respectively. Additional results disaggregate outcomes by age, sex, partner sex, jurisdiction, and pathogen.","1127":"COVID-19 is linked to diabetes, increasing the likelihood and severity of outcomes due to hyperglycemia, immune system impairment, vascular problems, and comorbidities like hypertension, obesity, and cardiovascular disease, which can lead to catastrophic outcomes. The study presents a novel COVID-19 management approach for diabetic patients using a fractal fractional operator and Mittag-Leffler kernel. It uses the Lipschitz criterion and linear growth to identify the solution singularity and analyzes the global derivative impact, confirming unique solutions and demonstrating the bounded nature of the proposed system. The study examines the impact of COVID-19 on individuals with diabetes, using global stability analysis and quantitative examination of equilibrium states. Sensitivity analysis is conducted using reproductive numbers to determine the disease's status in society and the impact of control strategies, highlighting the importance of understanding epidemic problems and their properties. This study uses two-step Lagrange polynomial to analyze the impact of the fractional operator on a proposed model. Numerical simulations using MATLAB validate the effects of COVID-19 on diabetic patients and allow predictions based on the established theoretical framework, supporting the theoretical findings. This study will help to observe and understand how COVID-19 affects people with diabetes. This will help with control plans in the future to lessen the effects of COVID-19.","1128":"There are contrasting results concerning the effect of reactive school closure on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. To shed light on this controversy, we developed a data-driven computational model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We found that by reactively closing classes based on syndromic surveillance, SARS-CoV-2 infections are reduced by no more than 17.3% (95%CI: 8.0-26.8%), due to the low probability of timely identification of infections in the young population. We thus investigated an alternative triggering mechanism based on repeated screening of students using antigen tests. Depending on the contribution of schools to transmission, this strategy can greatly reduce COVID-19 burden even when school contribution to transmission and immunity in the population\u00a0is low. Moving forward, the adoption of antigen-based screenings in schools could be instrumental to limit COVID-19 burden while vaccines continue to\u00a0be rolled out.","1129":" The large number of missing phylogenetic linkages in rural Florida counties and among women and Black persons with HIV may impact timely detection of ongoing and emerging transmission clusters and ultimately hinder the success of epidemic elimination goals in Florida.","1130":"Much of the basic ecology of Ebolavirus remains unresolved despite accumulating disease outbreaks, viral strains and evidence of animal hosts. Because human Ebolavirus epidemics have been linked to contact with wild mammals other than bats, traits shared by species that have been infected by Ebolavirus and their phylogenetic distribution could suggest ecological mechanisms contributing to human Ebolavirus spillovers. We compiled data on Ebolavirus exposure in mammals and corresponding data on life-history traits, movement, and diet, and used boosted regression trees (BRT) to identify predictors of exposure and infection for 119 species (hereafter hosts). Mapping the phylogenetic distribution of presumptive Ebolavirus hosts reveals that they are scattered across several distinct mammal clades, but concentrated among Old World fruit bats, primates and artiodactyls. While sampling effort was the most important predictor, explaining nearly as much of the variation among hosts as traits, BRT models distinguished hosts from all other species with greater than 97% accuracy, and revealed probable Ebolavirus hosts as large-bodied, frugivorous, and with slow life histories. Provisionally, results suggest that some insectivorous bat genera, Old World monkeys and forest antelopes should receive priority in Ebolavirus survey efforts. This article is part of the theme issue 'Dynamic and integrative approaches to understanding pathogen spillover'.","1131":"This study measures associations between COVID-19 deaths and sociodemographic factors (wealth, insurance coverage, urban residence, age, state population) for states in Nigeria across two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic: February 27th 2020 to October 24th 2020 and October 25th 2020 to July 25th 2021. Data sources include 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey and Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) COVID-19 daily reports. It uses negative binomial models to model deaths, and stratifies results by respondent gender. It finds that overall mortality rates were concentrated within three states: Lagos, Edo and Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja. Urban residence and insurance coverage are positively associated with differences in deaths for the full sample. The former, however, is significant only during the early stages of the pandemic. Associative differences in gender-stratified models suggest that wealth was a stronger protective factor for men and insurance a stronger protective factor for women. Associative strength between sociodemographic measures and deaths varies by gender and pandemic wave, suggesting that the pandemic impacted men and women in unique ways, and that the effectiveness of interventions should be evaluated for specific waves or periods.","1132":"The innovations found were classified into two categories: process innovations and technological innovations. The process innovations included six types of innovations: roles, governance, training, policies and protocols, recruitment, and awareness. The technological innovations included three aspects: information and communication; transport; and health technology. The descriptive statistics revealed that innovations such as counselling and support for CFRs (median: 5 IQR 5,5), peer support [5 (4,5)], and enhanced communication with control room [5 (4,5)] were essential priorities. Contrastingly, innovations such as the provision of dual CFR crew [1.5 (1,3)], CFR responsibilities in patient transport to hospital [1 (1,2)], and CFR access to emergency blue light [1 (1,1.5)] were deemed non-priorities.This article established consensus on innovations in the CFR schemes and their ranking for improving the provision of care delivered by CFRs in communities. The consensus-building process also informed policy- and decision-makers on the potential future change agenda for CFR schemes.We conducted a mixed-methods study, adopting a modified nominal group technique with participants from ambulance services, CFR schemes and community stakeholders. The 1-day consensus workshop consisted of four sessions: introduction of innovations derived from primary research; round-robin discussions to generate new ideas; discussion and ranking of innovations; feedback of ranking, re-ranking and concluding statements. Innovations were ranked on a 5-point Likert scale and descriptive statistics of median and interquartile range calculated. Discussions were recorded, transcribed, and analysed thematically.We aimed to achieve consensus among NHS and community stakeholders to identify and prioritise innovations in Community First Responder (CFR) schemes.","1133":"We used data from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study (Baltimore, MD) for this longitudinal analysis. Adaptive and maladaptive coping behavioral constructs were measured using the Brief COPE Inventory at visit 1. We used multiple logistic regression to assess the odds of incident CKD and rapid kidney function decline per point increase in coping scales and adjusted for baseline demographics and clinical variables.Adaptive coping behaviors were associated with lower odds of incident CKD and could represent a target to facilitate CKD prevention. The role of medical care in this association is an area worthy of further investigation.Of 1935 participants, mean age was 48 years, 44% were male, 56% were Black persons, and baseline mean (SD) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 91(16) ml\/min\/1.73m 2 . After a median of 8.2 years, 113 participants developed incident CKD, and 341 had rapid kidney function decline. Compared to those who reported they usually did not use adaptive coping behaviors at all (such as emotional support), those with the highest use of adaptive coping had lower odds of incident CKD. Every 1-unit increase in adaptive coping corresponded with a 2% lower adjusted odds of incident CKD (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.95 to 0.99). There was no association between maladaptive coping behaviors and incident CKD. Coping behaviors were not associated with rapid kidney function decline.How someone copes may alter the trajectory of their kidney function. We aimed to evaluate whether coping behaviors were associated with incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) or rapid kidney function decline.","1134":"An interrupted time-series study design was implemented to evaluate the impact of antibiotic stewardship interventions on antibiotic prescribing among veterinarians. A total of 41 veterinarians were enrolled in Canada and Israel and their prescribing data between 2019 and 2021 were obtained. As an intervention, veterinarians periodically received three feedback reports comprising feedback on the participants' antibiotic prescribing and prescribing guidelines. A change in the level and trend of antibiotic prescribing after the administration of the intervention was compared using a multi-level generalized linear mixed-effect negative-binomial model. After the receipt of the first (incidence rate ratios [IRR] = 0.88; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.79, 0.98), and second (IRR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.97) feedback reports, there was a reduced prescribing rate of total antibiotic when other parameters were held constant. This decline was more pronounced among Israeli veterinarians compared to Canadian veterinarians. When other parameters were held constant, the prescribing of critical antibiotics by Canadian veterinarians decreased by a factor of 0.39 compared to that of Israeli veterinarians. Evidently, antibiotic stewardship interventions can improve antibiotic prescribing in a veterinary setting. The strategy to sustain the effect of feedback reports and the determinants of differences between the two cohorts should be further explored.","1135":"Machine learning improved classification of individuals at risk of HIV acquisition compared to a model-based approach or reliance on known risk groups, and could inform targeting of prevention strategies in generalized epidemic settings.Between 2013-2017, >75% of residents in 16 communities in the SEARCH Study tested annually for HIV. In this population, we evaluated three strategies for using demographic factors to predict the one-year risk of HIV seroconversion: (1) membership in \u22651 known \"Risk Group\" (e.g., young woman or HIV-infected spouse); (2) a \"Model-based\" risk score constructed with logistic regression; (3) a \"Machine Learning\" risk score constructed with the Super Learner algorithm. We hypothesized Machine Learning would identify high-risk individuals more efficiently (fewer persons targeted for a fixed sensitivity) and with higher sensitivity (for a fixed number of persons targeted) than either other approach.In generalized epidemic settings, strategies are needed to prioritize individuals at higher risk of HIV acquisition for prevention services such as pre-exposure prophylaxis. We used population-level HIV testing data from rural Kenya and Uganda to construct HIV risk scores and assessed their ability to identify seroconversions.75,558 HIV-negative persons contributed 166,723 person-years of follow-up; 519 seroconverted. Machine Learning improved efficiency; to achieve a fixed sensitivity of 50%, the Risk Group strategy targeted 42% of the population, Model-based 27%, and Machine Learning 18%. Machine Learning also improved sensitivity; with an upper limit of 45% targeted, the Risk Group strategy correctly classified 58% of seroconversions, Model-based 68%, and Machine Learning 78%.","1136":". Using contact tracing data from 1,038 SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed between 23 January and 28 April 2020 in Hong Kong, we identified and characterized all local clusters of infection. We identified 4-7 SSEs across 51 clusters (n\u2009=\u2009309 cases) and estimated that 19% (95% confidence interval, 15-24%) of cases seeded 80% of all local transmission. Transmission in social settings was associated with more secondary cases than households when controlling for age (P\u2009=\u20090.002). Decreasing the delay between symptom onset and case confirmation did not result in fewer secondary cases (P\u2009=\u20090.98), although the odds that an individual being quarantined as a contact interrupted transmission was 14.4 (95% CI, 1.9-107.2). Public health authorities should focus on rapidly tracing and quarantining contacts, along with implementing restrictions targeting social settings to reduce the risk of SSEs and suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","1137":"Manually analyzing public health-related content from social media provides valuable insights into the beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors of individuals, shedding light on trends and patterns that can inform public understanding, policy decisions, targeted interventions, and communication strategies. Unfortunately, the time and effort needed from well-trained human subject matter experts makes extensive manual social media listening unfeasible. Generative large language models (LLMs) can potentially summarize and interpret large amounts of text, but it is unclear to what extent LLMs can glean subtle health-related meanings in large sets of social media posts and reasonably report health-related themes.We aimed to assess the feasibility of using LLMs for topic model selection or inductive thematic analysis of large contents of social media posts by attempting to answer the following question: Can LLMs conduct topic model selection and inductive thematic analysis as effectively as humans did in a prior manual study, or at least reasonably, as judged by subject matter experts?The LLMs generally gave high rankings to the topics chosen previously by humans as most relevant. We reject a null hypothesis (P<.001, overall comparison) and conclude that these LLMs are more likely to include the human-rated top 5 content areas in their top rankings than would occur by chance. Regarding theme identification, LLMs identified several themes similar to those identified by humans, with very low hallucination rates. Variability occurred between LLMs and between test runs of an individual LLM. Despite not consistently matching the human-generated themes, subject matter experts found themes generated by the LLMs were still reasonable and relevant.LLMs can effectively and efficiently process large social media-based health-related data sets. LLMs can extract themes from such data that human subject matter experts deem reasonable. However, we were unable to show that the LLMs we tested can replicate the depth of analysis from human subject matter experts by consistently extracting the same themes from the same data. There is vast potential, once better validated, for automated LLM-based real-time social listening for common and rare health conditions, informing public health understanding of the public's interests and concerns and determining the public's ideas to address them.We asked the same research question and used the same set of social media content for both the LLM selection of relevant topics and the LLM analysis of themes as was conducted manually in a published study about vaccine rhetoric. We used the results from that study as background for this LLM experiment by comparing the results from the prior manual human analyses with the analyses from 3 LLMs: GPT4-32K, Claude-instant-100K, and Claude-2-100K. We also assessed if multiple LLMs had equivalent ability and assessed the consistency of repeated analysis from each LLM.","1138":"Increased availability of epidemiological data, novel digital data streams, and the rise of powerful machine learning approaches have generated a surge of research activity on real-time epidemic forecast systems. In this paper, we propose the use of a novel data source, namely retail market data to improve seasonal influenza forecasting. Specifically, we consider supermarket retail data as a proxy signal for influenza, through the identification of sentinel baskets, i.e., products bought together by a population of selected customers. We develop a nowcasting and forecasting framework that provides estimates for influenza incidence in Italy up to 4 weeks ahead. We make use of the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model to produce the predictions of seasonal flu incidence. Our predictions outperform both a baseline autoregressive model and a second baseline based on product purchases. The results show quantitatively the value of incorporating retail market data in forecasting models, acting as a proxy that can be used for the real-time analysis of epidemics.","1139":"As disability becomes an increasingly large component of disease burden and a larger component of health expenditure, greater research and development investment is needed to identify new, more effective intervention strategies. With a rapidly ageing global population, the demands on health services to deal with disabling outcomes, which increase with age, will require policy makers to anticipate these changes. The mix of universal and more geographically specific influences on health reinforces the need for regular reporting on population health in detail and by underlying cause to help decision makers to identify success stories of disease control to emulate, as well as opportunities to improve.Global health has steadily improved over the past 30 years as measured by age-standardised DALY rates. After taking into account population growth and ageing, the absolute number of DALYs has remained stable. Since 2010, the pace of decline in global age-standardised DALY rates has accelerated in age groups younger than 50 years compared with the 1990-2010 time period, with the greatest annualised rate of decline occurring in the 0-9-year age group. Six infectious diseases were among the top ten causes of DALYs in children younger than 10 years in 2019: lower respiratory infections (ranked second), diarrhoeal diseases (third), malaria (fifth), meningitis (sixth), whooping cough (ninth), and sexually transmitted infections (which, in this age group, is fully accounted for by congenital syphilis; ranked tenth). In adolescents aged 10-24 years, three injury causes were among the top causes of DALYs: road injuries (ranked first), self-harm (third), and interpersonal violence (fifth). Five of the causes that were in the top ten for ages 10-24 years were also in the top ten in the 25-49-year age group: road injuries (ranked first), HIV\/AIDS (second), low back pain (fourth), headache disorders (fifth), and depressive disorders (sixth). In 2019, ischaemic heart disease and stroke were the top-ranked causes of DALYs in both the 50-74-year and 75-years-and-older age groups. Since 1990, there has been a marked shift towards a greater proportion of burden due to YLDs from non-communicable diseases and injuries. In 2019, there were 11 countries where non-communicable disease and injury YLDs constituted more than half of all disease burden. Decreases in age-standardised DALY rates have accelerated over the past decade in countries at the lower end of the SDI range, while improvements have started to stagnate or even reverse in countries with higher SDI.In an era of shifting global agendas and expanded emphasis on non-communicable diseases and injuries along with communicable diseases, sound evidence on trends by cause at the national level is essential. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) provides a systematic scientific assessment of published, publicly available, and contributed data on incidence, prevalence, and mortality for a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of diseases and injuries.GBD estimates incidence, prevalence, mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 369 diseases and injuries, for two sexes, and for 204 countries and territories. Input data were extracted from censuses, household surveys, civil registration and vital statistics, disease registries, health service use, air pollution monitors, satellite imaging, disease notifications, and other sources. Cause-specific death rates and cause fractions were calculated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression. Cause-specific deaths were adjusted to match the total all-cause deaths calculated as part of the GBD population, fertility, and mortality estimates. Deaths were multiplied by standard life expectancy at each age to calculate YLLs. A Bayesian meta-regression modelling tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, was used to ensure consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, excess mortality, and cause-specific mortality for most causes. Prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights for mutually exclusive sequelae of diseases and injuries to calculate YLDs. We considered results in the context of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and fertility rate in females younger than 25 years. Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for every metric using the 25th and 975th ordered 1000 draw values of the posterior distribution.Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.","1140":"In this paper, a modified SEIR epidemic model incorporating shedding effect is proposed to analyze transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 virus among different individuals' classes. The direct impact of pathogen concentration over susceptible populations through the shedding of COVID-19 virus into the environment is investigated. Moreover, the threshold value of shedding parameters is computed which gives information about their significance in decreasing the impact of the disease. The basic reproduction number ( R0 ) is calculated using the next-generation matrix method, taking shedding as a new infection. In the absence of disease, the condition for the equilibrium point to be locally and globally asymptotically stable with R01 . Bifurcation theory and center manifold theorem imply that the system exhibit backward bifurcation at R0=1 . The sensitivity indices of R0 are computed to investigate the robustness of model parameters. The numerical simulation is demonstrated to illustrate the results.","1141":"The prevalence of tobacco smoking in the general population declined from 7.3% in 2010-2011 to 5.1% in 2016-2018, p<0.001. Smoking rates declined among males (13.9-9.2%) and females (2.2-1.8%) from 2010-2011 to 2016-2018. Smoking prevalence was higher among previously married (11.8-11.7%) compared to currently (8.4-5.3%) and never married persons (3.1-1.8%) from 2010-2011 to 2016-2018. Older age (\u226535 years) was associated with higher odds of smoking (AOR=8.72; 95% CI: 5.68-13.39 in 2010-2011 and AOR=9.03; 95% CI: 5.42-15.06 in 2016-2018) compared to those aged <35 years (AOR=4.73; 95% CI: 3.15-7.12 in 2010-2011 and AOR=4.83; 95% CI: 2.95-7.91 in 2016-2018). Primary and secondary\/higher education level was significantly associated with lower odds of smoking (AOR=0.20; 95% CI: 0.14-0.29 in 2010-2011 and AOR=0.26; 95% CI: 0.18-0.39 in 2016-2018) compared to no education (AOR=0.43; 95% CI: 0.31-0.59 in 2010-2011 and AOR=0.48; 95% CI: 0.34-0.68 in 2016-2018). Number of sexual partners and HIV status were not associated with smoking.Tobacco use is a major public health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where 80% of the world's smokers reside. There is limited population-based data from rural Africa on patterns of tobacco smoking and smoker characteristics. We assessed trends in rates of smoking, characteristics of smokers, and factors associated with smoking using repeat population-based cross-sectional surveys in south-central Uganda. test for trends, and factors associated with smoking were assessed by multivariable logistic regression.We observed declining trends in tobacco smoking in the Rakai region of rural Uganda. Smoking was more prevalent in men, older individuals, individuals who were previously married, and individuals with lower education. The decline in smoking may be due to tobacco control efforts, but there is a continued need to target sub-populations with higher smoking prevalence.","1142":"Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the role of asymptomatic influenza virus infections in influenza transmission was uncertain. However, the importance of asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 for onward transmission of COVID-19 has led experts to question whether the role of asymptomatic influenza virus infections in transmission had been underappreciated. We discuss the existing evidence on the frequency of asymptomatic influenza virus infections, the extent to which they contribute to infection transmission, and remaining knowledge gaps. We propose priority areas for further evaluation, study designs, and case definitions to address existing knowledge gaps.","1143":"The EMOD malaria model was used to predict the impact of PMC with and without RTS,S on clinical and severe malaria cases in children under the age of two years (U2). PMC and RTS,S effect sizes were fit to trial data. PMC was simulated with three to seven doses (PMC-3-7) before the age of eighteen months and RTS,S with three doses, shown to be effective at nine months. Simulations were run for transmission intensities of one to 128 infectious bites per person per year, corresponding to incidences of <\u20091 to 5500 cases per 1000 population U2. Intervention coverage was either set to 80% or based on 2018 household survey data for Southern Nigeria as a sample use case. The protective efficacy (PE) for clinical and severe cases in children U2 was calculated in comparison to no PMC and no RTS,S.PMC can substantially reduce clinical and severe cases in the first two years of life in areas with high malaria burden and perennial transmission. A better understanding of the malaria risk profile by age in early childhood and on feasible coverage by age, is needed for selecting an appropriate PMC schedule in a given setting.The projected impact of PMC or RTS,S was greater at moderate to high transmission than at low or very high transmission. Across the simulated transmission levels, PE estimates of PMC-3 at 80% coverage ranged from 5.7 to 8.8% for clinical, and from 6.1 to 13.6% for severe malaria (PE of RTS,S 10-32% and 24.6-27.5% for clinical and severe malaria, respectively. In children U2, PMC with seven doses nearly averted as many cases as RTS,S, while the combination of both was more impactful than either intervention alone. When operational coverage, as seen in Southern Nigeria, increased to a hypothetical target of 80%, cases were reduced beyond the relative increase in coverage.A recent WHO recommendation for perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC) encourages countries to adapt dose timing and number to local conditions. However, knowledge gaps on the epidemiological impact of PMC and possible combination with the malaria vaccine RTS,S hinder informed policy decisions in countries where malaria burden in young children remains high.","1144":" appears to be able to infect about half of amphibian taxa and sites, there is considerable room for biosecurity actions to forestall its spread using both bottom-up community-run efforts and top-down national-to-international policies.

This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT01188018.Motivational Interviewing (MI), Brief Advice (BA) and Health Education (HE) are established smoking cessation induction methods for smokers with low desire to quit. Although randomized controlled trials (RCT's) have been frequently used to assess these interventions the temporal efficacy and effectiveness of these interventions have been poorly elaborated. The present work endeavors to fill the gap by considering the full range of possible motivational outcomes for all of the participants.The methodology proposed in this paper strongly benefits from the capabilities of both MC and ODE modeling approaches, in the event of low observations over the time. Particularly, the temporal population sizes are first estimated by the MC model. Then they are used to parametrize the ODE model and predict future values. The methodology enabes us to determine and compare the temporal efficacy and effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions, yielding predictive and analytic insights related to temporal characteristics and capabilities of these interventions during the study period and beyond.As a two-step process, Markov Chain (MC) and Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) models were successively employed to examine the temporal efficacy and effectiveness of these interventions by computing the gradual movements of participants from an initial stage of unmotivated smoker to stages of increased motivation to quit and cessation. Specifically, in our re-analysis of data from the RCT we examined the proportion of participants in 4 stages of readiness to quit (unmotivated, undecided, motivated, former smokers) over 6\u00a0months, across treatment groups [MI (n\u2009=\u200987), BA (n\u2009=\u200943) and HE (n\u2009=\u200991)].Although HE had greater efficacy compared to MI and BA (i.e., the highest smoking cessation rates), it had lower effectiveness at certain time points. This was due to the fact that HE had the greatest proportion of motivated smokers who quit smoking but simultaneously a large proportion of the motivated smokers became unmotivated to quit. The effectiveness of HE dropped substantially in weeks 3-12 and remained below the effectiveness of BA from week 12 onward. The 2-year ODE model projections show that the prevalence of motivated smokers in HE group may fall below 5%. The prevalence of HE former smokers can reach an equilibrium of 26%, where the prevalence of both BA and MI former smokers exceeds this equilibrium.","1146":"Quantifying the temporal dynamics of infectiousness of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for understanding the spread of COVID-19 and for evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. Many studies have estimated the infectiousness profile using observed serial intervals. However, statistical and epidemiological biases could lead to underestimation of the duration of infectiousness. We correct for these biases by curating data from the initial outbreak of the pandemic in China (when mitigation was minimal), and find that the infectiousness profile of the original strain is longer than previously thought. Sensitivity analysis shows our results are robust to model structure, assumed growth rate and potential observational biases. Although unmitigated transmission data is lacking for variants of concern (VOC), previous analyses suggest that the alpha and delta variants have faster within-host kinetics, which we extrapolate to crude estimates of variant-specific unmitigated generation intervals. Knowing the unmitigated infectiousness profile of infected individuals can inform estimates of the effectiveness of isolation and quarantine measures. The framework presented here can help design better quarantine policies in early stages of future epidemics.","1147":" nor Lipschitz continuous suggesting that numerical approaches to this family of dynamic infectious disease models may not be computationally stable. Furthermore, we demonstrate that relaxing the standard assumption of constant disease transmission rate can fundamentally change the shape of the action region, add a singular arc to the optimal control, and make preserving the drug for a serious outbreak optimal. In addition, we apply our framework to the case of antibiotic resistant gonorrhea.","1148":"Culex pipiens mosquito is a species widely spread across Europe and represents a competent vector for many arboviruses such as West Nile virus (WNV), which has been recently circulating in many European countries, causing hundreds of human cases. In order to identify the main determinants of the high heterogeneity in Cx. pipiens abundance observed in Piedmont region (Northwestern Italy) among different seasons, we developed a density-dependent stochastic model that takes explicitly into account the role played by temperature, which affects both developmental and mortality rates of different life stages. The model was calibrated with a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach exploring the likelihood of recorded capture data gathered in the study area from 2000 to 2011; in this way, we disentangled the role played by different seasonal eco-climatic factors in shaping the vector abundance. Illustrative simulations have been performed to forecast likely changes if temperature or density-dependent inputs would change. Our analysis suggests that inter-seasonal differences in the mosquito dynamics are largely driven by different temporal patterns of temperature and seasonal-specific larval carrying capacities. Specifically, high temperatures during early spring hasten the onset of the breeding season and increase population abundance in that period, while, high temperatures during the summer can decrease population size by increasing adult mortality. Higher densities of adult mosquitoes are associated with higher larval carrying capacities, which are positively correlated with spring precipitations. Finally, an increase in larval carrying capacity is expected to proportionally increase adult mosquito abundance.","1149":"Abundance-occupancy relationships predict that species that occupy more sites are also more locally abundant, where occupancy is usually estimated following the assumption that species can occupy all sampled sites. Here we use the National Ecological Observatory Network small-mammal data to assess whether this assumption affects abundance-occupancy relationships. We estimated occupancy considering all sampled sites (traditional occupancy) and only the sites found within the species geographic range (spatial occupancy) and realized environmental niche (environmental occupancy). We found that when occupancy was estimated considering only sites possible for the species to colonize (spatial and environmental occupancy) weaker abundance-occupancy relationships were observed. This shows that the assumption that the species can occupy all sampled sites directly affects the assessment of abundance-occupancy relationships. Estimating occupancy considering only sites that are possible for the species to colonize will consequently lead to a more robust assessment of abundance-occupancy relationships.","1150":"Tanzania has made remarkable progress in reducing malaria burden and aims to transition from malaria control to sub-national elimination. In 2013, electronic weekly and monthly reporting platforms using the District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2) were introduced. Weekly reporting was implemented through the mobile phone-based Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (eIDSR) platform and progressively scaled-up from 67 to 7471 (100%) public and private health facilities between 2013 and 2020. This study describes the roll-out and large-scale implementation of eIDSR and compares the consistency between weekly eIDSR and monthly DHIS2 malaria indicator data reporting, including an assessment of its usefulness for malaria outbreak detection and case-based surveillance (CBS) in low transmission areas.The concurrence of annualized weekly eIDSR and monthly DHIS2 reporting completeness, malaria cases and incidence in very low strata suggests that eIDSR could be useful tool for early outbreak detection, and the eIDSR platform could reliably be expanded by adding more indicators and modules for CBS in the very low epidemiological stratum.The indicators included in the analysis were number of patients tested for malaria, number of confirmed malaria cases, and clinical cases (treated presumptively for malaria). The analysis described the time trends of reporting, testing, test positivity, and malaria cases between 2013 and 2021. For both weekly eIDSR and monthly DHIS2 data, comparisons of annual reporting completeness, malaria cases and annualized incidence were performed for 2020 and 2021; additionally, comparisons were stratified by malaria epidemiological strata (parasite prevalence: very low\u2009\u200930%).Weekly eIDSR reporting completeness steadily improved over time, with completeness being 90.2% in 2020 and 93.9% in 2021; conversely, monthly DHIS2 reporting completeness was 98.9% and 98.7% in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Weekly eIDSR reporting completeness and timeliness were highest in the very low epidemiological stratum. Annualized malaria incidence as reported by weekly eIDSR was 17.5% and 12.4% lower than reported by monthly DHIS2 in 2020 and 2021; for both 2020 and 2021, annualized incidence was similar across weekly and monthly data in the very low stratum.","1151":"Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the performance of tasks by machines ordinarily associated with human intelligence. Machine learning (ML) is a subtype of AI; it refers to the ability of computers to draw conclusions (ie, learn) from data without being directly programmed.

This review provides an overview of ML in healthcare epidemiology and practical examples of ML tools used to support healthcare decision making at 4\u00a0stages of hospital-based care: triage, diagnosis, treatment, and discharge. Examples include model-building efforts to assist emergency department triage, predicting time before septic shock onset, detecting community-acquired pneumonia, and classifying COVID-19 disposition risk level. Increasing availability and quality of electronic health record (EHR) data as well as computing power provides opportunities for ML to increase patient safety, improve the efficiency of clinical management, and reduce healthcare costs.","1152":"These results provide unprecedented insight into the very high transmission potential of dengue and chikungunya in Chennai and underscore the need for enhanced surveillance and control methods.We conducted a household-based seroprevalence survey among 1010 individuals aged 5-40 years living in fifty randomly selected spatial locations in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Participants were asked to provide a venous blood sample and to complete a brief questionnaire with basic demographic and daily activity information. Previous exposure to dengue and chikungunya was determined using IgG indirect ELISA (Panbio) and IgG ELISA (Novatec), respectively. We used this data to estimate key transmission parameters (force of infection and basic reproductive number) and to explore factors associated with seropositivity. While only 1% of participants reported history of dengue and 20% of chikungunya, we found that 93% (95%CI 89-95%) of participants were seropositive to dengue virus, and 44% (95%CI 37-50%) to chikungunya. Age-specific seroprevalence was consistent with long-tem, endemic circulation of dengue and suggestive of epidemic chikungunya transmission. Seropositivity to dengue and chikungunya were significantly correlated, even after adjusting for individual and household factors. We estimate that 23% of the susceptible population gets infected by dengue each year, corresponding to approximately 228,000 infections. This transmission intensity is significantly higher than that estimated in known hyperendemic settings in Southeast Asia and the Americas.Dengue and chikungunya are rapidly expanding viruses transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes. Few epidemiological studies have examined the extent of transmission of these infections in South India despite an increase in the number of reported cases, and a high suitability for transmission.","1153":"Early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office recognised the importance of epidemiological modelling to forecast the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic to support decisions guiding the implementation of response measures. We established a modelling support team to facilitate the application of epidemiological modelling analyses in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) countries. Here, we present an innovative, stepwise approach to participatory modelling of the COVID-19 pandemic that engaged decision-makers and public health professionals from countries throughout all stages of the modelling process. Our approach consisted of first identifying the relevant policy questions, collecting country-specific data and interpreting model findings from a decision-maker's perspective, as well as communicating model uncertainty. We used a simple modelling methodology that was adaptable to the shortage of epidemiological data, and the limited modelling capacity, in our region. We discuss the benefits of using models to produce rapid decision-making guidance for COVID-19 control in the WHO EMR, as well as challenges that we have experienced regarding conveying uncertainty associated with model results, synthesising and comparing results across multiple modelling approaches, and modelling fragile and conflict-affected states.","1154":"Based on parameter estimates from the literature the reproductive number ([Formula: see text]) for the fomite route for rhinovirus and norovirus is greater than 1 in nearly all venues considered, suggesting that this route can sustain transmission. For influenza, on the other hand, [Formula: see text] for the fomite route is smaller suggesting many conditions in which the pathway may not sustain transmission. Additionally, the direct fomite route is more relevant than the hand-fomite route for influenza and rhinovirus, compared to norovirus. The relative importance of the hand-fomite vs. direct fomite route for norovirus is strongly dependent on the fraction of pathogens initially shed to hands. Sensitivity analysis stresses the need for accurate measurements of environmental inactivation rates, transfer efficiencies, and pathogen shedding.We developed and analyzed a compartmental model that explicitly accounts for fomite transmission by including pathogen transfer between hands and surfaces. We consider two sub-types of fomite-mediated transmission: direct fomite (e.g., shedding onto fomites) and hand-fomite (e.g., shedding onto hands and then contacting fomites). We use this model to examine three pathogens with distinct environmental characteristics (influenza, rhinovirus, and norovirus) in four venue types. To parameterize the model for each pathogen we conducted a thorough literature search.Fomite-mediated transmission is an important pathway for the three pathogens examined. The effectiveness of environmental interventions differs significantly both by pathogen and venue. While fomite-based interventions may be able to lower [Formula: see text] for fomites below 1 and interrupt transmission, rhinovirus and norovirus are so infectious ([Formula: see text]) that single environmental interventions are unlikely to interrupt fomite transmission for these pathogens.Fomite mediated transmission can be an important pathway causing significant disease transmission in number of settings such as schools, daycare centers, and long-term care facilities. The importance of these pathways relative to other transmission pathways such as direct person-person or airborne will depend on the characteristics of the particular pathogen and the venue in which transmission occurs. Here we analyze fomite mediated transmission through a comparative analysis across multiple pathogens and venues.","1155":"Creating statistical models that generate accurate predictions of infectious disease incidence is a challenging problem whose solution could benefit public health decision makers. We develop a new approach to this problem using kernel conditional density estimation (KCDE) and copulas. We obtain predictive distributions for incidence in individual weeks using KCDE and tie those distributions together into joint distributions using copulas. This strategy enables us to create predictions for the timing of and incidence in the peak week of the season. Our implementation of KCDE incorporates 2 novel kernel components: a periodic component that captures seasonality in disease incidence and a component that allows for a full parameterization of the bandwidth matrix with discrete variables. We demonstrate via simulation that a fully parameterized bandwidth matrix can be beneficial for estimating conditional densities. We apply the method to predicting dengue fever and influenza and compare to a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model and HHH4, a previously published extension to the generalized linear model framework developed for infectious disease incidence. The KCDE outperforms the baseline methods for predictions of dengue incidence in individual weeks. The KCDE also offers more consistent performance than the baseline models for predictions of incidence in the peak week and is comparable to the baseline models on the other prediction targets. Using the periodic kernel function led to better predictions of incidence. Our approach and extensions of it could yield improved predictions for public health decision makers, particularly in diseases with heterogeneous seasonal dynamics such as dengue fever.","1156":"A number of issues present challenges to the scope and accuracy of current GBD estimates for EH risk factors. For air pollution, minimal data exist on the exposure-risk relationships associated with high levels of pollution; epidemiological studies in high pollution regions should be a research priority. For lead, the GBD's current methods do not fully account for lead's impact on neurodevelopment; innovative methods to account for subclinical effects are needed. Decisions on inclusion of additional EH risk-outcome pairs need to be guided by findings of systematic reviews, the size of exposed populations, feasibility of global exposure estimates, and predicted trends in exposures and diseases. Neurotoxicants, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and climate-related factors should be high priorities for incorporation into upcoming iterations of the GBD study. Enhancing the scope and methods will improve the GBD's estimates and better guide prevention policy. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1289\/EHP5496.We discuss strategies for improving GBD quantification of specific EH risk factors, including air pollution, lead, and climate change. We highlight key methodological challenges, including new EH risk factors, notably evidence rating and global exposure assessment.The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, coordinated by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), produces influential, data-driven estimates of the burden of disease and premature death due to major risk factors. Expanded quantification of disease due to environmental health (EH) risk factors, including climate change, will enhance accuracy of GBD estimates, which will contribute to developing cost-effective policies that promote prevention and achieving Sustainable Development Goals.We review key aspects of the GBD for the EH community and introduce the Global Burden of Disease-Pollution and Health Initiative (GBD-PHI), which aims to work with IHME and the GBD study to improve estimates of disease burden attributable to EH risk factors and to develop an innovative approach to estimating climate-related disease burden-both current and projected.","1157":"Increased risk of infectious disease is assumed to be a major cost of group living, yet empirical evidence for this effect is mixed. We studied whether larger social groups are more subdivided structurally. If so, the social subdivisions that form in larger groups may act as barriers to the spread of infection, weakening the association between group size and infectious disease. To investigate this 'social bottleneck' hypothesis, we examined the association between group size and four network structure metrics in 43 vertebrate and invertebrate species. We focused on metrics involving modularity, clustering, distance and centralization. In a meta-analysis of intraspecific variation in social networks, modularity showed positive associations with network size, with a weaker but still positive effect in cross-species analyses. Network distance also showed a positive association with group size when using intraspecific variation. We then used a theoretical model to explore the effects of subgrouping relative to other effects that influence disease spread in socially structured populations. Outbreaks reached higher prevalence when groups were larger, but subgrouping reduced prevalence. Subgrouping also acted as a 'brake' on disease spread between groups. We suggest research directions to understand the conditions under which larger groups become more subdivided, and to devise new metrics that account for subgrouping when investigating the links between sociality and infectious disease risk. ","1158":"Using descriptive statistics and Kaplan-Meyer curves we analyzed case reporting delays (the period between the date of symptom onset and the date of notification to the public health authorities) during the 2017 Italian chikungunya outbreak. We further investigated the effect of outbreak detection on reporting delays by means of a Cox proportional hazard model. We estimated that the overall median reporting delay was 15.5 days, but this was reduced to 8 days after the notification of the first case. Cases with symptom onset after outbreak detection had about a 3.5 times higher reporting rate, however only 3.6% were notified within 24h from symptom onset. Remarkably, we found that 45.9% of identified cases developed symptoms before the detection of the outbreak.These results suggest that efforts should be undertaken to improve the early detection and identification of arboviral cases, as well as the management of vector species to mitigate the impact of long reporting delays.Emerging arboviral diseases in Europe pose a challenge due to difficulties in detecting and diagnosing cases during the initial circulation of the pathogen. Early outbreak detection enables public health authorities to take effective actions to reduce disease transmission. Quantification of the reporting delays of cases is vital to plan and assess surveillance and control strategies. Here, we provide estimates of reporting delays during an emerging arboviral outbreak and indications on how delays may have impacted onward transmission.","1159":"Human sleeping quarters (domiciles) and chicken coops are key source habitats of Triatoma infestans\u0097the principal vector of the infection that causes Chagas disease\u0097in rural communities in northern Argentina. Here we investigated the links among individual bug bloodmeal contents (BMC, mg), female fecundity, body length (L, mm), host blood sources and habitats. We tested whether L, habitat and host blood conferred relative fitness advantages using generalized linear mixed-effects models and a multimodel inference approach with model averaging. The data analyzed include 769 late-stage triatomines collected in 120 sites from six habitats in 87 houses in Figueroa, Santiago del Estero, during austral spring. L correlated positively with other body-size surrogates and was modified by habitat type, bug stage and recent feeding. Bugs from chicken coops were significantly larger than pig-corral and kitchen bugs. The best-fitting model of log BMC included habitat, a recent feeding, bug stage, log Lc (mean-centered log L) and all two-way interactions including log Lc. Human- and chicken-fed bugs had significantly larger BMC than bugs fed on other hosts whereas goat-fed bugs ranked last, in consistency with average blood-feeding rates. Fecundity was maximal in chicken-fed bugs from chicken coops, submaximal in human- and pig-fed bugs, and minimal in goat-fed bugs. This study is the first to reveal the allometric effects of body-size surrogates on BMC and female fecundity in a large set of triatomine populations occupying multiple habitats, and discloses the links between body size, microsite temperatures and various fitness components that affect the risks of transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi.","1160":": In ABM, the universal vaccine with a conservative VE estimate given once to 18 to 49-year-olds reduced influenza cases among all age groups in Years 2-4 following its introduction. Reduced influenza burden may occur sooner if VE of universal vaccines exceeds that assumed in these models.","1161":"Important barriers for widespread use of health information exchange (HIE) are usability and interface issues. However, most HIEs are implemented without performing a needs assessment with the end users, healthcare providers. We performed a user needs assessment for the process of obtaining clinical information from other health care organizations about a hospitalized patient and identified the types of information most valued for medical decision-making.Quantitative and qualitative analysis were used to evaluate the process to obtain and use outside clinical information (OI) using semi-structured interviews (16 internists), direct observation (750\u00a0h), and operational data from the electronic medical records (30,461 hospitalizations) of an internal medicine department in a public, teaching hospital in Tampa, Florida.Although hospitalists are challenged by a complex process to obtain OI, they recognize the value of specific information for enhancing medical decision-making. HIE systems are likely to have increased utilization and effectiveness if specific patient-level clinical information is delivered at the right time to the right users.13.7\u00a0% of hospitalizations generate at least one request for OI. On average, the process comprised 13 steps, 6 decisions points, and 4 different participants. Physicians estimate that the average time to receive OI is 18\u00a0h. Physicians perceived that OI received is not useful 33-66\u00a0% of the time because information received is irrelevant or not timely. Technical barriers to OI use included poor accessibility and ineffective information visualization. Common problems with the process were receiving extraneous notes and the need to re-request the information. Drivers for OI use were to trend lab or imaging abnormalities, understand medical history of critically ill or hospital-to-hospital transferred patients, and assess previous echocardiograms and bacterial cultures. About 85\u00a0% of the physicians believe HIE would have a positive effect on improving healthcare delivery.","1162":"The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged authorities at different levels of government administration around the globe. When faced with diseases of this severity, it is useful for the authorities to have prediction tools to estimate in advance the impact on the health system as well as the human, material, and economic resources that will be necessary. In this paper, we construct an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model that incorporates the social structure of Mar del Plata, the 4\u00b0most inhabited city in Argentina and head of the Municipality of General Pueyrred\u00f3n. Moreover, we consider detailed partitions of infected individuals according to the illness severity, as well as data of local health resources, to bring predictions closer to the local reality. Tuning the corresponding epidemic parameters for COVID-19, we study an alternating quarantine strategy: a part of the population can circulate without restrictions at any time, while the rest is equally divided into two groups and goes on successive periods of normal activity and lockdown, each one with a duration of \u03c4 days. We also implement a random testing strategy with a threshold over the population. We found that \u03c4=7 is a good choice for the quarantine strategy since it reduces the infected population and, conveniently, it suits a weekly schedule. Focusing on the health system, projecting from the situation as of September 30, we foresee a difficulty to avoid saturation of the available ICU, given the extremely low levels of mobility that would be required. In the worst case, our model estimates that four thousand deaths would occur, of which 30% could be avoided with proper medical attention. Nonetheless, we found that aggressive testing would allow an increase in the percentage of people that can circulate without restrictions, and the medical facilities to deal with the additional critical patients would be relatively low.","1163":"Reciprocal, intimate relationships between the human microbiome and the host immune system are shaped by past microbial encounters and prepare the host for future ones. Antibiotics and other antimicrobials leave their mark on both the microbiome and host immunity. Antimicrobials alter the structure of the microbiota, expand the host-specific pool of antimicrobial-resistance genes and organisms, degrade the protective effects of the microbiota against invasion by pathogens, and may impair vaccine efficacy. Through these effects on the microbiome they may affect immune responses. Vaccines that exert protective or therapeutic effects against pathogens may reduce the use of antimicrobials, the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance, and the harmful impacts of these drugs on the microbiome. Other strategies involving manipulation of the microbiome to deplete antibiotic-resistant organisms or to enhance immune responses to vaccines may prove valuable in addressing antimicrobial resistance as well. This article describes the intersections of immunity, microbiome and antimicrobial exposure, and the use of vaccines and other alternative strategies for the control and management of antimicrobial resistance.","1164":"Across many scientific domains, there is a common need to automatically extract a simplified view or coarse-graining of how a complex system's components interact. This general task is called community detection in networks and is analogous to searching for clusters in independent vector data. It is common to evaluate the performance of community detection algorithms by their ability to find so-called ground truth communities. This works well in synthetic networks with planted communities because these networks' links are formed explicitly based on those known communities. However, there are no planted communities in real-world networks. Instead, it is standard practice to treat some observed discrete-valued node attributes, or metadata, as ground truth. We show that metadata are not the same as ground truth and that treating them as such induces severe theoretical and practical problems. We prove that no algorithm can uniquely solve community detection, and we prove a general No Free Lunch theorem for community detection, which implies that there can be no algorithm that is optimal for all possible community detection tasks. However, community detection remains a powerful tool and node metadata still have value, so a careful exploration of their relationship with network structure can yield insights of genuine worth. We illustrate this point by introducing two statistical techniques that can quantify the relationship between metadata and community structure for a broad class of models. We demonstrate these techniques using both synthetic and real-world networks, and for multiple types of metadata and community structures.","1165":"Our proposed workflow may prove useful in the design of scalable approaches for real-time predictive systems in ICU environments, exploiting real-time vital sign information from bedside monitors. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT02184208.).Bedside monitors in the ICU routinely measure and collect patients' physiologic data in real time to continuously assess the health status of patients who are critically ill. With the advent of increased computational power and the ability to store and rapidly process big data sets in recent years, these physiologic data show promise in identifying specific outcomes and\/or events during patients' ICU hospitalization.We introduced a methodology designed to automatically extract information from continuous-in-time vital sign data collected from bedside monitors to predict if a patient will experience a prolonged stay (length of stay) on mechanical ventilation, defined as >4 d, in a pediatric ICU.Continuous-in-time vital signs information and clinical history data were retrospectively collected for 284 ICU subjects from their first 24 h on mechanical ventilation from a medical-surgical pediatric ICU at Boston Children's Hospital. Multiple machine learning models were trained on multiple subsets of these subjects to predict the likelihood that each of these subjects would experience a long stay. We evaluated the predictive power of our models strictly on unseen hold-out validation sets of subjects. Our methodology achieved model performance of >83% (area under the curve) by using only vital sign information as input, and performances of 90% (area under the curve) by combining vital sign information with subjects' static clinical data readily available in electronic health records. We implemented this approach on 300 independently trained experiments with different choices of training and hold-out validation sets to ensure the consistency and robustness of our results in our study sample. The predictive power of our approach outperformed recent efforts that used deep learning to predict a similar task.","1166":"On January 23, 2020, China quarantined Wuhan to contain an emerging coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Here, we estimate the probability of 2019-nCoV importations from Wuhan to 369 cities throughout China before the quarantine. The expected risk exceeds 50% in 128 [95% CI 75 186] cities, including five large cities with no reported cases by January 26th.","1167":"Here, we report two complete genome sequences of human adenovirus 55 (HAdV-55) isolates, from a patient in Pennsylvania in 2006 and a U.S. military member in South Korea in 2019. The findings demonstrate the continued global transmission of HAdV-55 viruses in both military and civilian populations.","1168":"Zika virus (ZIKV) caused explosive epidemics across the Americas, starting in Brazil in 2015, and has been associated with severe manifestations such as microcephaly in babies born to infected mothers and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults. As the underlying mechanisms of pathogenesis remain largely unknown, diverse investigations have focused on a potential role for flavivirus cross-reactive antibodies in enhancing ZIKV infection. Antibody-dependent enhancement is especially concerning due to structural similarities between ZIKV and other flaviviruses, especially dengue virus (DENV), that co-circulate in areas affected by ZIKV. Conversely, investigating cross-neutralizing antibodies is important for understanding protection among flaviviruses, including ZIKV. In this review, we discuss the latest findings regarding ZIKV-induced adaptive immunity, such as monoclonal and polyclonal antibody responses, structural immunology, and T cell-mediated responses. Much progress has been made in a short amount of time, but many questions remain. Fully understanding the specificity, magnitude, and kinetics of B cell\/antibody and T cell responses in ZIKV-infected individuals with or without prior exposure to flaviviruses is of great relevance for diagnostics and vaccine development.","1169":"People of different racial\/ethnic backgrounds, demographics, health, and socioeconomic characteristics have experienced disproportionate rates of infection and death due to COVID-19. This study tests if and how county-level rates of infection and death have changed in relation to societal county characteristics through time as the pandemic progressed. This longitudinal study sampled monthly county-level COVID-19 case and death data per 100,000 residents from April 2020 to March 2022, and studied the relationships of these variables with racial\/ethnic, demographic, health, and socioeconomic characteristics for 3125 or 97.0% of U.S. counties, accounting for 96.4% of the U.S. population. The association of all county-level characteristics with COVID-19 case and death rates changed significantly through time, and showed different patterns. For example, counties with higher population proportions of Black, Native American, foreign-born non-citizen, elderly residents, households in poverty, or higher income inequality suffered disproportionately higher COVID-19 case and death rates at the beginning of the pandemic, followed by reversed, attenuated or fluctuating patterns, depending on the variable. Patterns for counties with higher White versus Black population proportions showed somewhat inverse patterns. Counties with higher female population proportions initially had lower case rates but higher death rates, and case and death rates become more coupled and fluctuated later in the pandemic. Counties with higher population densities had fluctuating case and death rates, with peaks coinciding with new variants of COVID-19. Counties with a greater proportion of university-educated residents had lower case and death rates throughout the pandemic, although the strength of this relationship fluctuated through time. This research clearly shows that how different segments of society are affected by a pandemic changes through time. Therefore, targeted policies and interventions that change as a pandemic unfolds are necessary to mitigate its disproportionate effects on vulnerable populations, particularly during the first six months of a pandemic.","1170":"In this paper, we show that solutions to ordinary differential equations describing the large-population limits of Markovian stochastic epidemic models can be interpreted as survival or cumulative hazard functions when analysing data on individuals sampled from the population. We refer to the individual-level survival and hazard functions derived from population-level equations as a survival dynamical system (SDS). To illustrate how population-level dynamics imply probability laws for individual-level infection and recovery times that can be used for statistical inference, we show numerical examples based on synthetic data. In these examples, we show that an SDS analysis compares favourably with a complete-data maximum-likelihood analysis. Finally, we use the SDS approach to analyse data from a 2009 influenza A(H1N1) outbreak at Washington State University.","1171":"We used our framework to propose explanation displays for predictions from a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in-hospital mortality risk model. Proposed displays were based on a model-agnostic, instance-level explanation approach based on feature influence, as determined by Shapley values. Focus group sessions solicited critical care provider feedback on the proposed displays, which were then revised accordingly.The proposed displays were perceived as useful tools in assessing model predictions. However, specific explanation goals and information needs varied by clinical role and level of predictive modeling knowledge. Providers preferred explanation displays that required less information processing effort and could support the information needs of a variety of users. Providing supporting information to assist in interpretation was seen as critical for fostering provider understanding and acceptance of the predictions and explanations. The user-centered explanation display for the PICU in-hospital mortality risk model incorporated elements from the initial displays along with enhancements suggested by providers.We proposed a framework for the design of user-centered displays of explanations for ML models. We used the proposed framework to motivate the design of a user-centered display of an explanation for predictions from a PICU in-hospital mortality risk model. Positive feedback from focus group participants provides preliminary support for the use of model-agnostic, instance-level explanations of feature influence as an approach to understand ML model predictions in healthcare and advances the discussion on how to effectively communicate ML model information to healthcare providers.There is an increasing interest in clinical prediction tools that can achieve high prediction accuracy and provide explanations of the factors leading to increased risk of adverse outcomes. However, approaches to explaining complex machine learning (ML) models are rarely informed by end-user needs and user evaluations of model interpretability are lacking in the healthcare domain. We used extended revisions of previously-published theoretical frameworks to propose a framework for the design of user-centered displays of explanations. This new framework served as the basis for qualitative inquiries and design review sessions with critical care nurses and physicians that informed the design of a user-centered explanation display for an ML-based prediction tool.","1172":"Vector control has been a key component in the fight against malaria for decades, and chemical insecticides are critical to the success of vector control programs worldwide. However, increasing resistance to insecticides threatens to undermine these efforts. Understanding the evolution and propagation of resistance is thus imperative to mitigating loss of intervention effectiveness. Additionally, accelerated research and development of new tools that can be deployed alongside existing vector control strategies is key to eradicating malaria in the near future. Methods such as gene drives that aim to genetically modify large mosquito populations in the wild to either render them refractory to malaria or impair their reproduction may prove invaluable tools. Mathematical models of gene flow in populations, which is the transfer of genetic information from one population to another through migration, can offer invaluable insight into the behavior and potential impact of gene drives as well as the spread of insecticide resistance in the wild. Here, we present the first multi-locus, agent-based model of vector genetics that accounts for mutations and a many-to-many mapping cardinality of genotypes to phenotypes to investigate gene flow, and the propagation of gene drives in Anopheline populations. This model is embedded within a large scale individual-based model of malaria transmission representative of a high burden, high transmission setting characteristic of the Sahel. Results are presented for the selection of insecticide-resistant vectors and the spread of resistance through repeated deployment of insecticide treated nets (ITNs), in addition to scenarios where gene drives act in concert with existing vector control tools such as ITNs. The roles of seasonality, spatial distribution of vector habitat and feed sites, and existing vector control in propagating alleles that confer phenotypic traits via gene drives that result in reduced transmission are explored. The ability to model a spectrum of vector species with different genotypes and phenotypes in the context of malaria transmission allows us to test deployment strategies for existing interventions that reduce the deleterious effects of resistance and allows exploration of the impact of new tools being proposed or developed.","1173":"Erythropoisis stimulating agent (ESA) use was addressed in Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Oncology Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC) meetings between 2004 and 2008. FDA safety-focused regulatory actions occurred in 2007 and 2008. In 2007, black box warnings advised of early death and venous thromboembolism (VTE) risks with ESAs in oncology. In 2010, a Risk Evaluation Strategies (REMS) was initiated, with cancer patient consent that mortality and VTE risks were noted with ESAs. We report warnings and REMS impacts on ESA utilization among Veterans Administration (VA) cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA). Data were from Veterans Affairs database (2003-2012). Epoetin and darbepoetin use were primary outcomes. Segmented linear regression was used to estimate changes in ESA use levels and trends, clinical appropriateness, and adverse events (VTEs) among chemotherapy-treated cancer patients. To estimate changes in level of drug prescription rate after policy actions, model-specific indicator variables as covariates based on specific actions were included. ESA use fell by 95% and 90% from 2005, for epoetin and darbepoetin, from 22% and 11%, respectively, to 1% and 1%, respectively, among cancer patients with CIA, respectively (p<0.01). Following REMS in 2010, mean hematocrit levels at ESA initiation decreased from 30% to 21% (p<0.01). Black box warnings preceded decreased ESA use among VA cancer patients with CIA. REMS was followed by reduced hematocrit levels at ESA initiation. Our findings contrast with privately- insured and Medicaid insured cancer patient data on chemotherapy-induced anemia where ESA use decreased to 3% to 7% by 2010-2012. By 2012, the era of ESA administration to VA to cancer patients had ended but the warnings remain relevant and significant. In 2019, oncology\/hematology national guidelines (ASCO\/ASH) recommend that cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia should receive ESAs or red blood cell transfusions after risk-benefit evaluation.","1174":"Between 2014 and 2018, the HPTN 071 PopART study was conducted to quantify the public health benefits of ART. Viral samples from 7124 study participants in Zambia were deep-sequenced as part of HPTN 071-02 PopART Phylogenetics, an ancillary study. We used these sequences to identify likely transmission pairs. After demographic weighting of the recipients in these pairs to match the overall HIV-positive population, we analysed the demographic characteristics of the sources to better understand transmission in the general population.In the last decade, universally available antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to greatly improved health and survival of people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, but new infections continue to appear. The design of effective prevention strategies requires the demographic characterisation of individuals acting as sources of infection, which is the aim of this study.We identified a total of 300 likely transmission pairs. 178 (59\u00b74%) were male to female, with 130 (95% CI 110-150; 43\u00b73%) from males aged 25-40 years. Overall, men transmitted 2\u00b709-fold (2\u00b706-2\u00b729) more infections per capita than women, a ratio peaking at 5\u00b787 (2\u00b778-15\u00b78) in the 35-39 years source age group. 40 (26-57; 13\u00b72%) transmissions linked individuals from different communities in the trial. Of 288 sources with recorded information on drug resistance mutations, 52 (38-69; 18\u00b71%) carried viruses resistant to first-line ART.National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, International Initiative for Impact Evaluation, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and National Institute of Mental Health.HIV-1 transmission in the HPTN 071 study communities comes from a wide range of age and sex groups, and there is no outsized contribution to new infections from importation or drug resistance mutations. Men aged 25-39 years, underserved by current treatment and prevention services, should be prioritised for HIV testing and\u00a0ART.","1175":"Significant differences in geographic access to EmONC in Kigoma Region, Tanzania, were observed both by location and by primary transportation type. As most of the population may only have good EmONC access when using mechanized or motorized vehicles, bicycles and motorcycles should be incorporated into the health transportation strategy. Collaboration between private transportation sectors and obstetric service providers could improve access to EmONC services among most populations. In areas where residents may not access EmONC facilities within 2 hours regardless of the type of transportation used, upgrading EmONC capacity among nearby non-EmONC facilities may be required to improve accessibility.Access to transportation is vital to reducing the travel time to emergency obstetric and neonatal care (EmONC) for managing complications and preventing adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. This study examines the distribution of travel times to EmONC in Kigoma Region, Tanzania, using various transportation schemes, to estimate the proportion of live births (a proxy indicator of women needing delivery care) with poor geographic access to EmONC services.The 2014 Reproductive Health Survey of Kigoma Region identified 4 primary means of transportation used to travel to health facilities: walking, cycling, motorcycle, and 4-wheeled motor vehicle. A raster-based travel time model was used to map the 2-hour travel time catchment for each mode of transportation. Live birth density distributions were aggregated by travel time catchments, and by administrative council, to estimate the proportion of births with poor access.Of all live births in Kigoma Region, 13% occurred in areas where women can reach EmONC facilities within 2 hours on foot, 33% in areas that can be reached within 2 hours only by motorized vehicles, and 32% where it is impossible to reach EmONC facilities within 2 hours. Over 50% of births in 3 of the 8 administrative councils had poor estimated access. In half the councils, births with poor access could be reduced to no higher than 12% if all female residents had access to motorized vehicles.","1176":"The mammalian gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome, which plays indispensable roles in host nutrition and health, is affected by numerous intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Among them, antibiotic (ATB) treatment is reported to have a significant effect on GI microbiome composition in humans and other animals. However, the impact of ATBs on the GI microbiome of free-ranging or even captive great apes remains poorly characterized. Here, we investigated the effect of cephalosporin treatment (delivered by intramuscular dart injection during a serious respiratory outbreak) on the GI microbiome of a wild habituated group of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in the Dzanga Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic. We examined 36 fecal samples from eight individuals, including samples before and after ATB treatment, and characterized the GI microbiome composition using Illumina-MiSeq sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The GI microbial profiles of samples from the same individuals before and after ATB administration indicate that the ATB treatment impacts GI microbiome stability and the relative abundance of particular bacterial taxa within the colonic ecosystem of wild gorillas. We observed a statistically significant increase in Firmicutes and a decrease in Bacteroidetes levels after ATB treatment. We found disruption of the fibrolytic community linked with a decrease of Ruminoccocus levels as a result of ATB treatment. Nevertheless, the nature of the changes observed after ATB treatment differs among gorillas and thus is dependent on the individual host. This study has important implications for ecology, management, and conservation of wild primates.","1177":"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one in twenty five hospital patients are infected with at least one healthcare acquired infection (HAI) on any given day. Early detection of possible HAI outbreaks help practitioners implement countermeasures before the infection spreads extensively. Here, we develop an efficient data and model driven method to detect outbreaks with high accuracy. We leverage mechanistic modeling of C. difficile infection, a major HAI disease, to simulate its spread in a hospital wing and design efficient near-optimal algorithms to select people and locations to monitor using an optimization formulation. Results show that our strategy detects up to 95% of \"future\" C. difficile outbreaks. We design our method by incorporating specific hospital practices (like swabbing for infections) as well. As a result, our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for outbreak detection. Finally, a qualitative study of our result shows that the people and locations we select to monitor as sensors are intuitive and meaningful.","1178":"This study examines the effects of local and nationwide COVID-19 disease control measures on the health and economy of China's rural population. We conducted phone surveys with 726 randomly selected village informants across seven rural Chinese provinces in February 2020. Four villages (0.55%) reported infections, and none reported deaths. Disease control measures had been universally implemented in all sample villages. About 74% of informants reported that villagers with wage-earning jobs outside the village had stopped working due to workplace closures. A higher percentage of rural individuals could not work due to transportation, housing, and other constraints. Local governments had taken measures to reduce the impact of COVID-19. Although schools in all surveyed villages were closed, 71% of village informants reported that students were attending classes online. Overall, measures to control COVID-19 appear to have been successful in limiting disease transmission in rural communities outside the main epidemic area. Rural Chinese citizens, however, have experienced significant economic consequences from the disease control measures.","1179":" = 16) were excluded. A total of 236 products were identified, containing 42 different AAIs. A total of 76.2% products contained AAIs of \"critical importance\" according to the World Health Organization (WHO). On average, chickens consumed 791.8 (SEM \u00b116.7) mg\/kg at treatment, 323.4 (SEM \u00b111.3) mg\/kg sold, and the TI was 382.6 (SEM \u00b15.5) per 1,000 days. AMU was more common early in the production cycle and was highly skewed, with the upper 25% quantile of flocks accounting for 60.7% of total AMU. The observed discrepancies between weight- and dose-based metrics were explained by differences in the strength of AAIs, mortality levels, and the timing of administration. Results suggest that in small-scale chicken production, AMU reduction efforts should preferentially target the early (brooding) period, which is when birds are most likely to be exposed to antimicrobials, whilst restricting access to antimicrobials of critical importance for human medicine.","1180":"Clemson Rural Health implemented a novel MHC program to reach and treat populations at-risk for HCV with a focus on care for uninsured individuals.

Among those screened, the majority were male (57.5%), White (61.3%; Black\/Hispanic: 28.2%\/7.7%), and without personal vehicle as primary transportation mode (54.4%). Injection drug use (IDU) was 27.2% and uninsured rate was 42.8%. Compared to HCV-negative, those infected included more individuals aged 30-44 (52.1% vs. 36.4%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.023), male (70.2% vs. 55.2%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.009), White (78.5% vs. 60.2%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), without personal vehicle (58.5% vs. 43.5%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.028), IDU (83.7% vs. 21.0%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), and uninsured (61.2% vs. 48.8%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.050). Uninsured rates were higher among those initiating compared to not initiating treatment (74.5% vs. 45.3%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004).Gilead Sciences, Inc., and SC Center for Rural and Primary Healthcare.The MHC framework successfully reaching its target population: at-risk individuals with access barriers to healthcare. The high HCV screening and treatment initiation\/completion rates demonstrate the utility of MHCs as effective and acceptable intervention settings among historically difficult-to-treat populations.Although treatment for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is effective, individuals face access barriers. The utility of mobile health clinics (MHC), effective mechanisms for providing healthcare to underserved populations, is understudied for HCV-related interventions. We aimed to describe implementation of, and factors associated with, screening and treatment via MHCs.","1181":"Pathogens of past and current infections have been identified directly by means of PCR or indirectly by measuring a specific immune response (e.g., antibody titration). Using a novel approach, Emerson and colleagues showed that the cytomegalovirus serostatus can also be accurately determined by using a T cell receptor repertoire data mining approach. In this study, we have sequenced the CD4+ memory T cell receptor repertoire of a Belgian cohort with known cytomegalovirus serostatus. A random forest classifier was trained on the CMV specific T cell receptor repertoire signature and used to classify individuals in the Belgian cohort. This study shows that the novel approach can be reliably replicated with an equivalent performance as that reported by Emerson and colleagues. Additionally, it provides evidence that the T cell receptor repertoire signature is to a large extent present in the CD4+ memory repertoire.","1182":"Many men who have sex with men (MSM) use apps to connect with and meet other MSM. Given that these apps are often used to arrange sexual encounters, it is possible that apps may be suitable venues for messages and initiatives related to HIV prevention such as those to increase HIV testing rates among this population.The purpose of this study was to assess willingness to use a new app for reminders of when to be tested for HIV infection among a sample of MSM in London who use apps to arrange sexual encounters.MSM in this sample are willing to use a new app for HIV testing reminders. Given the high levels of willingness to use them, these types of apps should be developed, evaluated, and made available for this population.Broadcast advertisements targeted users of a popular social-networking app for MSM in London. Advertisements directed users to a Web-based survey of sexual behaviors and sexual health needs. Willingness to use apps for reminders of when to be tested for HIV was assessed. In addition, participants responded to items assessing recent sexual behaviors, substance use, and demographic characteristics. Exploratory analyses were undertaken to examine differences in willingness to use an app by demographic and behavioral characteristics.Broadcast advertisements yielded a sample of 169 HIV-negative MSM. Overall, two-thirds (108\/169, 63.9%) reported willingness to use an app to remind them when to be tested for HIV. There were no significant differences in willingness to use these apps based on demographic characteristics, but MSM who reported recent binge drinking and recent club drug use more frequently reported willingness to use this app compared to their nonusing counterparts.","1183":"Rapidly evolving RNA viruses continuously produce minority haplotypes that can become dominant if they are drug-resistant or can better evade the immune system. Therefore, early detection and identification of minority viral haplotypes may help to promptly adjust the patient's treatment plan preventing potential disease complications. Minority haplotypes can be identified using next-generation sequencing, but sequencing noise hinders accurate identification. The elimination of sequencing noise is a non-trivial task that still remains open. Here we propose CliqueSNV based on extracting pairs of statistically linked mutations from noisy reads. This effectively reduces sequencing noise and enables identifying minority haplotypes with the frequency below the sequencing error rate. We comparatively assess the performance of CliqueSNV using an in vitro mixture of nine haplotypes that were derived from the mutation profile of an existing HIV patient. We show that CliqueSNV can accurately assemble viral haplotypes with frequencies as low as 0.1% and maintains consistent performance across short and long bases sequencing platforms.","1184":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is recognised as a leading cause of severe acute respiratory disease and deaths among infants and vulnerable adults. Clinical RSV isolates can be divided into several known genotypes. RSV genotype BA, characterised by a 60-nucleotide duplication in the G glycoprotein gene, emerged in 1999 and quickly disseminated globally replacing other RSV group B genotypes. Continual molecular epidemiology is critical to understand the evolutionary processes maintaining the success of the BA viruses. We analysed 735 G gene sequences from samples collected from paediatric patients in Kilifi, Kenya, between 2003 and 2017. The virus population comprised of several genetically distinct variants (n\u2009=\u200956) co-circulating within and between epidemics. In addition, there was consistent seasonal fluctuations in relative genetic diversity. Amino acid changes increasingly accumulated over the surveillance period including two residues (N178S and Q180R) that mapped to monoclonal antibody 2D10 epitopes, as well as addition of putative N-glycosylation sequons. Further, switching and toggling of amino acids within and between epidemics was observed. On a global phylogeny, the BA viruses from different countries form geographically isolated clusters suggesting substantial localized variants. This study offers insights into longitudinal population dynamics of a globally endemic RSV genotype within a discrete location.","1185":"ClinicalTrials.gov NCT:01864603.Hypertension treatment reduces morbidity and mortality yet has not been broadly implemented in many low-resource settings, including sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We hypothesized that a patient-centered integrated chronic disease model that included hypertension treatment and leveraged the HIV care system would reduce mortality among adults with uncontrolled hypertension in rural Kenya and Uganda.In this cluster randomized comparison where both arms received population-level hypertension screening, implementation of a patient-centered hypertension care model was associated with a 21% reduction in all-cause mortality and a 22% improvement in hypertension control compared to standard care among adults with baseline uncontrolled hypertension. Patient-centered chronic care programs for HIV can be leveraged to reduce the overall burden of cardiovascular mortality in SSA.This is a secondary analysis of the SEARCH trial (NCT:01864603), in which 32 communities underwent baseline population-based multidisease testing, including hypertension screening, and were randomized to standard country-guided treatment or to a patient-centered integrated chronic care model including treatment for hypertension, diabetes, and HIV. Patient-centered care included on-site introduction to clinic staff at screening, nursing triage to expedite visits, reduced visit frequency, flexible clinic hours, and a welcoming clinic environment. The analytic population included nonpregnant adults (\u226518 years) with baseline uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure \u2265140\/90 mm Hg). The primary outcome was 3-year all-cause mortality with comprehensive population-level assessment. Secondary outcomes included hypertension control assessed at a population level at year 3 (defined per country guidelines as at least 1 blood pressure measure <140\/90 mm Hg on 3 repeated measures). Between-arm comparisons used cluster-level targeted maximum likelihood estimation. Among 86,078 adults screened at study baseline (June 2013 to July 2014), 10,928 (13%) had uncontrolled hypertension. Median age was 53 years (25th to 75th percentile 40 to 66); 6,058 (55%) were female; 677 (6%) were HIV infected; and 477 (4%) had diabetes mellitus. Overall, 174 participants (3.2%) in the intervention group and 225 participants (4.1%) in the control group died during 3 years of follow-up (adjusted relative risk (aRR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 0.97, p = 0.028). Among those with baseline grade 3 hypertension (\u2265180\/110 mm Hg), 22 (4.9%) in the intervention group and 42 (7.9%) in the control group died during 3 years of follow-up (aRR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.97, p = 0.038). Estimated population-level hypertension control at year 3 was 53% in intervention and 44% in control communities (aRR 1.22, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.33, p < 0.001). Study limitations include inability to identify specific causes of death and control conditions that exceeded current standard hypertension care.","1186":"Individuals with African ancestry have extensive genomic diversity but have been underrepresented in genomic research. There is also extensive global diversity in the exposome (the totality of human environmental exposures from conception onwards) which should be considered for integrative genomic and environmental health research in Africa. To address current research gaps, we organized a workshop on environmental health research in Africa in conjunction with the H3Africa Consortium and the African Society of Human Genetics meetings in Kigali, Rwanda. The workshop was open to all researchers with an interest in environmental health in Africa and involved presentations from experts within and outside of the Consortium. This workshop highlighted innovative research occurring on the African continent related to environmental health and the interplay between the environment and the human genome. Stories of success, challenges, and collaborative opportunities were discussed through presentations, breakout sessions, poster presentations, and a panel discussion. The workshop informed participants about environmental risk factors that can be incorporated into current or future epidemiology studies and addressed research design considerations, biospecimen collection and storage, biomarkers for measuring chemical exposures, laboratory strategies, and statistical methodologies. Inclusion of environmental exposure measurements with genomic data, including but not limited to H3Africa projects, can offer a strong platform for building gene-environment (G x E) research in Africa. Opportunities to leverage existing resources and add environmental exposure data for ongoing and planned studies were discussed. Future directions include expanding the measurement of both genomic and exposomic risk factors and incorporating sophisticated statistical approaches for analyzing high dimensional G x E data. A better understanding of how environmental and genomic factors interact with nutrition and infection is also needed. Considering that the environment represents many modifiable risk factors, these research findings can inform intervention and prevention efforts towards improving global health.","1187":"We observed a 27% reduction in the additional unexplained spatial variation in incidence of P falciparum malaria and a 23% reduction in P vivax malaria when mining was included in our models. The effect of temperature on malaria was greater in high mining areas than low mining areas, and the P falciparum malaria effect size at temperatures of 26\u00b75\u00b0C (2\u00b74 cases per 1000 people [95% CI 1\u00b778-3\u00b706]) was twice as high as the effect in low mining areas (1 case per 1000 people [0\u00b768-1\u00b749]).We show that mining activity in southern Venezuela is associated with hotspots of malaria transmission. Increased temperatures exacerbated malaria transmission in mining areas, highlighting the need to consider how environmental degradation modulates climate effect on disease risk, which is especially important in areas subjected to rapidly rising temperatures and land-use change globally. Our findings have implications for the progress towards malaria elimination in the Latin American region. Our findings are also important for effectively targeting timely treatment programmes and vector-control activities in mining areas with high rates of malaria transmission.Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, Royal Society, US National Institutes of Health, and Global Challenges Research Fund. using annual land cover maps from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative between 1996 and 2016. We modelled monthly cases of P falciparum and P vivax malaria using a Bayesian hierarchical mixed model framework. We quantified the variation explained by mining activity before exploring the modifying effects of environmental degradation on climate-malaria relationships.For the Spanish translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.Environmental degradation facilitates the emergence of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, through changes in the ecological landscape that increase human-vector contacts and that expand vector habitats. However, the modifying effects of environmental degradation on climate-disease relationships have not been well explored. Here, we investigate the rapid re-emergence of malaria in a transmission hotspot in southern Venezuela and explore the synergistic effects of environmental degradation, specifically gold-mining activity, and climate variation.","1188":"At least 1 mosquito was infected by 32.6% (100 of 307) of the blood samples; in total, 7.6% of mosquitoes (916 of 12 079) were infected. The proportion of infectious individuals and infected mosquitoes were negatively associated with age and positively with asexual parasites (P < .001). Human infectiousness was higher at the start of the wet season and subsequently declined at the peak of the wet season (adjusted odds ratio, 0.52; P = .06) and in the dry season (0.23; P < .001). Overall, microscopy-negative individuals were responsible for 28.7% of infectious individuals (25 of 87) and 17.0% of mosquito infections (145 of 855).Our study reveals that the infectious reservoir peaks at the start of the wet season, with prominent roles for infections in children and submicroscopic infections. These findings have important consequences for strategies and the timing of interventions, which need to include submicroscopic infections and be implemented in the dry season.We longitudinally determined human infectiousness to mosquitoes and P. falciparum carriage by an ultrasensitive RNA-based diagnostics in 130 randomly selected inhabitants of an endemic area.Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes are essential for malaria transmission. Malaria control measures that aim at reducing transmission require an accurate characterization of the human infectious reservoir.","1189":"We demonstrate the potential of a phylogenetic method to infer the direction of HIV transmission between two individuals using whole-genome and pol NGS data.Phylogenetic analysis can be used to assess HIV transmission in populations. We inferred the direction of HIV transmission using whole-genome HIV sequences from couples with known linked infection and known transmission direction.Using whole-genome NGS data, transmission direction was inferred correctly (index to partner) for 98\/105 (93.3%) of the individual sample pairs, 99\/105 (94.3%) sample pairs using group analysis, and 31 (96.9%) of the 32 couples using multi-sample group analysis. There were no cases where the incorrect transmission direction (partner to index) was inferred. The accuracy of the method was higher with greater time between index and partner sample collection. Pol region sequences performed better than env or gag sequences for inferring transmission direction.Complete next generation sequencing (NGS) data were obtained for 105 unique index-partner sample pairs from 32 couples enrolled in the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 052 trial (up to two samples\/person). Index samples were obtained up to 5.5 years before partner infection; partner samples were obtained near the time of seroconversion. The bioinformatics method, phyloscanner, was used to infer transmission direction. Analyses were performed using samples from individual sample pairs, samples from all couples (one sample\/person; group analysis) and all available samples (multi-sample group analysis). Analysis was also performed using NGS data from defined regions of the HIV genome (gag, pol, env).","1190":"Despite the widespread implementation of public health measures, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread in the United States. To facilitate an agile response to the pandemic, we developed How We Feel, a web and mobile application that collects longitudinal self-reported survey responses on health, behaviour and demographics. Here, we report results from over 500,000 users in the United States from 2 April 2020 to 12 May 2020. We show that self-reported surveys can be used to build predictive models to identify likely COVID-19-positive individuals. We find evidence among our users for asymptomatic or presymptomatic presentation; show a variety of exposure, occupational and demographic risk factors for COVID-19 beyond symptoms; reveal factors for which users have been SARS-CoV-2 PCR tested; and highlight the temporal dynamics of symptoms and self-isolation behaviour. These results highlight the utility of collecting a diverse set of symptomatic, demographic, exposure and behavioural self-reported data to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.","1191":"Inferring the transmission direction between linked individuals living with HIV provides unparalleled power to understand the epidemiology that determines transmission. Phylogenetic ancestral-state reconstruction approaches infer the transmission direction by identifying the individual in whom the most recent common ancestor of the virus populations originated. While these methods vary in accuracy, it is unclear why. To evaluate the performance of phylogenetic ancestral-state reconstruction to determine the transmission direction of HIV-1 infection, we inferred the transmission direction for 112 transmission pairs where transmission direction and detailed additional information were available. We then fit a statistical model to evaluate the extent to which epidemiological, sampling, genetic, and phylogenetic factors influenced the outcome of the inference. Finally, we repeated the analysis under real-life conditions with only routinely available data. We found that whether ancestral-state reconstruction correctly infers the transmission direction depends principally on the phylogeny's topology. For example, under real-life conditions, the probability of identifying the correct transmission direction increases from 32%-when a monophyletic-monophyletic or paraphyletic-polyphyletic tree topology is observed and when the tip closest to the root does not agree with the state at the root-to 93% when a paraphyletic-monophyletic topology is observed and when the tip closest to the root agrees with the root state. Our results suggest that documenting larger differences in relative intrahost diversity increases our confidence in the transmission direction inference of linked pairs for population-level studies of HIV. These findings provide a practical starting point to determine our confidence in transmission direction inference from ancestral-state reconstruction.","1192":"We estimated time from seroconversion to seroreversion and infection fatality ratio (IFR) using mortality data from March to October 2020 and population-level cross-sectional seroprevalence data from April to August 2020 in New York City and Connecticut. We then estimated the daily seroprevalence and cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Serology tests can identify previous infections and facilitate estimation of the number of total infections. However, immunoglobulins targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported to wane below the detectable level of serologic assays (which is not necessarily equivalent to the duration of protective immunity). We estimate the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection from serology studies, accounting for expected levels of antibody acquisition (seroconversion) and waning (seroreversion), and apply this framework using data from New York City and Connecticut.The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is underestimated using cross-sectional serology data without adjustment for waning antibodies. Our approach can help quantify the magnitude of underestimation and adjust estimates for waning antibodies.The estimated average time from seroconversion to seroreversion was 3-4 months. The estimated IFR was 1.1% (95% credible interval: 1.0-1.2%) in New York City and 1.4% (1.1-1.7%) in Connecticut. The estimated daily seroprevalence declined after a peak in the spring. The estimated cumulative incidence reached 26.8% (24.2-29.7%) at the end of September in New York City and 8.8% (7.1-11.3%) in Connecticut, higher than maximum seroprevalence measures (22.1% and 6.1%), respectively.","1193":"There was a positive association between forest coverage around a village and indigenous malaria cases. Most local transmission was observed in the heavily forested subdistricts on the international borders with Laos and Cambodia, which are where the most receptive villages are located. These areas are at greater risk of importation of malaria due to population mobility and forest-going activities. Combining forest cover and recent case surveillance data with measures of vulnerability may be useful for prediction of malaria recurrence risk.There was a non-linear decrease in annual cases by 96.6% (1061 to 36) across the two provinces from 2011 to 2021. Indigenous Annual Parasite Index (API) and approximated Rc were higher in villages in highly forested subdistricts, and with higher forest cover within 5\u00a0km. Forest cover was also higher in malaria foci which consistently reported malaria cases each year than those which did not. An Rc\u2009>\u20091 was only reported in villages in subdistricts with\u2009>\u200925% forest cover. When applying a simple risk score using forest cover and recent case history, the classifications were comparable to those of the risk stratification system currently used by the DVBD.Geolocated, anonymized, individual-level surveillance data from 2011 to 2021 from the Thai Division of Vector-Borne Disease (DVBD) was used to calculate incidence and estimated Rc at village level. Forest cover was calculated using raster maps of tree crown cover density and year of forest loss from the publicly available Hansen dataset. Incidence and forest cover were compared graphically and using Spearman's rho. The current foci classification system was applied to data from the last 5\u00a0years (2017-2021) and forest cover for 2021 compared between the classifications. A simple risk score was developed to identify villages with high receptivity.Thailand aimed to eliminate malaria by 2024, and as such is planning for future prevention of re-establishment\u00a0in malaria free provinces. Understanding the receptivity of local areas to malaria allows the appropriate targeting of interventions. Current approaches to assessing receptivity involve collecting entomological data. Forest coverage is known to be associated with malaria risk, as an environment conducive to both vector breeding and high-risk human behaviours.","1194":"Anterior nasal swabs (ANS) are established specimen collection methods for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection detection. While saliva (SA) specimens provide an alternative, few studies have comprehensively characterized the performance of SA specimens in longitudinal studies.We compared SARS-CoV-2 detections between paired self-collected ANS and SA specimens from a household transmission study. Participants recorded symptoms and paired ANS and SA specimens daily for 14 days. Specimens were tested using RT-PCR. We calculated the proportion of detections identified by each specimen type among the detections from both types combined. We computed percent agreement and Kappa statistics to assess concordance in detections. We also computed estimates stratified by presence of symptoms and examined the influence of traditional and inactivating transport media on the performance of ANS.We examined 2535 self-collected paired specimens from 216 participants. Among 1238 (49%) paired specimens with detections by either specimen type, ANS identified 77.1% (954; 95% CI, 74.6% to 79.3%) and SA 81.9% (1014; 95% CI, 79.7% to 84.0%), with a difference of 4.9% (95% CI, 1.4% to 8.5%). Overall agreement was 80.0%, and Kappa was 0.6 (95% CI, 0.5 to 0.6). Nevertheless, the difference in the proportion of detections identified by ANS and SA using traditional and inactivating transport media was 32.5% (95% CI, 26.8% to 38.0%) and -9.5% (95% CI, -13.7% to -5.2%), respectively. Among participants who remained asymptomatic, the difference in detections between SA and ANS was 51.2% (95% CI, 31.8% to 66.0%) and 26.1% (95% CI, 0% to 48.5%) using traditional and inactivating media, respectively.Self-collected saliva specimens provide a noninvasive alternative to nasal swabs, especially to those collected in traditional transport media, for longitudinal field studies that aim to detect both symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.","1195":"Leukoreduced RBC concentrate-derived samples from 13,403 donors were stored for 39 to 42 days (1-6\u00b0C) and then evaluated for storage, osmotic, and oxidative hemolysis. Iron status was evaluated by plasma ferritin measurement and self-reported intake of iron supplements. Donation history in the prior 2 years was obtained for each subject.Frequent whole blood donations increase the prevalence of iron depletion in blood donors, which may subsequently interfere with normal erythropoiesis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the associations between donation frequency and red blood cell (RBC) storage stability in a racially\/ethnically diverse population of blood donors.Frequent blood donations may alter the quality of blood components by modulating RBC predisposition to hemolysis. RBCs collected from frequent donors with low ferritin have altered susceptibility to hemolysis. Thus, frequent donation and associated iron loss may alter the quality of stored RBC components collected from iron-deficient donors. Further investigation is necessary to assess posttransfusion safety and efficacy in patients receiving these RBC products.Frequent blood donors enrolled in this study were likely to be white, male, and of older age (56.1 \u00b1 5.0 years). Prior donation intensity was negatively associated with oxidative hemolysis (p < 0.0001) in multivariate analyses correcting for age, sex, and race\/ethnicity. Increased plasma ferritin concentration was associated with increased RBC susceptibility to each of the three measures of hemolysis (p < 0.0001 for all), whereas self-reported iron intake was associated with reduced susceptibility to osmotic and oxidative hemolysis (p < 0.0001 for both).","1196":"We included ATHENA cohort data which prospectively includes 98% of PLWH in the Netherlands. PLWH who initiated ART in 2013 were included and followed over five years. PLWH were divided in three categories based on CD4 cell-count at time of ART initiation: timely presentation (CD4>350cells\/\u03bcL), late presentation (CD4 200-350cells\/\u03bcL or >350cells\/\u03bcL with AIDS-defining illness) and very late presentation (CD4<200cells\/\u03bcL). The total HIV-care cost was calculated distinguishing ART medication and non-ART medication costs (hospitalization, outpatient clinic visits, co-medications, and HIV-laboratory tests).Very late presentation is associated with substantial costs, with non-ART costs nearly seven times higher than for those presenting timely. Hospitalization and co-medication costs are likely to continue to drive higher costs for individuals with late presentation into the future. Programs that identify individuals earlier will therefore likely provide significant short- and long-term health cost savings.In Europe, half of people living with HIV (PLWH) present late to care, with associated higher morbidity and mortality. This study aims to assess short- and long-term costs of HIV-care based on time of presentation and identify other factors contributing to higher costs in the first and fifth year after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation.From 1,296 PLWH, 273 (21%) presented late and 179 (14%) very late. Nearly half of those who entered HIV-care in a very late stage were of non-Dutch origin, with 21% originating from sub-Saharan Africa. The mean cost per patient in the first year was \u20ac12,902 (SD\u20ac11,098), of which about two-thirds due to ART (\u20ac8,250 (SD\u20ac3,142)). ART costs in the first and fifth year were comparable regardless of time of presentation. During the first year on treatment, non-ART medication costs were substantially higher among those with late presentation (\u20ac4,749 (SD\u20ac8,009)) and very late presentation (\u20ac15,886 (SD\u20ac 21,834)), compared with timely presentation (\u20ac2,407(SD\u20ac4,511)). Higher non-ART costs were attributable to hospitalization and co-medication. The total non-ART costs incurred across five years on treatment were 56% and 246% higher for late and very late presentation respectively as compared to timely presentation.","1197":"International travel-related nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), which can include traveler screening, travel restrictions, and border closures, often are included in national influenza pandemic preparedness plans. We performed systematic reviews to identify evidence for their effectiveness. We found 15 studies in total. Some studies reported that NPIs could delay the introduction of influenza virus. However, no available evidence indicated that screening of inbound travelers would have a substantial effect on preventing spread of pandemic influenza, and no studies examining exit screening were found. Some studies reported that travel restrictions could delay the start of local transmission and slow international spread, and 1 study indicated that small Pacific islands were able to prevent importation of pandemic influenza during 1918-19 through complete border closure. This limited evidence base indicates that international travel-related NPIs would have limited effectiveness in controlling pandemic influenza and that these measures require considerable resources to implement.","1198":"Infectious disease epidemics present a difficult task for policymakers, requiring the implementation of control strategies under significant time constraints and uncertainty. Mathematical models can be used to predict the outcome of control interventions, providing useful information to policymakers in the event of such an epidemic. However, these models suffer in the early stages of an outbreak from a lack of accurate, relevant information regarding the dynamics and spread of the disease and the efficacy of control. As such, recommendations provided by these models are often incorporated in an ad hoc fashion, as and when more reliable information becomes available. In this work, we show that such trial-and-error-type approaches to management, which do not formally take into account the resolution of uncertainty and how control actions affect this, can lead to sub-optimal management outcomes. We compare three approaches to managing a theoretical epidemic: a non-adaptive management (AM) approach that does not use real-time outbreak information to adapt control, a passive AM approach that incorporates real-time information if and when it becomes available, and an active AM approach that explicitly incorporates the future resolution of uncertainty through gathering real-time information into its initial recommendations. The structured framework of active AM encourages the specification of quantifiable objectives, models of system behaviour and possible control and monitoring actions, followed by an iterative learning and control phase that is able to employ complex control optimisations and resolve system uncertainty. The result is a management framework that is able to provide dynamic, long-term projections to help policymakers meet the objectives of management. We investigate in detail the effect of different methods of incorporating up-to-date outbreak information. We find that, even in a highly simplified system, the method of incorporating new data can lead to different results that may influence initial policy decisions, with an active AM approach to management providing better information that can lead to more desirable outcomes from an epidemic.","1199":"COVID-19 vaccination rates among children have stalled, while new coronavirus strains continue to emerge. To improve child vaccination rates, policymakers must better understand parental preferences and reasons for COVID-19 vaccination among their children. Cross-sectional surveys were administered online to 30,174 US parents with at least one child of COVID-19 vaccine eligible age (5-17 years) between January 1 and May 9, 2022. Participants self-reported willingness to vaccinate their child and reasons for refusal, and answered additional questions about demographics, pandemic related behavior, and vaccination status. Willingness to vaccinate a child for COVID-19 was strongly associated with parental vaccination status (multivariate odds ratio 97.9, 95% confidence interval 86.9-111.0). The majority of fully vaccinated (86%) and unvaccinated (84%) parents reported concordant vaccination preferences for their eligible child. Age and education had differing relationships by vaccination status, with higher age and education positively associated with willingness among vaccinated parents. Among all parents unwilling to vaccinate their children, the two most frequently reported reasons were possible side effects (47%) and that vaccines are too new (44%). Unvaccinated parents were much more likely to list a lack of trust in government (41% to 21%, p < .001) and a lack of trust in scientists (34% to 19%, p < .001) as reasons for refusal. Cluster analysis identified three groups of unwilling parents based on their reasons for refusal to vaccinate, with distinct concerns that may be obscured when analyzed in aggregate. Factors associated with willingness to vaccinate children and reasons for refusal may inform targeted approaches to increase vaccination.","1200":"Substantial heterogeneity in measles outbreak sizes may be due to genotype-specific transmissibility. Using a branching process analysis, we characterize differences in measles transmission by estimating the association between genotype and the reproduction number R among postelimination California measles cases during 2000-2015 (400 cases, 165 outbreaks).Genotype B3 is found to be significantly more transmissible than other genotypes (P = .01) with an R of 0.64 (95% confidence interval [CI], .48-.71), while the R for all other genotypes combined is 0.43 (95% CI, .28-.54). This result is robust to excluding the 2014-2015 outbreak linked to Disneyland theme parks (referred to as \"outbreak A\" for conciseness and clarity) (P = .04) and modeling genotype as a random effect (P = .004 including outbreak A and P = .02 excluding outbreak A). This result was not accounted for by season of introduction, age of index case, or vaccination of the index case. The R for outbreaks with a school-aged index case is 0.69 (95% CI, .52-.78), while the R for outbreaks with a non-school-aged index case is 0.28 (95% CI, .19-.35), but this cannot account for differences between genotypes.Assuming a negative binomial secondary case distribution, we fit a branching process model to the distribution of outbreak sizes using maximum likelihood and estimated the reproduction number R for a multigenotype model.Variability in measles transmissibility may have important implications for measles control; the vaccination threshold required for elimination may not be the same for all genotypes or age groups.","1201":"We analysed data from a randomized controlled trial on the reactogenicity of three enhanced influenza vaccines compared to standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine.Reported reactions were generally mild and short-lived. Systemic reactions occurred in similar proportions of participants by vaccine. Some local reactions were slightly more frequently reported among recipients of the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine and the high-dose vaccine compared to standard dose recipients. Participants reporting feverishness one day after vaccination had mean-fold-rises in post-vaccination hemagglutination inhibition titers that were 1.85-fold higher (95% CI: 1.01, 3.38) for A(H1N1) compared to those who did not report feverishness.We enrolled community-dwelling older adults in Hong Kong, and randomly allocated them to receive 2017\/18 northern hemisphere formulations of: standard-dose vaccine (FluQuadri, Sanofi Pasteur); MF59-adjuvanted vaccine (FLUAD, Seqirus); high-dose vaccine (Fluzone High Dose, Sanofi Pasteur); or recombinant-hemagglutinin vaccine (Flublok, Sanofi Pasteur). Local and systemic reactions were evaluated at Days 1, 3, 7 and 14 after vaccination.Some acute local reactions were more frequent following vaccination with MF59-adjuvanted and high-dose influenza vaccines compared to standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine, while systemic symptoms occurred at similar frequencies in all groups. The association between feverishness and immunogenicity should be further investigated in a larger population.","1202":"Of 56 participants, 53 (53.6% female, mean age 26.5 (SD 7.5) years) completed the study. During daytime sleep on a workday, 49.1% of participants had blunted systolic BP (SBP) or diastolic BP (DBP) dipping. During night-time sleep on a non-workday, 25% had blunted SBP dipping and 3.9% blunted DBP dipping. Blunted SBP or DBP dipping occurred among all participants who did not nap during the night shift or who napped <60\u2009min. Blunted SBP dipping occurred in only 14.3% of participants who napped 60-120\u2009min.During night shift work, the BP dipping of EMS shift workers is blunted; however, most who nap for 60\u2009min or longer experience a healthy dip in BP. The potential health consequences of these observations in EMS clinicians warrant further study.Participants worked night shifts. Hourly ABPM and wrist actigraphy (to measure sleep) were collected during two 24-hour periods, one scheduled night shift and one non-workday. Blunted BP dipping was defined as a BP decrease of <10%.Higher 24-hour blood pressure (BP) and blunted BP dipping during sleep and night-time hours are associated with adverse health outcomes. Night shift work may affect 24-hour BP and dipping patterns, but empirical data in emergency medical services (EMS) clinician shift workers are sparse. We implemented ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in EMS workers to characterise BP during night shift work versus a non-workday, and sleep versus wake.","1203":"Vector-borne diseases are particularly sensitive to changes in weather and climate. Timely warnings from surveillance systems can help to detect and control outbreaks of infectious disease, facilitate effective management of finite resources, and contribute to knowledge generation, response planning, and resource prioritisation in the long term, which can mitigate future outbreaks. Technological and digital innovations have enabled the incorporation of climatic data into surveillance systems, enhancing their capacity to predict trends in outbreak prevalence and location. Advance notice of the risk of an outbreak empowers decision makers and communities to scale up prevention and preparedness interventions and redirect resources for outbreak responses. In this Viewpoint, we outline important considerations in the advent of new technologies in disease surveillance, including the sustainability of innovation in the long term and the fundamental obligation to ensure that the communities that are affected by the disease are involved in the design of the technology and directly benefit from its application.","1204":"For Denmark, Spain, and the United States, we estimated age-stratified excess mortality for (i) all-cause, (ii) respiratory and circulatory, (iii) circulatory, (iv) respiratory, and (v) pneumonia, and influenza causes of death for the 2015\/2016 and 2016\/2017 influenza seasons. We quantified differences between the countries and seasonal excess mortality estimates and the death categories. We used a time-series linear regression model accounting for time and seasonal trends using mortality data from 2010 through 2017.Seasonal influenza-associated excess mortality estimates can be timely and provide useful information on the severity of an epidemic. This methodology can be leveraged during an emergency response or pandemic.The respective periods of weekly excess mortality for all-cause and cause-specific deaths were similar in their chronological patterns. Seasonal all-cause excess mortality rates for the 2015\/2016 and 2016\/2017 influenza seasons were 4.7 (3.3-6.1) and 14.3 (13.0-15.6) per 100,000 population, for the United States; 20.3 (15.8-25.0) and 24.0 (19.3-28.7) per 100,000 population for Denmark; and 22.9 (18.9-26.9) and 52.9 (49.1-56.8) per 100,000 population for Spain. Seasonal respiratory and circulatory excess mortality estimates were two to three times lower than the all-cause estimates.We observed fewer influenza-associated deaths when we examined cause-specific death categories compared with all-cause deaths and observed the same trends in peaks in deaths with all death causes. Because all-cause deaths are more available, these models can be used to monitor virus activity in near real time. This approach may contribute to the development of timely mortality monitoring systems during public health emergencies.","1205":"Viruses of microbes are ubiquitous biological entities that reprogram their hosts' metabolisms during infection in order to produce viral progeny, impacting the ecology and evolution of microbiomes with broad implications for human and environmental health. Advances in genome sequencing have led to the discovery of millions of novel viruses and an appreciation for the great diversity of viruses on Earth. Yet, with knowledge of only \"who is there?\" we fall short in our ability to infer the impacts of viruses on microbes at population, community, and ecosystem-scales. To do this, we need a more explicit understanding \"who do they infect?\" Here, we developed a novel machine learning model (ML), Virus-Host Interaction Predictor (VHIP), to predict virus-host interactions (infection\/non-infection) from input virus and host genomes. This ML model was trained and tested on a high-value manually curated set of 8849 virus-host pairs and their corresponding sequence data. The resulting dataset, 'Virus Host Range network' (VHRnet), is core to VHIP functionality. Each data point that underlies the VHIP training and testing represents a lab-tested virus-host pair in VHRnet, from which meaningful signals of viral adaptation to host were computed from genomic sequences. VHIP departs from existing virus-host prediction models in its ability to predict multiple interactions rather than predicting a single most likely host or host clade. As a result, VHIP is able to infer the complexity of virus-host networks in natural systems. VHIP has an 87.8% accuracy rate at predicting interactions between virus-host pairs at the species level and can be applied to novel viral and host population genomes reconstructed from metagenomic datasets.","1206":"CRISPR-Cas9 may offer new therapeutics for genetic diseases through gene disruption via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or gene correction via homology-directed repair (HDR). However, clinical transition of CRISPR technology is limited by the lack of safe and efficient delivery systems. Here, we report facilely fabricated pH-responsive polymer nanoparticles capable of safely and efficiently delivering Cas9 ribonucleoprotein alone (termed NHEJ-NP, diameter = 29.4\u00a0nm), or together with donor DNA (termed HDR-NP, diameter = 33.3\u00a0nm). Moreover, intravenously, intratracheally, and intramuscularly injected NHEJ-NP induced efficient gene editing in mouse liver, lung, and skeletal muscle, respectively. Intramuscularly injected HDR-NP also led to muscle strength recovery in a Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse model. NHEJ-NP and HDR-NP possess many desirable properties including high payload loading content, small and uniform sizes, high editing efficiency, good biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and ease of production, storage, and transport, making them great interest for various genome editing applications with clinical potentials.

We have made this tool available online for patients to use.The Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) is a quality improvement consortium of urology practices that maintains a prospective registry of men with CaP. We used registry data from 45 MUSIC urology practices from 2015 to 2017 to develop and validate a random forest machine learning model. After fitting the random forest model to a derivation cohort consisting of a random two-thirds sample of patients after stratifying by practice location, we evaluated the model performance in a validation cohort consisting of the remaining one-third of patients using a multiclass area under the curve (AUC) measure and calibration plots.Using clinical registry data and machine learning methods, we created a web-based platform for patients that generates accurate predictions for most CaP treatments.We identified 7543 men diagnosed with CaP, of whom 45% underwent radical prostatectomy, 30% surveillance, 17% radiation therapy, 5.6% androgen deprivation, and 1.8% watchful waiting. The personalized prediction for patients in the validation cohort was highly accurate (AUC 0.81).Clinical registries provide physicians with a means for making data-driven decisions but few opportunities exist for patients to interact with registry data to help make decisions.We sought to develop a web-based system that uses a prostate cancer (CaP) registry to provide newly diagnosed men with a platform to view predicted treatment decisions based on patients with similar characteristics.","1208":"In the US, the COVID-19 pandemic intensified some conditions that may contribute to firearm violence, and a recent surge in firearm sales during the pandemic has been reported. However, patterns of change in firearm violence in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US remain unclear.In the US, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an excess burden of firearm-related incidents, nonfatal injuries, and deaths, with substantial temporal and spatial variations.To quantify the changes in interpersonal firearm violence associated with the pandemic across all 50 US states and the District of Columbia.This population-based cross-sectional study examined 50 US states and the District of Columbia from January 1, 2016, to February 28, 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic period was defined as between March 1, 2020, and February 28, 2021. Statistical analysis was performed from April to December 2021.In the US (all 50 states and the District of Columbia) during the pandemic period of March 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021, there were 62\u202f485 identified firearm-related incidents, 40\u202f021 firearm-related nonfatal injuries, and 19\u202f818 firearm-related deaths. The pandemic period was associated with 8138 (95% empirical confidence interval [eCI], 2769-12\u202f948) excess incidents (increase of 15.0% [95% eCI, 4.6%-26.1%]), 10\u202f222 (95% eCI, 8284-11\u202f650) excess nonfatal injuries (increase of 34.3% [95% eCI, 26.1%-41.1%]), and 4381 (95% eCI, 2262-6264) excess deaths (increase of 28.4% [95% eCI, 12.9%-46.2%]). The increase in firearm-related violence was more pronounced from June to October 2020 and in Minnesota and New York State.A 2-stage interrupted time-series design was used to examine the excess burden of firearm-related incidents, nonfatal injuries, and deaths associated with the pandemic while accounting for long-term trends and seasonality. In the first stage, separate quasi-Poisson regression models were fit to the daily number of firearm events in each state. In the second stage, estimates were pooled using a multivariate meta-analysis.","1209":"High-energy-density physics is the field of physics concerned with studying matter at extremely high temperatures and densities. Such conditions produce highly nonlinear plasmas, in which several phenomena that can normally be treated independently of one another become strongly coupled. The study of these plasmas is important for our understanding of astrophysics, nuclear fusion and fundamental physics-however, the nonlinearities and strong couplings present in these extreme physical systems makes them very difficult to understand theoretically or to optimize experimentally. Here we argue that machine learning models and data-driven methods are in the process of reshaping our exploration of these extreme systems that have hitherto proved far too nonlinear for human researchers. From a fundamental perspective, our understanding can be improved by the way in which machine learning models can rapidly discover complex interactions in large datasets. From a practical point of view, the newest generation of extreme physics facilities can perform experiments multiple times a second (as opposed to approximately daily), thus moving away from human-based control towards automatic control based on real-time interpretation of diagnostic data and updates of the physics model. To make the most of these emerging opportunities, we suggest proposals for the community in terms of research design, training, best practice and support for synthetic diagnostics and data analysis.","1210":"This paper aims to investigate the global dynamics of an alcoholism epidemic model with distributed delays. The main feature of this model is that it includes the effect of the social pressure as a factor of drinking. As a result, our global stability is obtained without a \"basic reproduction number\" nor threshold condition. Hence, we prove that the alcohol addiction will be always uniformly persistent in the population. This means that the investigated model has only one positive equilibrium, and it is globally asymptotically stable independent on the model parameters. This result is shown by proving that the unique equilibrium is locally stable, and the global attraction is shown using Lyapunov direct method.","1211":"The South African COVID-19 Modelling Consortium (SACMC) was established in late March 2020 to support planning and budgeting for COVID-19 related healthcare in South Africa. We developed several tools in response to the needs of decision makers in the different stages of the epidemic, allowing the South African government to plan several months ahead.Our tools included epidemic projection models, several cost and budget impact models, and online dashboards to help government and the public visualise our projections, track case development and forecast hospital admissions. Information on new variants, including Delta and Omicron, were incorporated in real time to allow the shifting of scarce resources when necessary.The SACMC's models, developed rapidly in an emergency setting and regularly updated with local data, supported national and provincial government to plan several months ahead, expand hospital capacity when needed, allocate budgets and procure additional resources where possible. Across four waves of COVID-19 cases, the SACMC continued to serve the planning needs of the government, tracking waves and supporting the national vaccine rollout.Given the rapidly changing nature of the outbreak globally and in South Africa, the model projections were updated regularly. The updates reflected 1) the changing policy priorities over the course of the epidemic; 2) the availability of new data from South African data systems; and 3) the evolving response to COVID-19 in South Africa, such as changes in lockdown levels and ensuing mobility and contact rates, testing and contact tracing strategies and hospitalisation criteria. Insights into population behaviour required updates by incorporating notions of behavioural heterogeneity and behavioural responses to observed changes in mortality. We incorporated these aspects into developing scenarios for the third wave and developed additional methodology that allowed us to forecast required inpatient capacity. Finally, real-time analyses of the most important characteristics of the Omicron variant first identified in South Africa in November 2021 allowed us to advise policymakers early in the fourth wave that a relatively lower admission rate was likely.","1212":"). After a general discussion of the results, a diabetes-specific checklist for the transparency of model input was developed.Seven groups participated in the transparency challenge. The reporting of key model input parameters in the two studies, including the baseline characteristics of simulated patients, treatment effect and treatment intensification threshold assumptions, treatment effect evolution, prediction of complications and costs data, was inadequately transparent (and often missing altogether). Not surprisingly, goodness of fit was better for the study that reported its input data with more transparency. To improve the transparency in diabetes modeling, the Diabetes Modeling Input Checklist listing the minimal input data required for reproducibility in most diabetes modeling applications was developed.The Eighth Mount Hood Challenge (held in St. Gallen, Switzerland, in September 2016) evaluated the transparency of model input documentation from two published health economics studies and developed guidelines for improving transparency in the reporting of input data underlying model-based economic analyses in diabetes.Transparency of diabetes model inputs is important to the reproducibility and credibility of simulation results. In the Eighth Mount Hood Challenge, the Diabetes Modeling Input Checklist was developed with the goal of improving the transparency of input data reporting and reproducibility of diabetes simulation model results.","1213":"The vagina plays a critical role in supporting the pelvic organs and loss of support leads to pelvic organ prolapse. It is unknown what microstructural changes influence prolapse progression nor how decreased elastic fibers contributes to vaginal remodeling and smooth muscle contractility. The objective for this study was to evaluate the effect of fibulin-5 haploinsufficiency, and deficiency with progressive prolapse on the biaxial contractile and biomechanical function of the murine vagina. Vaginas from wildtype (n\u2009=\u200913), haploinsufficient (n\u2009=\u200913), and deficient mice with grade 1 (n\u2009=\u20099) and grade 2 or 3 (n\u2009=\u20099) prolapse were explanted for biaxial contractile and biomechanical testing. Multiaxial histology (n\u2009=\u20093\/group) evaluated elastic and collagen fiber microstructure. Western blotting quantified protein expression (n\u2009=\u20096\/group). A one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test evaluated statistical significance. Pearson's or Spearman's test determined correlations with prolapse grade. Axial contractility decreased with fibulin-5 deficiency and POP (p\u2009<\u20090.001), negatively correlated with prolapse grade (\u03c1\u2009=\u2009-\u00a00.80; p\u2009<\u20090.001), and positively correlated with muscularis elastin area fraction (\u03c1\u2009=\u2009-\u00a00.78; p\u2009=\u20090.004). Circumferential (\u03c1\u2009=\u20090.71; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and axial (\u03c1\u2009=\u20090.69; p\u2009<\u20090.001) vaginal wall stresses positively correlated with prolapse grade. These findings demonstrated that fibulin-5 deficiency and prolapse progression decreased vaginal contractility and increased vaginal wall stress. Future work is needed to better understand the processes that contribute to prolapse progression in order to guide diagnostic, preventative, and treatment strategies.","1214":"Adoption of a 12-month OCP dispensing option is expected to produce substantial cost savings for the VA while better supporting reproductive autonomy and reducing unintended pregnancy among women veterans.The Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system is the largest integrated health care system in the United States. Like most US health plans, the VA currently stipulates a 3-month maximum dispensing limit for all medications, including oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). However, 12-month OCP dispensing has been shown to improve continuation of use, decrease coverage gaps, and reduce unintended pregnancy in other practice settings.To estimate the financial and reproductive health implications for the VA of implementing a 12-month OCP dispensing option, with the goal of informing policy change.The 12-month OCP dispensing option, modeled from the VA health system perspective using a cohort of 240 309 women, resulted in anticipated VA annual cost savings of $87.12 per woman compared with the cost of 3-month dispensing, or an estimated total savings of $2\u202f117\u202f800 annually. Cost savings resulted from an absolute reduction of 24 unintended pregnancies per 1000 women per year with 12-month dispensing, or 583 unintended pregnancies averted annually. Expected cost savings with 12-month dispensing were sensitive to changes in the probability of OCP coverage gaps with 3-month dispensing, the probability of pregnancy during coverage gaps, and the proportion of pregnancies paid for by the VA. When simultaneously varying all variables across plausible ranges, the 12-month strategy was cost saving in 95.4% of model iterations.Incremental per-woman and total costs to the VA of allowing for 12-month dispensing of OCPs compared with standard 3-month dispensing.A decision model from the VA payer perspective was developed to estimate incremental costs to the health care system of allowing the option to receive a 12-month supply of OCPs up front, compared with the standard 3-month maximum, during a 1-year time horizon. A model cohort of 24\u202f309 reproductive-aged, heterosexually active, female VA enrollees who wish to avoid pregnancy for at least 1 year was assumed. Probabilities of continuation of OCP use, coverage gaps, pregnancy, and pregnancy outcomes were drawn from published data. Costs of OCP provision and pregnancy-related care and the number of women using OCPs were drawn from VA administrative data. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess model robustness.","1215":"The antiviral drug Paxlovid has been shown to rapidly reduce viral load. Coupled with vaccination, timely administration of safe and effective antivirals could provide a path towards managing COVID-19 without restrictive non-pharmaceutical measures. Here, we estimate the population-level impacts of expanding treatment with Paxlovid in the US using a multi-scale mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission that incorporates the within-host viral load dynamics of the Omicron variant. We find that, under a low transmission scenario Re\u223c1.2 treating 20% of symptomatic cases would be life and cost saving, leading to an estimated 0.26 (95% CrI: 0.03, 0.59) million hospitalizations averted, 30.61 (95% CrI: 1.69, 71.15) thousand deaths averted, and US$52.16 (95% CrI: 2.62, 122.63) billion reduction in health- and treatment-related costs. Rapid and broad use of the antiviral Paxlovid could substantially reduce COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, while averting socioeconomic hardship.","1216":"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus (SFTSV) is an emerging tick-borne virus with high fatality and an expanding endemic. Currently, effective anti-SFTSV intervention remains unavailable. Favipiravir (T-705) was recently reported to show in vitro and in animal model antiviral efficacy against SFTSV. Here, we conducted a single-blind, randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of T-705 in treating SFTS (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry website, number ChiCTR1900023350). From May to August 2018, laboratory-confirmed SFTS patients were recruited from a designated hospital and randomly assigned to receive oral T-705 in combination with supportive care or supportive care only. Fatal outcome occurred in 9.5% (7\/74) of T-705 treated patients and 18.3% (13\/71) of controls (odds ratio, 0.466, 95% CI, 0.174-1.247). Cox regression showed a significant reduction in case fatality rate (CFR) with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.366 (95% CI, 0.142-0.944). Among the low-viral load subgroup (RT-PCR cycle threshold \u226526), T-705 treatment significantly reduced CFR from 11.5 to 1.6% (P\u2009=\u20090.029), while no between-arm difference was observed in the high-viral load subgroup (RT-PCR cycle threshold <26). The T-705-treated group showed shorter viral clearance, lower incidence of hemorrhagic signs, and faster recovery of laboratory abnormities compared with the controls. The in vitro and animal experiments demonstrated that the antiviral efficacies of T-705 were proportionally induced by SFTSV mutation rates, particularly from two transition mutation types. The mutation analyses on T-705-treated serum samples disclosed a partially consistent mutagenesis pattern as those of the in vitro or animal experiments in reducing the SFTSV viral loads, further supporting the anti-SFTSV effect of T-705, especially for the low-viral loads.","1217":"Systems modeling represents an innovative approach for addressing the obesity epidemic at the community level. We developed an agent-based model of the Baltimore City food environment that permits us to assess the relative impact of different programs and policies, alone and in combination, and potential unexpected consequences. Based on this experience, and a review of literature, we have identified a set of principles, potential benefits, and challenges. Some of the key principles include the importance of early and multilevel engagement with the community prior to initiating model development and continued engagement and testing with community stakeholders. Important benefits include improving community stakeholder understanding of the system, testing of interventions before implementation, and identification of unexpected consequences. Challenges in these models include deciding on the most important, yet parsimonious factors to consider, how to model food source and food selection behavior in a realistic yet transferable manner, and identifying the appropriate outcomes and limitations of the model. ","1218":"In March 2013, public health authorities were notified of a new hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a patient receiving hemodialysis. We investigated to identify the source and prevent additional infections. We reviewed medical records, interviewed the index patient regarding hepatitis B risk factors, performed HBV molecular analysis, and observed infection control practices at the outpatient hemodialysis facility where she received care. The index patient's only identified hepatitis B risk factor was hemodialysis treatment. The facility had no other patients with known active HBV infection. One patient had evidence of a resolved HBV infection. Investigation of this individual, who was identified as the source patient, indicated that HBV reverse seroconversion and reactivation had occurred in the setting of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection and a failed kidney transplant. HBV whole genome sequences analysis from the index and source patients indicated 99.9% genetic homology. Facility observations revealed multiple infection control breaches. Inadequate dilution of the source patient's sample during HBV testing might have led to a false-negative result, delaying initiation of hemodialysis in isolation. In conclusion, HBV transmission occurred after an HIV-positive hemodialysis patient with transplant-related immunosuppression experienced HBV reverse seroconversion and reactivation. Providers should be aware of this possibility, especially among severely immunosuppressed patients, and maintain stringent infection control. ","1219":"One hundred thirty-five students tested positive for influenza A. We found a positive correlation between viral load and body temperature. Time since symptom onset seemed to have a negative correlation but was not statistically significant. We did not find any correlations between viral load and overall symptom severity or outcomes related to recovery.We enrolled students at a university health center who presented with cough and 1 additional flu-like symptom from December 2016 to February 2017. Data were collected before, during, and 5 days after the clinic visit. All those enrolled in the study received a point-of-care PCR test (cobas Liat). For those patients that tested positive for influenza A, we investigated correlations between the relative viral load and measures of disease severity and recovery.Although we found a correlation between relative viral load and body temperature, for our study population of young, overall healthy adults, we did not find that relative viral load provided additional information that could help in determining treatment and disease outcomes. It could be that viral load does provide useful additional information for other groups of patients, such as young children or older adults. Further studies on those populations are warranted.Rapid point-of-care polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostic tests generally provide a qualitative result of positive or negative only. Additional information about the relative viral load could be calculated. Such quantitative information might be useful for making treatment decisions.","1220":"Vaccines, when available, will likely become our best tool to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Even in the most optimistic scenarios, vaccine shortages will likely occur. Using an age-stratified mathematical model paired with optimization algorithms, we determined optimal vaccine allocation for four different metrics (deaths, symptomatic infections, and maximum non-ICU and ICU hospitalizations) under many scenarios. We find that a vaccine with effectiveness \u226550% would be enough to substantially mitigate the ongoing pandemic, provided that a high percentage of the population is optimally vaccinated. When minimizing deaths, we find that for low vaccine effectiveness, irrespective of vaccination coverage, it is optimal to allocate vaccine to high-risk (older) age groups first. In contrast, for higher vaccine effectiveness, there is a switch to allocate vaccine to high-transmission (younger) age groups first for high vaccination coverage. While there are other societal and ethical considerations, this work can provide an evidence-based rationale for vaccine prioritization.","1221":"Scaling up family planning has shown a significant effect to meet the SDG3 maternal mortality reduction target. A considerable proportion of unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions can be averted by scaling up contraceptive prevalence by 2% annually until 2030. Family planning is effective and a less costly intervention to reduce maternal mortality in countries with high fertility; hence, it is highly recommended to rampup all efforts to scale up contraceptive use for improving maternal health status in Ethiopia.Total fertility rate will decline to 2.3 children per women by the year 2030 when contraceptive prevalence is scaled up by 2% annually from 2016 to 2030. As a result of continuous scaling up of contraceptive use, around 3.17 million unintended pregnancies can be averted. Unmet need for family planning will significantly decline to 11.7% by 2030. Ninety-four thousand unsafe abortions could be averted and 1233 additional maternal lives could be saved by the end of 2030 in Ethiopia.Ethiopia has made great strides on under-five and maternal mortality reduction as demonstrated by achieving the millennium development target of child mortality reduction by the start of 2015. According to a recent demographic and health survey report, Ethiopia has a 67 per 1000 under-five mortality rate and a 412 per 100,000 live births maternal mortality ratio. The current trend of maternal and child mortality reduction is not enough to meet sustainable development goal three (SDG3) of maternal and child mortality reduction target which is set to reduce the maternal mortality ratio to below 70\/100,000 live births in all countries. This paper aimed to model the effect of scaling up family planning on pregnancies, live births, stillbirths, abortions and maternal mortality in Ethiopia.We used the Spectrum software package to model the impact of family planning on maternal survival and other maternal health metrics. Spectrum has different modules consisting of demproj module (demographic projection), famplan module (family planning), LiST (life saved tool), and AIM (aids impact model). We used Demproj, Famplan and LiST modules for this particular paper. Baseline national data were taken from findings of the Ethiopian demographic and health survey 2016, and World Bank and World Health Organization country specific reports.","1222":"One year into the global COVID-19 pandemic, the focus of attention has shifted to the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs). After nearly a year of the pandemic with little evolutionary change affecting human health, several variants have now been shown to have substantial detrimental effects on transmission and severity of the virus. Public health officials, medical practitioners, scientists, and the broader community have since been scrambling to understand what these variants mean for diagnosis, treatment, and the control of the pandemic through nonpharmaceutical interventions and vaccines. Here we explore the evolutionary processes that are involved in the emergence of new variants, what we can expect in terms of the future emergence of VOCs, and what we can do to minimise their impact.","1223":"Consistent engagement in care is associated with positive health outcomes among people living with HIV (PLWH). However, traditional retention measures ignore the evolving dynamics of engagement in care. To understand the longitudinal patterns of HIV care, we analyzed medical records from 2008 to 2015 of PLWH\u2009\u2265\u200918\u00a0years-old receiving care at a public, hospital-based HIV clinic (N\u2009=\u20092110). Using latent class analysis, we identified five distinct care trajectory classes: (1) consistent care (N\u2009=\u20091281); (2) less frequent care (N\u2009=\u2009270); (3) return to care after initial attrition (N\u2009=\u2009192); (4) moderate attrition (N\u2009=\u2009163); and (5) rapid attrition (N\u2009=\u2009204). The majority of PLWH in Class 1 (73.9%) had achieved sustained viral suppression (viral load \u2264 200 copies\/mL at last test and\u2009>\u200912\u00a0months prior) by study end. Among the other care classes, there was substantial variation in sustained viral suppression (61.1% in Class 2 to 3.4% in Class 5). Care trajectories could be used to prioritize re-engagement efforts.","1224":"Systematic application of observational data to the understanding of impacts of cancer treatments requires detailed information models allowing meaningful comparisons between treatment regimens. Unfortunately, details of systemic therapies are scarce in registries and data warehouses, primarily due to the complex nature of the protocols and a lack of standardization. Since 2011, we have been creating a curated and semi-structured website of chemotherapy regimens, HemOnc.org. In coordination with the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Oncology Subgroup, we have transformed a substantial subset of this content into the OMOP common data model, with bindings to multiple external vocabularies, e.g., RxNorm and the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus. Currently, there are >73,000 concepts and >177,000 relationships in the full vocabulary. Content related to the definition and composition of chemotherapy regimens has been released within the ATHENA tool (athena.ohdsi.org) for widespread utilization by the OHDSI membership. Here, we describe the rationale, data model, and initial contents of the HemOnc vocabulary along with several use cases for which it may be valuable.","1225":"How mosquitoes may respond to rapid climate warming remains unknown for most species, but will have major consequences for their future distributions, with cascading impacts on human well-being, biodiversity and ecosystem function. We investigated the adaptive potential of a wide-ranging mosquito species, Aedes sierrensis, across a large climatic gradient by conducting a common garden experiment measuring the thermal limits of mosquito life-history traits. Although field-collected populations originated from vastly different thermal environments that spanned over 1200 km, we found limited variation in upper thermal tolerance between populations. In particular, the upper thermal limits of all life-history traits varied by less than 3\u00b0C across the species range and, for most traits, did not differ significantly between populations. For one life-history trait-pupal development rate-we did detect significant variation in upper thermal limits between populations, and this variation was strongly correlated with source temperatures, providing evidence of local thermal adaptation for pupal development. However, we found that maximum environmental temperatures across most of the species' range already regularly exceed the highest upper thermal limits estimated under constant temperatures. This result suggests that strategies for coping with and\/or avoiding thermal extremes are likely key components of current and future mosquito thermal tolerance.","1226":", Volume 42 is April 2021.

Measles has been analyzed extensively as a paradigm for consumer-resource dynamics due to the oscillatory nature of the host-pathogen life cycle, the abundance of rich data to test theory, and public health relevance. The dynamics of measles in London, in particular, has acted as a prototypical test bed for such analysis using incidence data from the pre-vaccination era (1944-1967). However, during this timeframe there were few external large-scale perturbations, limiting an assessment of the relative impact of internal and extra demographic perturbations to the host population. Here, we extended the previous London analyses to include nearly a century of data that also contains four major demographic changes: the First and Second World Wars, the 1918 influenza pandemic, and the start of a measles mass vaccination program. By combining mortality and incidence data using particle filtering methods, we show that a simple stochastic epidemic model, with minimal historical specifications, can capture the nearly 100 years of dynamics including changes caused by each of the major perturbations. We show that the majority of dynamic changes are explainable by the internal nonlinear dynamics of the system, tuned by demographic changes. In addition, the 1918 influenza pandemic and World War II acted as extra perturbations to this basic epidemic oscillator. Our analysis underlines that long-term ecological and epidemiological dynamics can follow very simple rules, even in a non-stationary population subject to significant perturbations and major secular changes.","1228":"Protective antigen (PA) is a protein produced by Bacillus anthracis. It forms part of the anthrax toxin and is a key immunogen in US and UK anthrax vaccines. In this study, we have conducted experiments to quantify PA in the supernatants of cultures of B. anthracis Sterne strain, which is the strain used in the manufacture of the UK anthrax vaccine. Then, for the first time, we quantify PA production and degradation via mathematical modelling and Bayesian statistical techniques, making use of this new experimental data as well as two other independent published data sets. We propose a single mathematical model, in terms of delay differential equations (DDEs), which can explain the in vitro dynamics of all three data sets. Since we did not heat activate the B. anthracis spores prior to inoculation, germination occurred much slower in our experiments, allowing us to calibrate two additional parameters with respect to the other data sets. Our model is able to distinguish between natural PA decay and that triggered by bacteria via proteases. There is promising consistency between the different independent data sets for most of the parameter estimates. The quantitative characterisation of B. anthracis PA production and degradation obtained here will contribute towards the ambition to include a realistic description of toxin dynamics, the host immune response, and anti-toxin treatments in future mechanistic models of anthrax infection.","1229":"England has experienced a large outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, disproportionately affecting people from disadvantaged and ethnic minority communities. It is unclear how much of this excess is due to differences in exposure associated with structural inequalities. Here, we report from the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-2 (REACT-2) national study of over 100,000 people. After adjusting for test characteristics and re-weighting to the population, overall antibody prevalence is 6.0% (95% CI: 5.8-6.1). An estimated 3.4 million people had developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 by mid-July 2020. Prevalence is two- to three-fold higher among health and care workers compared with non-essential workers, and in people of Black or South Asian than white ethnicity, while age- and sex-specific infection fatality ratios are similar across ethnicities. Our results indicate that higher hospitalisation and mortality from COVID-19 in minority ethnic groups may reflect higher rates of infection rather than differential experience of disease or care.","1230":"Young black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) and young black transgender women (TGW) have experienced a stark disparity in HIV prevention and care. Resilience, collective resources to adapt stressors or adversities, may improve HIV prevention and care outcomes. The present study investigated the association of resilience-based factors with PrEP uptake and viral suppression from a socioecological perspective among YBMSM and young black TGW. Data were from the baseline cycle of the Neighborhoods and Networks (N2) Study, an ongoing cohort study of 16-34-year-old YBMSM and young black TGW in Chicago (n\u2009=\u2009324). Confidant network-level and neighborhood affiliation variables were created to measure the social-environmental context of resilience. All analyses were stratified by participants' HIV status (184 HIV-negative participants and 140 HIV-positive participants). Among HIV-negative participants, having a parental figure within an individual's confidant network was significantly associated with a greater likelihood of PrEP use. Among HIV-positive participants, confidant network members' awareness of an individual's HIV status was associated with viral suppression. Social support resources from confidant networks could improve HIV prevention and care engagement among YBMSM and young black TGW. Understanding the social and environmental contexts of resilience resource is critical for HIV prevention and care engagement.","1231":"We estimated that combined isolation and tracing strategies would reduce transmission more than mass testing or self-isolation alone: mean transmission reduction of 2% for mass random testing of 5% of the population each week, 29% for self-isolation alone of symptomatic cases within the household, 35% for self-isolation alone outside the household, 37% for self-isolation plus household quarantine, 64% for self-isolation and household quarantine with the addition of manual contact tracing of all contacts, 57% with the addition of manual tracing of acquaintances only, and 47% with the addition of app-based tracing only. If limits were placed on gatherings outside of home, school, or work, then manual contact tracing of acquaintances alone could have an effect on transmission reduction similar to that of detailed contact tracing. In a scenario where 1000 new symptomatic cases that met the definition to trigger contact tracing occurred per day, we estimated that, in most contact tracing strategies, 15\u2008000-41\u2008000 contacts would be newly quarantined each day.Consistent with previous modelling studies and country-specific COVID-19 responses to date, our analysis estimated that a high proportion of cases would need to self-isolate and a high proportion of their contacts to be successfully traced to ensure an effective reproduction number lower than 1 in the absence of other measures. If combined with moderate physical distancing measures, self-isolation and contact tracing would be more likely to achieve control of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission.For this mathematical modelling study, we used a model of individual-level transmission stratified by setting (household, work, school, or other) based on BBC Pandemic data from 40\u2008162 UK participants. We simulated the effect of a range of different testing, isolation, tracing, and physical distancing scenarios. Under optimistic but plausible assumptions, we estimated reduction in the effective reproduction number and the number of contacts that would be newly quarantined each day under different strategies.The isolation of symptomatic cases and tracing of contacts has been used as an early COVID-19 containment measure in many countries, with additional physical distancing measures also introduced as outbreaks have grown. To maintain control of infection while also reducing disruption to populations, there is a need to understand what combination of measures-including novel digital tracing approaches and less intensive physical distancing-might be required to reduce transmission. We aimed to estimate the reduction in transmission under different control measures across settings and how many contacts would be quarantined per day in different strategies for a given level of symptomatic case incidence.Wellcome Trust, UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, European Commission, Royal Society, Medical Research Council.","1232":"A dynamic transmission model was used to simulate mpox transmission in the DRC, stratified by age (15 years) and province. The model was used to simulate potential vaccination strategies, varying by age and region (endemic provinces, non-endemic provinces with historic cases, and all provinces) assessing the effect the strategies would have on deaths and cases in an epidemic year similar to 2023. In addition, we estimated the number of vaccine doses needed to implement each strategy.Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Canadian International Development Research Centre, US Department of Defense (Defense Threat Reduction Agency, Mpox Threat Reduction Network), Global Affairs Canada (Weapons Threat Reduction Program), US Department for Agriculture (Agriculture Research Service, Non-Assistance Cooperative Agreement).Without vaccination, our model predicted 14\u2009700 cases and 700 deaths from mpox over 365 days. Vaccinating 80% of all children younger than 5 years in endemic regions led to a 27% overall reduction in cases and a 43% reduction in deaths, requiring 10\u00b75 million vaccine doses. Vaccinating 80% of all children younger than 5 years in all regions led to a 29% reduction in cases and a 43% reduction in deaths, requiring 33\u00b71 million doses. Vaccinating 80% of children aged 15 years or younger in endemic provinces led to a 54% reduction in cases and a 71% reduction in deaths, requiring 26\u00b76 million doses.Mpox was first identified in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 1970. In 2023, a historic outbreak of mpox occurred in the country, continuing into 2024. Over 14\u2009000 cases and 600 deaths were reported in 2023 alone, representing a major increase from previous outbreaks. The modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine (brand names JYNNEOS, Imvamune, and Imvanex) was used in the 2022 mpox outbreak in the USA and Europe. However, at the time of the study, vaccination had not been made available in the DRC. We aimed to inform policy and decision makers on the potential benefits of, and resources needed, for mpox vaccination campaigns in the DRC by providing counterfactual scenarios evaluating the short-term effects of various vaccination strategies on mpox cases and deaths, if such a vaccination campaign had been undertaken before the 2023-24 outbreak.When resources are limited, vaccinating children aged 15 years or younger, or younger than 5 years, in endemic regions of the DRC would be the most efficient use of vaccines. Further research is needed to explore long-term effects of a one-time or recurrent vaccination campaign.","1233":"Effective control of schistosomiasis remains a challenging problem for endemic areas of the world. Given knowledge of the biology of transmission and past experience with mass drug administration (MDA) programs, it is important to critically evaluate the likelihood that MDA programs will achieve substantial reductions in Schistosoma prevalence. In implementing the World Health Organization Roadmap for Neglected Tropical Diseases it would useful for policymaking to model projections of the status of Schistosoma control in MDA-treated areas in the next 5-10 years.Calibrated mathematical models were used to project the effects of different frequency and coverage of MDA for schistosomiasis haematobia control in present-day endemic communities, taking into account uncertainties of parasite biology and input data. The modeling approach in this analysis was the Stratified Worm Burden model developed in our earlier works, calibrated using data from longitudinal S. haematobium control trials in Kenya.In a stable (stationary) ecosystem, Schistosoma reproduction and transmission are sufficiently robust that the process of human infection continues, even under pressure from aggressive MDA. MDA alone is unlikely to interrupt transmission, and once mass treatment is suspended, the prevalence of human infection is likely to rebound to pre-control levels over a period of 25-30 years. MDA success in achieving very low levels of infection prevalence is highly dependent on treatment coverage and frequency within the local human population, and requires that both adults and children be included in drug delivery coverage. Ultimately, supplemental snail control and significant improvements in sanitation will be required to achieve full control of schistosomiasis by elimination of ongoing Schistosoma transmission.Model-based simulations of MDA control in typical low-risk and higher-risk communities indicated that infection prevalence can be substantially reduced within 10\u00a0years only when there is a high degree of community participation (>70\u00a0%) with at least annual MDA. Significant risk for re-emergence of infection remains if MDA is suspended.","1234":"As Africa-wide malaria prevalence declines, an understanding of human movement patterns is essential to inform how best to target interventions. We fitted movement models to trip data from surveys conducted at 3-5 sites throughout each of Mali, Burkina Faso, Zambia and Tanzania. Two models were compared in terms of their ability to predict the observed movement patterns - a gravity model, in which movement rates between pairs of locations increase with population size and decrease with distance, and a radiation model, in which travelers are cumulatively \"absorbed\" as they move outwards from their origin of travel. The gravity model provided a better fit to the data overall and for travel to large populations, while the radiation model provided a better fit for nearby populations. One strength of the data set was that trips could be categorized according to traveler group - namely, women traveling with children in all survey countries and youth workers in Mali. For gravity models fitted to data specific to these groups, youth workers were found to have a higher travel frequency to large population centers, and women traveling with children a lower frequency. These models may help predict the spatial transmission of malaria parasites and inform strategies to control their spread.","1235":"The large spatial scale, geographical overlap, and similarities in transmission mode between the 1918 H1N1 influenza and 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemics together provide a novel opportunity to investigate relationships between transmission of two different diseases in the same location. To this end, we use initial exponential growth rates in a Bayesian hierarchical framework to estimate the basic reproductive number, R 0, of both disease outbreaks in a common set of 43 cities in the United States. By leveraging multiple epidemic time series across a large spatial area, we are able to better characterize the variation in R 0 across the United States. Additionally, we provide one of the first city-level comparisons of R 0 between these two pandemics and explore how demography and outbreak timing are related to R 0. Despite similarities in transmission modes and a common set of locations, R 0 estimates for COVID-19 were uncorrelated with estimates of pandemic influenza R 0 in the same cities. Also, the relationships between R 0 and key population or epidemic traits differed between diseases. For example, epidemics that started later tended to be less severe for COVID-19, while influenza epidemics exhibited an opposite pattern. Our results suggest that despite similarities between diseases, epidemics starting in the same location may differ markedly in their initial progression.","1236":"Understanding the build-up of immunity with successive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants and the epidemiological conditions that favor rapidly expanding epidemics will help facilitate future pandemic control. We analyzed high-resolution infection and serology data from two longitudinal household cohorts in South Africa to reveal high cumulative infection rates and durable cross-protective immunity conferred by prior infection in the pre-Omicron era. Building on the history of past exposures to different SARS-CoV-2 variants and vaccination in the more representative urban cohort given South Africa's high urbanization rate, we used mathematical models to explore the fitness advantage of the Omicron variant and its epidemic trajectory. Modelling suggests the Omicron wave likely infected a large fraction (44% - 81%) of the population, leaving a complex landscape of population immunity primed and boosted with antigenically distinct variants. We project that future SARS-CoV-2 resurgences are likely under a range of scenarios of viral characteristics, population contacts, and residual cross-protection.","1237":"Outpatient sarcoma clinics in Canada, the USA and Spain between May 2017 and April 2020. Survey data were entered into a study-specific database.The proportion of patients with extremity sarcoma who would be willing to participate in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that evaluates varying postoperative cancer surveillance regimens.V.To determine the proportion of patients with extremity sarcoma who would be willing to participate in a clinical trial in which they would be randomised to one of four different postoperative sarcoma surveillance regimens. Additionally, we assessed patients' perspectives on the burden of cancer care, factors that influence comfort with randomisation and the importance of cancer research.Patients with extremity sarcoma who had completed definitive treatment from seven clinics across Canada, the USA and Spain.Prospective, cross-sectional patient survey.One hundred thirty complete surveys were obtained. Respondents reported a wide range of burdens related to clinical care and surveillance. The majority of patients (85.5%) responded that they would agree to participate in a cancer surveillance RCT if eligible. The most common reason to participate was that they wanted to help future patients. Those that would decline to participate most commonly reported that participating in research would be too much of a burden for them at a time when they are already feeling overwhelmed. However, most patients agreed that cancer research will help doctors better understand and treat cancer.These results demonstrate that most participants would be willing to participate in an RCT that evaluates varying postoperative cancer surveillance regimens. Participants' motivation for trial participation included altruistic reasons to help future patients and deterrents to trial participation included the overwhelming burden of a cancer diagnosis. These results will help inform the development of patient-centred RCT protocols in sarcoma surveillance research.","1238":"Physical distancing has been the primary strategy to control COVID-19 in the United States. We used mobility data from a large, anonymized sample of smartphone users to assess the relationship between neighbourhood income and physical distancing during the pandemic. We found a strong gradient between neighbourhood income and physical distancing. Individuals in high-income neighbourhoods increased their days at home substantially more than individuals in low-income neighbourhoods did. Residents of low-income neighbourhoods were more likely to work outside the home, compared to residents in higher-income neighbourhoods, but were not more likely to visit locations such as supermarkets, parks and hospitals. Finally, we found that state orders were only associated with small increases in staying home in low-income neighbourhoods. Our findings indicate that people in lower-income neighbourhoods have faced barriers to physical distancing, particularly needing to work outside the home, and that state physical distancing policies have not mitigated these disparities.","1239":"We estimate the delay-adjusted all-cause excess deaths across 53 US jurisdictions. Using provisional data collected from September through December 2020, we first identify a common mean reporting delay of 2.8 weeks, whereas four jurisdictions have prolonged reporting delays compared to the others: Connecticut (mean 5.8 weeks), North Carolina (mean 10.4 weeks), Puerto Rico (mean 4.7 weeks) and West Virginia (mean 5.5 weeks). After adjusting for reporting delays, we estimate the percent change in all-cause excess mortality from March to December 2020 with range from 0.2 to 3.6 in Hawaii to 58.4 to 62.4 in New York City. Comparing the March-December with September-December 2020 periods, the highest increases in excess mortality are observed in South Dakota (36.9-54.0), North Dakota (33.9-50.7) and Missouri (27.8-33.9). Our findings indicate that analysis of provisional data requires caution in interpreting the death counts in recent weeks, while one needs also to account for heterogeneity in reporting delays of excess deaths among US jurisdictions.","1240":"A Markov cohort model was created to compare routine supplementation with calcium alone (RS), postoperative parathyroid hormone-based selective supplementation with calcium and calcitriol (SS), and no supplementation (NS) in asymptomatic patients. Patients could remain asymptomatic or develop symptomatic hypocalcemia, managed with outpatient oral supplementation or intravenous calcium infusion and administered either inpatient or outpatient. Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life years. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test model parameter assumptions.After total thyroidectomy, a preventative calcium supplementation strategy should be strongly considered. In this data-driven theoretical model, RS was the least costly option and resulted in an incremental gain in quality-adjusted life years.Symptomatic hypocalcemia is a common complication of total thyroidectomy. Management strategies include responsive treatment initiation for symptoms or prevention by routine or parathyroid hormone-directed calcium supplementation. The comparative cost-effectiveness of even the most often utilized strategies is unclear.RS was the preferred strategy, costing $329\/patient and resulting in 0.497 quality-adjusted life years, which was only marginally better compared to SS ($373 for 0.495 quality-adjusted life years). NS was most costly at $4,955 for 0.491 quality-adjusted life years. Preference for RS over SS was sensitive to the probability of developing symptoms and the probability of symptom treatment with intravenous supplementation. On probabilistic sensitivity analysis, RS was preferred in 75.4% of scenarios.","1241":"Saturation deficit is the indicator that better explains tick activity trends in Herat. Recent increments in reported CCHFV cases in this area are more likely explained by increased surveillance capacity instead of changes in the background transmission dynamics. Modelling suggests that clinical cases only represent 31% (95% CrI 28%-33%) of total infections in this area. Vaccination campaigns targeting humans would result in a much larger impact than livestock vaccination (266 vs 31 clinical cases averted respectively) and a more efficient option when assessed in courses per case averted (35 vs 431 respectively). Targeted vaccination of farmers is impactful and more efficient, resulting in 19 courses per case averted (95% CrI 7-62) compared to targeting the general population (35 courses 95% CrI 16-107).We developed a series of models of transmission amongst livestock, and spillover infection into humans. We use real-world human and animal data from a CCHFV endemic area in Afghanistan (Herat) to calibrate our models. We assess the value of environmental drivers as proxy indicators of vector activity, and select the best model using deviance information criteria. Finally we assess the impact of vaccination by simulating campaigns targeted to humans or livestock, and to high-risk subpopulations (i.e, farmers).Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a highly pathogenic virus for which a safe and effective vaccine is not yet available, despite being considered a priority emerging pathogen. Understanding transmission patterns and the use of potential effective vaccines are central elements of the future plan against this infection.CCHFV is endemic in Herat, and transmission cycles are well predicted by environmental drivers like saturation deficit. Vaccinating humans is likely to be more efficient and impactful than animals, and importantly targeted interventions to high risk groups like farmers can offer a more efficient approach to vaccine roll-out.","1242":"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) interventions among people who use drugs (PWUD) often have spillover, also known as interference or dissemination, which occurs when one participant's exposure affects another participant's outcome. PWUD are often members of networks defined by social, sexual, and drug-use partnerships and their receipt of interventions can affect other members in their network. For example, HIV interventions with possible spillover include educational training about HIV risk reduction, pre-exposure prophylaxis, or treatment as prevention. In turn, intervention effects frequently depend on the network structure, and intervention coverage levels and spillover can occur even if not measured in a study, possibly resulting in an underestimation of intervention effects. Recent methodological approaches were developed to assess spillover in the context of network-based studies. This tutorial provides an overview of different study designs for network-based studies and related methodological approaches for assessing spillover in each design. We also provide an overview of other important methodological issues in network studies, including causal influence in networks and missing data. Finally, we highlight applications of different designs and methods from studies of PWUD and conclude with an illustrative example from the Transmission Reduction Intervention Project (TRIP) in Athens, Greece.","1243":"\"Universal\" vaccines that could have multistrain and multiyear effectiveness are being developed. Their potential cost-effectiveness in geriatric populations is unknown.Universal vaccine use in older persons could be either cost effective or cost saving when universal vaccine parameters are within plausible ranges. However, if its effectiveness is substantially less than current vaccines, its use would probably not be favored in geriatric populations.A Markov model estimated effects of a theoretical universal influenza vaccine compared with available seasonal vaccines in hypothetical cohorts of U.S. 65+-year olds followed over a 5-year time horizon to capture potential multiyear protection. Outcomes included costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained and influenza cases avoided.Using hypothetical universal vaccine parameter values (cost $100, vaccine effectiveness 39%, uptake 64%, effectiveness duration 5 years), universal vaccine was less costly than seasonal influenza vaccination strategies. High-dose trivalent influenza vaccine, compared with universal vaccine, gained 0.0028 quality-adjusted life-years and cost $82 more, or $28,700 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Other seasonal vaccines were not favorable economically. Five-year influenza risk with universal vaccination was 32.3% under base case assumptions, compared with <30% with adjuvanted or high-dose vaccine use. In sensitivity analyses, universal vaccine was favored when uptake or vaccine effectiveness was greater than standard-dose influenza vaccine. If absolute universal vaccine effectiveness was 10% less than standard-dose vaccine, universal vaccine could be cost-saving but not more effective than other strategies. Universal vaccine was not favored if its effectiveness duration was <3 years.","1244":"Zika virus (ZIKV) belongs to a class of neurotropic viruses that have the ability to cause congenital infection, which can result in microcephaly or fetal demise. Recently, the RNA-binding protein Musashi-1 (Msi1), which mediates the maintenance and self-renewal of stem cells and acts as a translational regulator, has been associated with promoting ZIKV replication, neurotropism, and pathology. Msi1 predominantly binds to single-stranded motifs in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of RNA that contain a UAG trinucleotide in their core. We systematically analyzed the properties of Musashi binding elements (MBEs) in the 3'UTR of flaviviruses with a thermodynamic model for RNA folding. Our results indicate that MBEs in ZIKV 3'UTRs occur predominantly in unpaired, single-stranded structural context, thus corroborating experimental observations by a biophysical model of RNA structure formation. Statistical analysis and comparison with related viruses show that ZIKV MBEs are maximally accessible among mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Our study addresses the broader question of whether other emerging arboviruses can cause similar neurotropic effects through the same mechanism in the developing fetus by establishing a link between the biophysical properties of viral RNA and teratogenicity. Moreover, our thermodynamic model can explain recent experimental findings and predict the Msi1-related neurotropic potential of other viruses.","1245":"While use of convalescent plasma (CP) in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been inconsistent, CP has the potential to reduce excess morbidity and mortality in future pandemics. Given constraints on CP supply, decisions surrounding the allocation of CP must be made.Using a discrete time stochastic compartmental model, we simulated implementation of four potential allocation strategies: administering CP to individuals in early hospitalization with COVID-19; administering CP to individuals in outpatient settings; administering CP to hospitalized individuals and administering any remaining CP to outpatient individuals; and administering CP in both settings while prioritizing outpatient individuals. We examined final size of SARS-CoV-2 infections, peak and cumulative hospitalizations, and cumulative deaths under each of the allocation scenarios over 180-day period. We compared cost per weighted health benefit under each strategy.Convalescent plasma allocation strategy should be determined by the relative priority of averting deaths, infections, or hospitalizations. Under conditions considered, mixed allocation strategies (allocating CP to both outpatient and hospitalized individuals) resulted in larger percentage of infections and deaths averted than administering CP in a single setting.Prioritizing administration to patients in early hospitalization, with remaining plasma administered in outpatient setting, resulted in the highest reduction in mortality, averting on average 15% more COVID-19 deaths than administering to hospitalized individuals alone (95% CI [11% - 18%]). Prioritizing administration to outpatients, with remaining plasma administered to hospitalized individuals, had the highest percentage of hospitalizations averted (22% [21% - 23%] higher than administering to hospitalized individuals alone).","1246":" hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers. Overall, immune responses were lower among those \u226565\u00a0years of age than those <65\u00a0years. Among those \u226565\u00a0years there were no significant differences between frail and non-frail individuals in seroprotection or seroconversion for any influenza strain. Frail individuals <65\u00a0years of age compared with non-frail individuals were more likely to be seroprotected and to seroconvert post vaccination. Linear regression models show the same pattern of significant differences between frail and non-frail for those <65\u00a0years but no significant differences between frailty groups for those \u226565\u00a0years. Additional research may elucidate the reasons for the differences observed between younger frail and non-frail adults.","1247":"Many studies report the high prevalence of multiply drug-resistant (MDR) strains. Because MDR infections are often significantly harder and more expensive to treat, they represent a growing public health threat. However, for different pathogens, different underlying mechanisms are traditionally used to explain these observations, and it is unclear whether each bacterial taxon has its own mechanism(s) for multidrug resistance or whether there are common mechanisms between distantly related pathogens. In this review, we provide a systematic overview of the causes of the excess of MDR infections and define testable predictions made by each hypothetical mechanism, including experimental, epidemiological, population genomic, and other tests of these hypotheses. Better understanding the cause(s) of the excess of MDR is the first step to rational design of more effective interventions to prevent the origin and\/or proliferation of MDR.","1248":" pools in coastal LA, where temperature variation more frequently traversed the narrow transitional temperature range compared to warmer inland locations. This contributed to a pronounced expansion in the geographical distribution of human cases near the coast during warmer-than-average periods. Our findings suggest that transcritical variation may influence the sensitivity of transmission to climate warming, and that especially vulnerable locations may occur where present climatic fluctuations traverse critical temperature thresholds.","1249":"We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern. The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403-540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 18-25) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average. We estimated the R0 of 2019-nCoV at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49-2.63).In December 2019, an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of foreign countries. The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV.We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth. The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation. We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R0.The under-reporting was likely to have occurred during the first half of January 2020 and should be considered in future investigation.","1250":"The interaction between nonlinearity and seasonal forcing in childhood infectious diseases often leads to multiyear cycles with large amplitude. Regular biennial cycles in particular were observed in measles reports throughout the world. The objective of this paper is to understand the mechanism of such biennial cycles, especially the conditions under which the large amplitude biennial oscillation might appear. It is proposed that such biennial cycles are caused by parametric resonance, which might occur when varying the parameter at a frequency close to twice the natural frequency of the system. The analysis is carried out by solving an SIR model semi-analytically using method of multiple scales (MMS). This analysis shows how parametric resonance occurs due to the interaction between nonlinearity and periodic forcing. Using the MMS solution, the boundary between the resonance region and the non-resonance region in the parameter space is obtained. The effects of different parameters on the triggering of parametric resonance are studied, such as transmission rate, recovery rate, birth rate and amplitude of seasonality. The effects of stochasticity on the onset of parametric resonance are also studied.","1251":" parasites, with normal hemoglobin digestion and growth restored in the presence of carbon monoxide, a gaseous antisickling agent. Modeling of growth inhibition and sequestration revealed that HbS polymerization-induced growth inhibition following cytoadherence is the critical driver of the reduced parasite densities observed in malaria infections of individuals with AS. We conclude that the protective effect of AS derives largely from effective sequestration of infected RBCs into the hypoxic microcirculation.","1252":"It has previously been shown that, conditional on its fixation, the time to fixation of a semi-dominant deleterious autosomal mutation in a randomly mating population is the same as that of an advantageous mutation. This result implies that deleterious mutations could generate selective sweep-like effects. Although their fixation probabilities greatly differ, the much larger input of deleterious relative to beneficial mutations suggests that this phenomenon could be important. We here examine how the fixation of mildly deleterious mutations affects levels and patterns of polymorphism at linked sites - both in the presence and absence of interference amongst deleterious mutations - and how this class of sites may contribute to divergence between-populations and species. We find that, while deleterious fixations are unlikely to represent a significant proportion of outliers in polymorphism-based genomic scans within populations, minor shifts in the frequencies of deleterious mutations can influence the proportions of private variants and the value of FST after a recent population split. As sites subject to deleterious mutations are necessarily found in functional genomic regions, interpretations in terms of recurrent positive selection may require reconsideration.","1253":"In total, 598 people were included in the analysis. Over 50% of the study population screened positive for ROD (CES-D score \u226516) and over 25% screened positive for risk of major depressive disorder (CES-D score \u226522) at all time points. Lower age, female gender, alcohol use, stress and prior mental health diagnoses were all associated with greater odds of screening positive for ROD in multivariable models.Although the risk factors associated with screening positive for ROD are similar to those in other military and civilian populations, the proportion screening positive exceeds previously reported prevalence. This suggests that shipboard deployment or factors associated with shipboard deployment may present particular stressors or increase the likelihood of depressive symptoms.Depression is a leading cause of healthcare use and risk for suicide among US military personnel. Depression is not well characterised over the shipboard deployment cycle, and personnel undergo less screening than with land-based deployments, making early identification less likely.To determine the demographic and behavioural risk factors associated with screening positive for risk of depression (ROD) across the shipboard deployment cycle.The authors are military service members (or employees of the US Government).

The model consists of non-injection drug users as well as low-and high-risk injection drug users (IDUs). The model further incorporates the movement of these individuals between large metro, suburban and rural areas. The model parameters were estimated by fitting the model to the 2008-2013 disease prevalence data for non-IDUs obtained from the Agency for Healthcare and Research and Quality (AHRQ), as well as the 2009-2013 Census Bureau data for the number of individuals migrating between three different counties in Kansas. Sensitivity analysis was implemented to determine the parameters with the most significant impact on the total number of infected individuals; the transmission probability, recovery rates, and positive behavioral change parameter for the subgroup have the most significant effect on the number of infected individuals. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the parameters in the different areas was the same when the areas are disconnected. When the areas are connected, the parameters in large-metro areas were the most sensitive, and the rural areas were least sensitive. The result shows that to effectively control the disease across the large metro, suburban and rural areas, it is best to focus on controlling both behavior and disease in the large metro area as this has a trickle-down effect to the other places. However, controlling behavior and disease at the same time in all the areas will lead to the elimination of the disease.","1255":"Despite rapid and ongoing vaccine and therapeutic development, SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve and evade, presenting a need for next-generation diverse therapeutic modalities. Here we show that nurse sharks immunized with SARS-CoV-2 recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD),\u00a0RBD-ferritin (RFN), or spike protein ferritin nanoparticle (SpFN) immunogens elicit a set of new antigen receptor antibody (IgNAR) molecules that target two non-overlapping conserved epitopes on the spike RBD. Representative shark antibody variable NAR-Fc chimeras (ShAbs) targeting either of the two epitopes mediate cell-effector functions, with high affinity to all SARS-CoV-2 viral variants of concern, including the divergent Omicron strains. The ShAbs potently cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 WA-1, Alpha, Beta, Delta, Omicron BA.1 and BA.5, and SARS-CoV-1 pseudoviruses, and confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in the K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. Structural definition of the RBD-ShAb01-ShAb02 complex enabled design and production of multi-specific nanobodies with enhanced neutralization capacity, and picomolar affinity to divergent sarbecovirus clade 1a, 1b and 2 RBD molecules. These shark nanobodies represent potent immunotherapeutics both for current use, and future sarbecovirus pandemic preparation.","1256":"To quantify the proportion of people living with HIV (PLWH) with other tuberculosis (TB) risk factors that completed the latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) care cascade and describe factors associated with attrition. The care cascade was defined as follows: (1) receipt of an LTBI test and result, (2) initiation of LTBI treatment and (3) completion of LTBI treatment.Our primary outcome was the number and proportion of participants who completed each stage of the cascade and the factors associated with completing each stage. Our secondary outcomes were differences between participants tested with an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) versus tuberculin skin test and differences between participants who tested positive versus negative for LTBI.Reactivation of LTBI remains a large source of active TB disease in the USA. PLWH and those who use substances are at greater risk and are harder to engage and retain in care.Prospective cohort study.Participants enrolled in a Boston cohort of PLWH from 2012 to 2014.Although the majority completed LTBI testing, our findings warrant further investigation in a larger cohort to better understand factors that lead to suboptimal treatment initiation and completion in a low-burden country.Only 189 of 219 (86.3%) participants completed testing. Five of the 11 with LTBI initiated and three completed treatment. Participants tested with an IGRA were more likely to complete testing (OR 3.87, 95% CI 1.05 to 14.30) while among participants successfully tested, being foreign-born was associated with a positive test result (OR 3.95; 95% CI 1.13 to 13.77).","1257":"We consider a network design problem (NDP) under random demand with unknown distribution for which only a small number of observations are known. We design arc capacities in the first stage and optimize single-commodity network flows after realizing the demand in the second stage. The objective is to minimize the total cost of allocating arc capacities, flowing commodities, and penalty for unmet demand. We formulate a distributionally robust NDP (DR-NDP) by constructing an ambiguity set of the unknown demand distribution based on marginal moment information, to minimize the worst-case total cost over all possible distributions. Approximating polynomials with piecewise-linear functions, we reformulate DR-NDP as a mixed-integer linear program optimized via a cutting-plane algorithm. We test diverse network instances to compare DR-NDP with a stochastic programming approach, a deterministic benchmark model, and a robust NDP formulation. Our results demonstrate adequate robustness of optimal DR-NDP solutions and how they perform under varying demand, modeling parameter, network, and cost settings. The results highlight potential niche uses of DR-NDP in data-scarce contexts.","1258":"Incentives are a useful tool in encouraging healthy behavior as part of public health initiatives. However, there remains concern about motivation crowd out-a decline in levels of motivation to undertake a behavior to below baseline levels after incentives have been removed-and few public health studies have assessed for motivation crowd out. Here, we assess the feasibility of identifying motivation crowd out following a lottery to promote participation in a Chagas disease vector control campaign. We look for evidence of crowd out in subsequent participation in the same behavior, a related behavior, and an unrelated behavior. We identified potential motivation crowd out for the same behavior, but not for related behavior or unrelated behaviors after lottery incentives are removed. Despite some limitations, we conclude that motivation crowd out is feasible to assess in large-scale trials of incentives.","1259":"Erlang differential equation models of epidemic processes provide more realistic disease-class transition dynamics from susceptible (S) to exposed (E) to infectious (I) and removed (R) categories than the ubiquitous SEIR model. The latter is itself is at one end of the spectrum of Erlang SE[Formula: see text]I[Formula: see text]R models with [Formula: see text] concatenated E compartments and [Formula: see text] concatenated I compartments. Discrete-time models, however, are computationally much simpler to simulate and fit to epidemic outbreak data than continuous-time differential equations, and are also much more readily extended to include demographic and other types of stochasticity. Here we formulate discrete-time deterministic analogs of the Erlang models, and their stochastic extension, based on a time-to-go distributional principle. Depending on which distributions are used (e.g. discretized Erlang, Gamma, Beta, or Uniform distributions), we demonstrate that our formulation represents both a discretization of Erlang epidemic models and generalizations thereof. We consider the challenges of fitting SE[Formula: see text]I[Formula: see text]R models and our discrete-time analog to data (the recent outbreak of Ebola in Liberia). We demonstrate that the latter performs much better than the former; although confining fits to strict SEIR formulations reduces the numerical challenges, but sacrifices best-fit likelihood scores by at least 7%.","1260":"We studied 31 US healthcare facilities to characterize trends in mycobacterial testing. During 2009-2015, testing for acid-fast bacilli increased 3.2% annually, and prevalence of pathogenic nontuberculous mycobacteria increased 4.5% annually. These increases were highest for subpopulations at high risk of infection, including older women, Asians, and patients with concurrent conditions.","1261":"Human populations show rich cultural diversity. Underpinning this diversity of tools, rituals, and cultural norms are complex interactions between cultural evolutionary and demographic processes. Most models of cultural change assume that individuals use the same learning modes and methods throughout their lives. However, empirical data on 'learning life histories'-the balance of dominant modes of learning (for example, learning from parents, peers, or unrelated elders) throughout an individual's lifetime-suggest that age structure may play a crucial role in determining learning modes and cultural evolutionary trajectories. Thus, studied in isolation, demographic and cultural evolutionary models show only part of the picture. This paper describes a mathematical and computational framework that combines demographic and cultural evolutionary methods. Using this general framework, we examine interactions between the ways in which culture is spread throughout an individual's lifetime and cultural change across generations. We show that including demographic structure alongside cultural dynamics can help to explain domain-specific patterns of cultural evolution that are a persistent feature of cultural data, and can shed new light on rare but significant demographic events.","1262":"To identify facilities at risk of receiving patients colonized or infected with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), we developed an interactive web-based interface for visualization of patient-sharing networks among healthcare facilities in Tennessee, USA. Using hospital discharge data and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' claims and Minimum Data Set, we constructed networks among hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. Networks included direct and indirect transfers, which accounted for <365 days in the community outside of facility admissions. Authorized users can visualize a facility of interest and tailor visualizations by year, network dataset, length of time in the community, and minimum number of transfers. The interface visualizes the facility of interest with its connected facilities that receive or send patients, the number of interfacility transfers, and facilities at risk of receiving transfers from the facility of interest. This tool will help other health departments enhance their MDRO outbreak responses.","1263":"Out of 184 councils, 28 were in the very low stratum (12% of the population), 34 in the low stratum (28% of population), 49 in the moderate stratum (23% of population) and 73 in the high stratum (37% of population). Geographically, most of the councils in the low and very low strata were situated in the central corridor running from the north-east to south-west parts of the country, whilst the areas in the moderate to high strata were situated in the north-west and south-east regions.). Scores were assigned to each risk group per indicator per council and the total score was used to determine the overall risk strata of all councils.A stratification approach based on multiple routine and survey malaria information was developed. This pragmatic approach can be rapidly reproduced without the use of sophisticated statistical methods, hence, lies within the scope of national malaria programmes across Africa.Recent malaria control efforts in mainland Tanzania have led to progressive changes in the prevalence of malaria infection in children, from 18.1% (2008) to 7.3% (2017). As the landscape of malaria transmission changes, a sub-national stratification becomes crucial for optimized cost-effective implementation of interventions. This paper describes the processes, data and outputs of the approach used to produce a simplified, pragmatic malaria risk stratification of 184 councils in mainland Tanzania.","1264":"Infectious disease modelling can serve as a powerful tool for situational awareness and decision support for policy makers. However, COVID-19 modelling efforts faced many challenges, from poor data quality to changing policy and human behaviour. To extract practical insight from the large body of COVID-19 modelling literature available, we provide a narrative review with a systematic approach that quantitatively assessed prospective, data-driven modelling studies of COVID-19 in the USA. We analysed 136 papers, and focused on the aspects of models that are essential for decision makers. We have documented the forecasting window, methodology, prediction target, datasets used, and geographical resolution for each study. We also found that a large fraction of papers did not evaluate performance (25%), express uncertainty (50%), or state limitations (36%). To remedy some of these identified gaps, we recommend the adoption of the EPIFORGE 2020 model reporting guidelines and creating an information-sharing system that is suitable for fast-paced infectious disease outbreak science.","1265":"Researchers increasingly use social contact data to inform models for infectious disease spread with the aim of guiding effective policies about disease prevention and control. In this article, we undertake a systematic review of the study design, statistical analyses, and outcomes of the many social contact surveys that have been published.We systematically searched PubMed and Web of Science for articles regarding social contact surveys. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines as closely as possible.We found that the overall features of the contact patterns were remarkably robust across several countries, and irrespective of the study details. By considering the most common approach in each aspect of design (e.g., sampling schemes, data collection, definition of contact), we could identify recommendations for future contact data surveys that may be used to facilitate comparison between studies.In total, we identified 64 social contact surveys, with more than 80% of the surveys conducted in high-income countries. Study settings included general population (58%), schools or universities (37%), and health care\/conference\/research institutes (5%). The largest number of studies did not focus on a specific age group (38%), whereas others focused on adults (32%) or children (19%). Retrospective (45%) and prospective (41%) designs were used most often with 6% using both for comparison purposes. The definition of a contact varied among surveys, e.g., a nonphysical contact may require conversation, close proximity, or both. We identified age, time schedule (e.g., weekday\/weekend), and household size as relevant determinants of contact patterns across a large number of studies.","1266":"We combined field-based data with mathematical modeling to estimate the effectiveness of smartphone-enabled COVID-19 exposure notification in Pennsylvania, USA. We estimated that digital notifications potentially averted 7-69 cases\/1,000 notifications during November 8, 2020-January 2, 2021. Greater use and increased compliance could increase the effectiveness of digital notifications.","1267":"Our study explored the patterns of bovine brucellosis dissemination in Minas Gerais state, Brazil, by examining data on passive surveillance of bovine brucellosis cases from the Instituto Mineiro de Agropecuaria (IMA) (Animal Health Authority), as well as cattle population and bovine brucellosis testing, from 2011 to 2018 by means of a spatiotemporal analysis. We plotted cases, populations and testing distributions and performed spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I test) and local indicators of spatial autocorrelation (LISA) analyses. Moreover, we assessed the correlation of the spatial distribution and the compiled data (brucellosis cases, cattle populations, and brucellosis testing) by Lee's test. Our results showed that bovine brucellosis cases occurred mainly in the Tri\u00e2ngulo Mineiro, Alto Parana\u00edba and Northwest regions, which reported cases in all analyzed years (2011 to 2018). The cattle population of Minas Gerais was concentrated in the same regions as bovine brucellosis cases, and the performed tests through the analyzed years (2011 to 2018). Moran's I test results of the case data showed significant spatial autocorrelation in 2011, 2015 and 2018 (p value < 0.05), and from 2011 to 2018, the population and testing data were also significant in Moran's I test (p value < 0.01). The results of cluster analysis (LISA) of cases showed clusters mainly in the Tri\u00e2ngulo Mineiro, Alto Parana\u00edba, Northwest and South regions in 2011, 2015 and 2018. The local clusters for cattle populations and brucellosis testing were also observed in the same regions as bovine brucellosis cases in all years (2011 to 2018). The correlation results between clusters (Lee's test) were 0.22 (p value < 0.01) in 2011, 0.15 (p value < 0.01) in 2015 and 0.43 (p value <0.01) in 2018 between cases and populations, and 0.25 (p value <0.01) in 2011, 0.14 (p value <0.01) in 2015 and 0.38 (p value < 0.01) in 2018 for testing and cases. Therefore, our results showed that brucellosis cases were distributed together with cattle populations and brucellosis testing data, indicating that brucellosis in cattle in Minas Gerais state is being identified where there are more animals and where more tests are performed.","1268":"MLST (multi-locus sequence typing) is a classic technique for genotyping bacteria, widely applied for pathogen outbreak surveillance. Traditionally, MLST is based on identifying sequence types from a small number of housekeeping genes. With the increasing availability of whole-genome sequencing data, MLST methods have evolved towards larger typing schemes, based on a few hundred genes [core genome MLST (cgMLST)] to a few thousand genes [whole genome MLST (wgMLST)]. Such large-scale MLST schemes have been shown to provide a finer resolution and are increasingly used in various contexts such as hospital outbreaks or foodborne pathogen outbreaks. This methodological shift raises new computational challenges, especially given the large size of the schemes involved. Very few available MLST callers are currently capable of dealing with large MLST schemes. We introduce MentaLiST, a new MLST caller, based on a k-mer voting algorithm and written in the Julia language, specifically designed and implemented to handle large typing schemes. We test it on real and simulated data to show that MentaLiST is faster than any other available MLST caller while providing the same or better accuracy, and is capable of dealing with MLST schemes with up to thousands of genes while requiring limited computational resources. MentaLiST source code and easy installation instructions using a Conda package are available at https:\/\/github.com\/WGS-TB\/MentaLiST.","1269":" \u00a0is not identifiable.

This trial showed that mass azithromycin distributions may propagate antibiotic resistance. (Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02047981.).Over the entire 48-month period, the mean (\u00b1SD) coverage was 86.6\u00b112% in the villages that received placebo and 83.2\u00b116.4% in the villages that received azithromycin. A total of 3232 samples were collected during the entire trial period; of the samples obtained at the 48-month monitoring visit, 546 samples from 15 villages that received placebo and 504 from 14 villages that received azithromycin were analyzed. Determinants of macrolide resistance were higher in the azithromycin group than in the placebo group: 7.4 times as high (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.0 to 16.7) at 36 months and 7.5 times as high (95% CI, 3.8 to 23.1) at 48 months. Continued mass azithromycin distributions also selected for determinants of nonmacrolide resistance, including resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, an antibiotic class prescribed frequently in this region of Africa.Mass distribution of azithromycin to preschool children twice yearly for 2 years has been shown to reduce childhood mortality in sub-Saharan Africa but at the cost of amplifying macrolide resistance. The effects on the gut resistome, a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance genes in the body, of twice-yearly administration of azithromycin for a longer period are unclear.We investigated the gut resistome of children after they received twice-yearly distributions of azithromycin for 4 years. In the Niger site of the MORDOR trial, we enrolled 30 villages in a concurrent trial in which they were randomly assigned to receive mass distribution of either azithromycin or placebo, offered to all children 1 to 59 months of age every 6 months for 4 years. Rectal swabs were collected at baseline, 36 months, and 48 months for analysis of the participants' gut resistome. The primary outcome was the ratio of macrolide-resistance determinants in the azithromycin group to those in the placebo group at 48 months.","1273":"Black sexually minoritized men (SMM) and transgender women (TW) are subgroups with lower rates of substance use and comparable rates of condom use relative to White SMM and TW yet experience heightened vulnerability to HIV. This study sought to explore associations of substance use, including sex-drug use (i.e., drug or alcohol use during sex to enhance sex), and condomless sex among Black SMM and TW. Data were collected from Black SMM and TW living in Chicago, Illinois, enrolled in the Neighborhoods and Networks (N2) cohort study, from November 2018 to April 2019. We used bivariate analyses followed by a multilevel egocentric network analysis to identify factors associated with condomless sex. We conducted Spearman correlation coefficients to examine correlations between pairs of sex-drugs to enhance sex. We used a bipartite network analysis to identify correlates of sex-drug use and condomless sex. A total of 352 Black SMM and TW (egos) provided information about 933 sexual partners (alters). Of respondents, 45% reported condomless sex and 61% reported sex-drug use. In unadjusted analyses, marijuana (34%) and cocaine\/crack (5%) sex-drug use were associated with condomless sex (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Condomless sex was positively associated with sex-polydrug use, or the use of 2+\u2009drugs or 1 drug and alcohol (OR\u2009=\u20091.48; 95% CI: 1.02-2.14; p\u2009=\u20090.039), and negatively associated with sharing an HIV-negative serostatus with a sexual partner (OR\u2009=\u20090.57; 95% CI: 0.33-0.98; p\u2009=\u20090.041), having a different HIV serostatus with a sexual partner (OR\u2009=\u20090.37; 95% CI: 0.21-0.64; p\u2009<\u20090.001) or not knowing the HIV serostatus of a sexual partner (OR\u2009=\u20090.47; 95% CI: 0.26-0.84; p\u2009=\u20090.011). The following pairs of sex-polydrug use had Spearman correlation coefficients higher than 0.3: marijuana and alcohol, ecstasy and alcohol, cocaine\/crack and ecstasy, and methamphetamine and poppers (p\u2009<\u20090.05). HIV prevention interventions for Black SMM and TW designed to reduce HIV transmission through egocentric sexual networks could address sex-drug use through sex-positive and pleasure-centered harm reduction strategies and provide and promote biomedical prevention and care options at supraoptimal levels.","1274":"Human mobility, both short and long term, are important considerations in the study of numerous systems. Economic and technological advances have led to a more interconnected global community, further increasing the need for considerations of human mobility. While data on human mobility are better recorded in many developed countries, availability of such data remains limited in many low- and middle-income countries around the world, particularly at the fine temporal and spatial scales required by many applications. In this study, we used 5-year census-based internal migration microdata for 32 departments in Colombia (i.e., Admin-1 level) to develop a novel spatial interaction modeling approach for estimating migration, at a finer spatial scale, among the 1,122 municipalities in the country (i.e., Admin-2 level). Our modeling approach addresses a significant lack of migration data at administrative unit levels finer than those at which migration data are typically recorded. Due to the widespread availability of census-based migration microdata at the Admin-1 level, our modeling approach opens up for the possibilities of modeling migration patterns at Admin-2 and Admin-3 levels across many other countries where such data are currently lacking.","1275":"Dengue is a vector-borne viral disease of humans that endemically circulates in many tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Infection with dengue can result in a range of disease outcomes. A considerable amount of research has sought to improve our understanding of this variation in disease outcomes and to identify predictors of severe disease. Contributing to this research, patterns of viral load in dengue infected patients have been quantified, with analyses indicating that peak viral load levels, rates of viral load decline, and time to peak viremia are useful predictors of severe disease. Here, we take a complementary approach to understanding patterns of clinical manifestation and inter-individual variation in viral load dynamics. Specifically, we statistically fit mathematical within-host models of dengue to individual-level viral load data to test virological and immunological hypotheses explaining inter-individual variation in dengue viral load. We choose between alternative models using model selection criteria to determine which hypotheses are best supported by the data. We first show that the cellular immune response plays an important role in regulating viral load in secondary dengue infections. We then provide statistical support for the process of antibody-dependent enhancement (but not original antigenic sin) in the development of severe disease in secondary dengue infections. Finally, we show statistical support for serotype-specific differences in viral infectivity rates, with infectivity rates of dengue serotypes 2 and 3 exceeding those of serotype 1. These results contribute to our understanding of dengue viral load patterns and their relationship to the development of severe dengue disease. They further have implications for understanding how dengue transmissibility may depend on the immune status of infected individuals and the identity of the infecting serotype.","1276":"Solid tumors, especially those with aberrant MYCN activation, often harbor an immunosuppressive microenvironment to fuel malignant growth and trigger treatment resistance. Despite this knowledge, there are no effective strategies to tackle this problem. We found that chemokine-like factor (CKLF) is highly expressed by various solid tumor cells and transcriptionally up-regulated by MYCN. Using the MYCN-driven high-risk neuroblastoma as a model system, we demonstrated that as early as the premalignant stage, tumor cells secrete CKLF to attract CCR4-expressing CD4+ cells, inducing immunosuppression and tumor aggression. Genetic depletion of CD4+ T regulatory cells abolishes the immunorestrictive and protumorigenic effects of CKLF. Our work supports that disrupting CKLF-mediated cross-talk between tumor and CD4+ suppressor cells represents a promising immunotherapeutic approach to battling MYCN-driven tumors.","1277":"Jean-Paul Chretien and colleagues argue that recent Ebola and Zika virus outbreaks highlight the importance of data sharing in scientific research.","1278":"86\/567 (15.2%) of household\/social contacts and 12\/122 (9.8%) of healthcare worker contacts acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection. Exposure to two suspected index cases (versus one) significantly increased risk for both household\/social contacts (RR 1.86) and healthcare workers (RR 8.18). Increased contact time also increased risk for healthcare workers (3-12 hours: RR 7.82, >12 hours: RR 11.81, versus \u22642 hours), but not for household\/social contacts. County incidence did not impact risk.Transmission rates after exposure to a SARS-COV-2-positive individual within households and healthcare settings varies significantly between studies. Variability in the extent of exposure and community SARS-CoV-2 incidence may contribute to differences in observed rates.We examined risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a randomized controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine as post-exposure prophylaxis. Study procedures included standardized questionnaires at enrollment and daily self-collection of mid-turbinate swabs for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. County-level incidence was modeled using federally sourced data. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using modified Poisson regression.In our study, increased exposure to SARS-CoV-2 within household or health care settings led to higher risk of infection, but elevated community incidence did not. This reinforces the importance of interventions to decrease transmission in close contact settings.","1279":"The urban-rural designation has been an important risk factor in infectious disease epidemiology. Many studies rely on a politically determined dichotomization of rural versus urban spaces, which fails to capture the complex mosaic of infrastructural, social and environmental factors driving risk. Such evaluation is especially important for Plasmodium transmission and malaria disease. To improve targeting of anti-malarial interventions, a continuous composite measure of urbanicity using spatially-referenced data was developed to evaluate household-level malaria risk from a house-to-house survey of children in Malawi.Children from 7564 households from eight districts throughout Malawi were tested for presence of Plasmodium parasites through finger-prick blood sampling and slide microscopy. A survey questionnaire was administered and latitude and longitude coordinates were recorded for each household. Distances from households to features associated with high and low levels of development (health facilities, roads, rivers, lakes) and population density were used to produce a principal component analysis (PCA)-based composite measure for all centroid locations of a fine geo-spatial grid covering Malawi. Regression methods were used to test associations of the urbanicity measure against Plasmodium infection status and to predict parasitaemia risk for all locations in Malawi.Infection probability declined with increasing urbanicity. The new urbanicity metric was more predictive than either a governmentally defined rural\/urban dichotomous variable or a population density variable. One reason for this was that 23% of cells within politically defined rural areas exhibited lower risk, more like those normally associated with \"urban\" locations.In addition to increasing predictive power, the new continuous urbanicity metric provided a clearer mechanistic understanding than the dichotomous urban\/rural designations. Such designations often ignore urban-like, low-risk pockets within traditionally rural areas, as were found in Malawi, along with rural-like, potentially high-risk environments within urban areas. This method of characterizing urbanicity can be applied to other infectious disease processes in rapidly urbanizing contexts.","1280":"The vision of personalized medicine is to identify interventions that maintain or restore a person's health based on their individual biology. Medical digital twins, computational models that integrate a wide range of health-related data about a person and can be dynamically updated, are a key technology that can help guide medical decisions. Such medical digital twin models can be high-dimensional, multi-scale, and stochastic. To be practical for healthcare applications, they often need to be simplified into low-dimensional surrogate models that can be used for optimal design of interventions. This paper introduces surrogate modeling algorithms for the purpose of optimal control applications. As a use case, we focus on agent-based models (ABMs), a common model type in biomedicine for which there are no readily available optimal control algorithms. By deriving surrogate models that are based on systems of ordinary differential equations, we show how optimal control methods can be employed to compute effective interventions, which can then be lifted back to a given ABM. The relevance of the methods introduced here extends beyond medical digital twins to other complex dynamical systems.","1281":"Preventing chronic diseases is an essential aspect of medical care. To prevent chronic diseases, physicians focus on monitoring their risk factors and prescribing the necessary medication. The optimal monitoring policy depends on the patient's risk factors and demographics. Monitoring too frequently may be unnecessary and costly; on the other hand, monitoring the patient infrequently means the patient may forgo needed treatment and experience adverse events related to the disease. We propose a finite horizon and finite-state Markov decision process to define monitoring policies. To build our Markov decision process, we estimate stochastic models based on longitudinal observational data from electronic health records for a large cohort of patients seen in the national U.S. Veterans Affairs health system. We use our model to study policies for whether or when to assess the need for cholesterol-lowering medications. We further use our model to investigate the role of gender and race on optimal monitoring policies.","1282":"Many individually randomized group treatment (IRGT) trials randomly assign individuals to study arms but deliver treatments via shared agents, such as therapists, surgeons, or trainers. Post-randomization interactions induce correlations in outcome measures between participants sharing the same agent. Agents can be nested in or crossed with trial arm, and participants may interact with a single agent or with multiple agents. These complications have led to ambiguity in choice of models but there have been no systematic efforts to identify appropriate analytic models for these study designs. To address this gap, we undertook a simulation study to examine the performance of candidate analytic models in the presence of complex clustering arising from multiple membership, single membership, and single agent settings, in both nested and crossed designs and for a continuous outcome. With nested designs, substantial type I error rate inflation was observed when analytic models did not account for multiple membership and when analytic model weights characterizing the association with multiple agents did not match the data generating mechanism. Conversely, analytic models for crossed designs generally maintained nominal type I error rates unless there was notable imbalance in the number of participants that interact with each agent.","1283":"Overall, 39.87% of CMC experienced\u2009\u2265\u20091 hospitalization in the past 12 months. CMC with higher hospitalization risk were dependent on respiratory or neurological\/neuromuscular medical devices, not non-Hispanic White, and demonstrated higher healthcare utilization. Interview findings contextualized efforts to reduce hospitalizations, and suggested adaptations related to capacity and willingness to provide complex care for CMC and their families.This mixed-methods study was conducted among CMC, their family caregivers, and physicians in SC. Electronic health records data from a primary care clinic within a large health system (7\/1\/2022-6\/30\/2023) was analyzed. Logistic regression examined factors associated with hospitalizations among CMC. In-depth interviews (N\u2009=\u200915) were conducted among physicians and caregivers of CMC statewide. Patient-level quantitative data is triangulated with conceptual findings from interviews.Findings may inform multi-level solutions for accessible, high-quality home nursing care among CMC and their families. Providers may learn from caregivers' insight to emphasize family-centered care practices, acknowledging time and financial constraints while optimizing the quality of medical care provided in the home.Children with medical complexity (CMC) comprise\u2009<\u20091% of the pediatric population, but account for nearly one-third of healthcare expenditures. Further, while CMC account for up to 80% of pediatric inpatient hospital costs, only 2% of Medicaid spending is attributed to home healthcare. As a result, the current health system heavily relies on family caregivers to fill existing care gaps. This study aimed to: (1) examine factors associated with hospital admissions among CMC and (2) contextualize the potential for home nursing care to improve outcomes among CMC and their families in South Carolina (SC).","1284":"In microbial communities, viruses compete with each other for host cells to infect. As a consequence of competition for hosts, viruses evolve inhibitory mechanisms to suppress their competitors. One such mechanism is superinfection exclusion, in which a preexisting viral infection prevents a secondary infection. The bacteriophage \u03a6X174 exhibits a potential superinfection inhibition mechanism (in which secondary infections are either blocked or resisted) known as the reduction effect. In this auto-inhibitory phenomenon, a plasmid containing a fragment of the \u03a6X174 genome confers resistance to infection among cells that were once permissive to \u03a6X174. Taking advantage of this plasmid system, we examine the inhibitory properties of the \u03a6X174 reduction effect on a range of wild \u03a6X174-like phages. We then assess how closely the reduction effect in the plasmid system mimics natural superinfection inhibition by carrying out phage-phage competitions in continuous culture, and we evaluate whether the overall competitive advantage can be predicted by phage fitness or by a combination of fitness and reduction effect inhibition. Our results show that viral fitness often correctly predicts the winner. However, a phage's reduction sequence also provides an advantage to the phage in some cases, modulating phage-phage competition and allowing for persistence where competitive exclusion was expected. These findings provide strong evidence for more complex dynamics than were previously thought, in which the reduction effect may inhibit fast-growing viruses, thereby helping to facilitate coexistence.","1285":"Epidemiologic screening programs often make use of tests with small, but non-zero probabilities of misdiagnosis. In this article, we assume the target population is finite with a fixed number of true cases, and that we apply an imperfect test with known sensitivity and specificity to a sample of individuals from the population. In this setting, we propose an enhanced inferential approach for use in conjunction with sampling-based bias-corrected prevalence estimation. While ignoring the finite nature of the population can yield markedly conservative estimates, direct application of a standard finite population correction (FPC) conversely leads to underestimation of variance. We uncover a way to leverage the typical FPC indirectly toward valid statistical inference. In particular, we derive a readily estimable extra variance component induced by misclassification in this specific but arguably common diagnostic testing scenario. Our approach yields a standard error estimate that properly captures the sampling variability of the usual bias-corrected maximum likelihood estimator of disease prevalence. Finally, we develop an adapted Bayesian credible interval for the true prevalence that offers improved frequentist properties (i.e., coverage and width) relative to a Wald-type confidence interval. We report the simulation results to demonstrate the enhanced performance of the proposed inferential methods.","1286":"Since its reintroduction in 2015, rabies has been established as an enzootic disease among the dog population of Arequipa, Peru. Given the unknown rate of dog bites, the risk of human rabies transmission is concerning. Our objective was to estimate the rate of dog bites in the city and to identify factors associated with seeking health care in a medical facility for wound care and rabies prevention follow-up. To this end, we conducted a door-to-door survey with 4,370 adults in 21 urban and 21 peri-urban communities. We then analyzed associations between seeking health care following dog bites and various socioeconomic factors, stratifying by urban and peri-urban localities. We found a high annual rate of dog bites in peri-urban communities (12.4%), which was 2.6 times higher than that in urban areas (4.8%). Among those who were bitten, the percentage of people who sought medical treatment was almost twice as high in urban areas (39.1%) as in peri-urban areas (21.4%).","1287":"Patients with mpox diagnosed or treated within the Johns Hopkins Health System between 1 June and 15 December 2022 were included. The primary outcome of interest was risk of hospitalization. Demographic features, comorbid conditions, treatment, and clinical outcomes were determined.A total of 353 patients were tested or treated for mpox; 100 had mpox diagnosed or treated (median age, 35.3 years; 97.0% male; 57.0% black and 10.0% Hispanic; 46.0% people with HIV [PWH]). Seventeen patients (17.0%) required hospitalization, 10 of whom were PWH. Age >40 years, race, ethnicity, HIV status, insurance status, and body mass index >30 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) were not associated with hospitalization. Eight of 9 patients (88.9%) with immunosuppression were hospitalized. Immunosuppression was associated with hospitalization in univariate (odds ratio, 69.3 [95% confidence interval, 7.8-619.7]) and adjusted analysis (adjusted odds ratio, 94.8 [8.5-1060.1]). Two patients (11.8%) who were hospitalized required intensive care unit admission and died; both had uncontrolled HIV infection and CD4 T-cell counts <50\/\u00b5L. Median cycle threshold values for the first positive mpox virus sample did not differ between those who were hospitalized and those who were not.Immunosuppression was a significant risk factor for hospitalization with mpox. PWH with CD4 T-cell counts <50\/\u00b5L are at high risk of death due to mpox infection. Patients who are immunosuppressed should be considered for early and aggressive treatment of mpox, given the increased risk of hospitalization.During the 2022 mpox outbreak most patients were managed as outpatients, but some required hospitalization. Uncontrolled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been identified as a risk factor for severe mpox.","1288":"Explanations of how organisms might adapt to urban environments have mostly focused on divergent natural selection and adaptive plasticity. However, differential habitat choice has been suggested as an alternative. Here, we test for habitat choice in enhancing crypsis in ground-perching grasshoppers colonizing an urbanized environment, composed of a mosaic of four distinctly coloured substrates (asphalt roads and adjacent pavements). Additionally, we determine its relative importance compared to present-day natural selection and phenotypic plasticity. We found that grasshoppers are very mobile, but nevertheless approximately match the colour of their local substrate. By manipulating grasshopper colour, we confirm that grasshoppers increase the usage of those urban substrates that resemble their own colours. This selective movement actively improves crypsis. Colour divergence between grasshoppers on different substrates is not or hardly owing to present-day natural selection, because observed mortality rates are too low to counteract random substrate use. Additional experiments also show negligible contributions from plasticity in colour. Our results confirm that matching habitat choice can be an important driver of adaptation to urban environments. In general, studies should more fully incorporate that individuals are not only selective targets (i.e. selected on by the environment), but also selective agents (i.e. selecting their own environments).","1289":"Borrelia turicatae is a causative agent of tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) in the subtropics and tropics of the United States and Latin America. Historically, B. turicatae was thought to be maintained in enzootic cycles in rural areas. However, there is growing evidence that suggests the pathogen has established endemic foci in densely populated regions of Texas. With the growth of homelessness in the state and human activity in city parks, it was important to implement field collection efforts to identify areas where B. turicatae and its vector circulate. Between 2017 and 2020 we collected Ornithodoros turicata ticks in suburban and urban areas including public and private parks and recreational spaces. Ticks were fed on na\u00efve mice and spirochetes were isolated from the blood. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed on eight newly obtained isolates and included previously reported sequences. The four chromosomal loci targeted for MLST were 16S ribosomal RNA (rrs), flagellin B (flaB), DNA gyrase B (gyrB), and the intergenic spacer (IGS). Given the complexity of Borrelia genomes, plasmid diversity was also evaluated. These studies indicate that the IGS locus segregates B. turicatae into four genomic types and plasmid diversity is extensive between isolates. Furthermore, B. turicatae and its vector have established endemic foci in parks and recreational areas in densely populated settings of Texas.","1290":"The laboratory study demonstrated that all organisms achieved at least 4 log10 median reductions (HP>QAC\/alcohol>QAC>QAC\/saline). Pseudomonas was highly susceptible to HP and QAC\/alcohol and \u03a66 to all disinfectants. MS2 reduction was highest using HP and lowest using QAC\/saline. Bacillus was least susceptible. The volunteer study showed a 3 to 4 log10 average reductions of bacteria and virus; Raoultella reductions were greater than MS2, with variability within and between subjects. Conclusions: HP disinfectant wipes used in laboratory and by volunteers reduce bacteria and viruses on EHMRs by 3 to 4 log10 on average.We inoculated EHMR (Honeywell model RU8500) surfaces with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus atrophaeus spores, and bacteriophages MS2 and \u03a66, and disinfected them using two wipes with hydrogen peroxide (HP), alcohols, and quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs). Then, we randomized 54 volunteer subjects into three groups (Group 1: two wipes with instructions, Group 2: five wipes with instructions, Group 3: no instructions or set number of wipes) and used 0.5% HP wipes without precleaning on EHMRs inoculated with Raoultella terrigena and MS2.Commercially available hospital disinfectant wipes reduce bacteria and viruses on EHMRs and can fill the need for between-use disinfection. HP and combination QAC\/alcohol have the greatest efficacy under our test conditions.During shortages, elastomeric half-mask respirators (EHMRs) are an alternative to reusing N95 filtering facepiece respirators but require between-use disinfection. The objectives of this study were to (a) measure microbial reductions on EHMR surfaces under laboratory conditions by a standardized procedure using wipes impregnated with health care disinfectants and to (b) measure microbial reductions on EHMRs disinfected by volunteer health care providers.","1291":" This study found that the odds of suicidal ideation were lower among YTW who had mothers who were supportive of their transgender identity. Our results suggest that parent-focused interventions to improve the relationships between YTW and their parents may lower the odds of YTW having suicidal ideation. Clinical Trial Registration Identifier: NCT01575938.","1292":"Men in sub-Saharan Africa are less likely than women to initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) and more likely to have longer cycles of disengagement from ART programmes. Treatment interventions that meet the unique needs of men are needed, but they must be scalable. We will test the impact of various interventions on 6-month retention in ART programmes among men living with HIV who are not currently engaged in care (never initiated ART and ART clients with treatment interruption).NCT05137210.5 May 2023; version 3.We will conduct a programmatic, individually randomised, non-blinded, controlled trial. 'Non-engaged' men will be randomised 1:1:1 to either a low-intensity, high-intensity or stepped arm. The low-intensity intervention includes one-time male-specific counseling+facility navigation only. The high-intensity intervention offers immediate outside-facility ART initiation+male-specific counselling+facility navigation for follow-up ART visits. In the stepped arm, intervention activities build in intensity over time for those who do not re-engage in care with the following steps: (1) one-time male-specific counselling+facility navigation\u2192(2) ongoing male mentorship+facility navigation\u2192(3) outside-facility ART initiation+male-specific counselling+facility navigation for follow-up ART visits. Our primary outcome is 6-month retention in care. Secondary outcomes include cost-effectiveness and rates of adverse events. The primary analysis will be intention to treat with all eligible men in the denominator and all men retained in care at 6 months in the numerator. The proportions achieving the primary outcome will be compared with a risk ratio, corresponding 95% CI and p value computed using binomial regression accounting for clustering at facility level.The Institutional Review Board of the University of California, Los Angeles and the National Health Sciences Research Council in Malawi have approved the trial protocol. Findings will be disseminated rapidly in national and international forums and in peer-reviewed journals and are expected to provide urgently needed information to other countries and donors.","1293":"While researchers and agencies from low- and middle-income countries often contribute significantly to public health surveillance data, which is crucial for effective pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response activities, they often do not receive adequate compensation for their contributions. Incentivizing data sharing is important for informing public health responses to pathogens with pandemic potential. However, existing data-sharing legal frameworks have limitations. In this context, we looked beyond \"business as usual\" candidates to explore the applicability of a benefit-sharing model developed and implemented by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (International Federation of Association Football; FIFA) in international association football. This model rewards grassroots contributions and redistributes benefits, promoting a fair balance of interests across diverse economic contexts. We discuss adapting FIFA's mechanisms, including training compensation and solidarity payments, to create a novel benefit-sharing framework in global health. Given the complexity of global health, we note ways in which components of the FIFA model would need to be adapted for global health. Challenges such as integrating into existing legal frameworks, ensuring broad international buy-in, and accommodating different pandemic periods are examined. While adapting the FIFA model presents challenges, it offers a promising approach to achieving more equitable data sharing and benefit distribution in global health.","1294":"The risk and severity of pathogen infections in humans, livestock, or wild organisms depend on host immune function, which can vary between closely related host populations or even among individuals. This immune variation can entail between-population differences in immune gene coding sequences, copy number, or expression. In recent years, many studies have focused on population divergence in immunity using whole-tissue transcriptomics. But, whole-tissue transcriptomics cannot distinguish between evolved differences in gene regulation within cells, versus changes in cell composition within the focal tissue. Here, we leverage single-cell transcriptomic approaches to document signatures of microevolution of immune system structure in a natural system, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We sampled nine adult fish from three populations with variability in resistance to a cestode parasite, Schistocephalus solidus, to create the first comprehensive immune cell atlas for G. aculeatus. Eight broad immune cell types, corresponding to major vertebrate immune cells, were identified. We were also able to document significant variation in both abundance and expression profiles of the individual immune cell types among the three populations of fish. Furthermore, we demonstrate that identified cell type markers can be used to reinterpret traditional transcriptomic data: we reevaluate previously published whole-tissue transcriptome data from a quantitative genetic experimental infection study to gain better resolution relating infection outcomes to inferred cell type variation. Our combined study demonstrates the power of single-cell sequencing to not only document evolutionary phenomena (i.e., microevolution of immune cells) but also increase the power of traditional transcriptomic data sets.","1295":"Phylogenetic comparative methods have become standard for investigating evolutionary hypotheses, including in studies of human evolution. While these methods account for the non-independence of trait data due to phylogeny, they often fail to consider intraspecific variation, which may lead to biased or erroneous results. We assessed the degree to which intraspecific variation impacts the results of comparative analyses by investigating the \"social brain\" hypothesis, which has provided a framework for explaining complex cognition and large brains in humans. This hypothesis suggests that group life imposes a cognitive challenge, with species living in larger social groups having comparably larger neocortex ratios than those living in smaller groups. Primates, however, vary considerably in group size within species, a fact that has been ignored in previous analyses. When within-species variation in group size is high, the common practice of using a mean value to represent the species may be inappropriate. We conducted regression and resampling analyses to ascertain whether the relationship between neocortex ratio and group size across primate species persists after controlling for within-species variation in group size. We found that in a sample of 23 primates, 70% of the variation in group size was due to between-species variation. Controlling for within-species variation in group size did not affect the results of phylogenetic analyses, which continued to show a positive relationship between neocortex ratio and group size. Analyses restricted to non-monogamous primates revealed considerable intraspecific variation in group size, but the positive association between neocortex ratio and group size remained even after controlling for within-species variation in group size. Our findings suggest that the relationship between neocortex size and group size in primates is robust. In addition, our methods and associated computer code provide a way to assess and account for intraspecific variation in other comparative analyses of primate evolution.","1296":"We developed a simulation model to illustrate and evaluate the potential effects of opioid-related policies and interventions at the local (e.g., community) level. In the United States, the opioid epidemic was declared a national public health emergency in 2017 because of extremely large numbers of opioid-related overdose deaths. Overprescription of addictive opioid-based painkillers could lead to physical dependence with subsequent dose increase. Some patients switch to heroin to support their drug habit. The use of high doses of prescription opioids, heroin especially in combination with a more powerful synthetic opioid, fentanyl, can sometimes lead to overdose, which can be lethal. A number of prevention and treatment policies have been proposed and some implemented to fight the epidemic. These policies include prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMP), reduced initial opioid dose distribution of naloxone to counter overdose, medication-assisted treatment of problem users, and tamper-proof pills to prevent noncompliant behavior. The model describes the dynamics of opioid prescription and use in an interconnected community of pain patients. The model simulates individual patients\u0092 life trajectories with respect to the use of opioids under different policies. The model includes potential policies based on the overdose and mortality rates of prescription opioid users, the overdose and mortality rates of heroin users, and the number of patients who turn to illicit means to acquire their drugs. Simulation study results show strong effects of naloxone use, very marginal short-term effects of PDMP compliance, and few to no positive effects of tamper-resistant medications on non-child opioid use trajectories.","1297":"We used survey data collected from the internet-based ARTnet study between 2017 and 2019 on STI screening among MSM across the U.S., stratified by current, prior, and never PrEP use. Poisson regression models with robust error variance were used to model factors, including residence in the Southeast, associated with consistent (\"always\" or \"sometimes\") exposure site-specific STI screening during PrEP care.Substantial gaps exist between CDC recommendations for STI screening during PrEP care and current clinical practice, particularly for rectal and pharyngeal exposure sites that can harbor asymptomatic infections and for MSM in Southeast states where the STI burden is substantial.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends comprehensive sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening every 3-6 months for men who have sex with men (MSM) using HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The gaps between these recommendations and clinical practice by region have not been quantified.Of 3259 HIV-negative MSM, 19% were currently using PrEP, 6% had used PrEP in the past, and 75% had never used PrEP. Among ever PrEP users, 87%, 78%, 57%, and 64% reported consistent screening for STIs by blood sample, urine sample or urethral swab, rectal swab, or pharyngeal swab, respectively, during PrEP care. Compared to PrEP users in all other regions, PrEP users in the Southeast were significantly less likely to be consistently screened for urogenital (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-0.98) and rectal STIs (aPR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62-0.93) during PrEP care.","1298":"Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) is a growing interdisciplinary field addressing exposures to microbial pathogens and infectious disease processes. Risk science is inherently interdisciplinary, but few of the contributing disciplinary programs offer courses and training specifically in QMRA. To develop multidisciplinary training in QMRA, an annual 10-day long intensive workshop was conducted from 2015 to 2019-the Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment Interdisciplinary Instructional Institute (QMRA III). National leaders in the fields of public health, engineering, microbiology, epidemiology, communications, public policy, and QMRA served as instructors and mentors over the course of the program. To provide cross-training, multidisciplinary teams of 5-6 trainees were created from the approximately 30 trainees each year. A formal assessment of the program was performed based on observations and surveys containing Likert-type scales and open-ended prompts. In addition, a longitudinal alumni survey was also disseminated to facilitate the future redevelopment of QMRA institutes and determine the impact of the program. Across all years, trainees experienced statistically significant increases (P < 0.05) in their perceptions of their QMRA abilities (e.g., use of specific computer programs) and knowledge of QMRA constructs (e.g., risk management). In addition, 12 publications, three conference presentations, and two research grants were derived from the QMRA III institute projects or tangential research. The success of QMRA III indicates that a short course format can effectively address many multidisciplinary training needs. Key features of QMRA III, including the inter-disciplinary training approach, hands-on exercises, real-world institute projects, and interaction through a mentoring process, were vital for training multidisciplinary teams housing multiple forms of expertise. Future QMRA institutes are being redeveloped to leverage hybrid learning formats that can further the multidisciplinary training and mentoring objectives.","1299":"Of 391 photos, one-fifth were discarded as ungradable. Compared with field grading, photo grading consistently underdiagnosed TF. Compared with field grading, DSLR photo grading resulted in a higher prevalence and sensitivity than smartphone photo grading. FGDs indicated that communities and trainers found photography acceptable and preferred smartphones to DSLR in terms of practicalities, but image quality was of paramount importance for trainers.Photography is acceptable and feasible, but further work is needed to ensure high-quality images that enable accurate and consistent grading before being routinely implemented in trachoma surveys.Photography could be used to train individuals to diagnose trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) as trachoma prevalence decreases and to ensure accurate field TF grading in trachoma prevalence surveys. We compared photograph and field TF grading and determined the acceptability and feasibility of eyelid photography to community members and trachoma survey trainers.A total of 100 children ages 1-9\u00a0y were examined for TF in two Maasai villages in Tanzania. Two images of the right everted superior tarsal conjunctiva of each child were taken with a smartphone and a digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera. Two graders independently graded all photos. Focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with community members and Tropical Data trainers.","1300":"This review summarizes the use of genetic similarity clusters to understand HIV transmission and inform prevention efforts.Recent emphases include the development of real-time cluster identification in order to interrupt transmission chains, the use of clusters to estimate rates of transmission along the HIV care cascade, and the extension of cluster analyses to understand transmission in the generalized epidemics of sub-Saharan Africa. Importantly, this recent empirical work has been accompanied by theoretical work that elucidates the processes that underlie HIV genetic similarity clusters; multiple studies suggest that clusters are not necessarily enriched with individuals with high transmission rates, but rather can reflect variation in sampling times within a population, with individuals sampled early in infection more likely to cluster. Analyses of genetic similarity clusters have great promise to inform HIV epidemiology and prevention. Future emphases should include the collection of additional sequence data from underrepresented populations, such as those in sub-Saharan Africa, and further development and evaluation of clustering methods.","1301":"The term \"pathogen emergence\" encompasses everything from previously unidentified viruses entering the human population to established pathogens invading new populations and the evolution of drug resistance. Mathematical models of emergent pathogens allow forecasts of case numbers, investigation of transmission mechanisms, and evaluation of control options. Yet, there are numerous limitations and pitfalls to their use, often driven by data scarcity. Growing availability of data on pathogen genetics and human ecology, coupled with computational and methodological innovations, is amplifying the power of models to inform the public health response to emergence events. Tighter integration of infectious disease models with public health practice and development of resources at the ready has the potential to increase the timeliness and quality of responses.","1302":"State and county policies had an impact on local pandemic trajectories. The rural-urban disparities in case burden call for evidence-based approaches in tailoring health promotion interventions and vaccination campaigns to rural residents.Stay-at-home orders, face mask mandates, and vaccinations were associated with the most significant reductions in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the three southern states. Rt across the three states decreased significantly by \u226520% following stay-at-home orders. We observed varying degrees of reductions in Rt across states following other policies. Rural Alabama counties experienced higher per capita cumulative cases relative to urban ones as of June 17 and October 17, 2020. Meanwhile, Louisiana and Mississippi saw the disproportionate impact of SARS-CoV-2 in rural counties compared to urban ones throughout the study period.To quantify and compare SARS-CoV-2 transmission potential across Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi and selected counties.To determine the time-varying reproduction number Rt of SARS-CoV-2, we applied the R package EpiEstim to the time series of daily incidence of confirmed cases (mid-March 2020 - May 17, 2021) shifted backward by 9 days. Median Rt percentage change when policies changed was determined. Linear regression was performed between log10-transformed cumulative incidence and log10-transformed population size at four time points.","1303":"The key epidemiological drivers of Clostridioides difficile transmission are not well understood. We estimated epidemiological parameters to characterize variation in C. difficile transmission, while accounting for the imperfect nature of surveillance tests.A combined 2425 patients had 5491 admissions into 1 of the 2 units. A total of 3559 surveillance tests were collected from 1394 patients, with 11% of the surveillance tests being positive for C. difficile. We estimate that the transmission rate in the BMT unit was nearly 3-fold higher at 0.29 acquisitions per percentage colonized per 1000 days, compared to our estimate in the STU (0.10). Our model suggests that 20% of individuals admitted into either the STU or BMT unit were colonized with C. difficile at the time of admission. In contrast, the percentage of surveillance tests that were positive within 1 day of admission to either unit for C. difficile was 13.4%, with 15.4% in the STU and 11.6% in the BMT unit.Although prevalence was similar between the units, there were important differences in the rates of transmission and clearance. Influential factors may include antimicrobial exposure or other patient-care factors.We conducted a retrospective analysis of C. difficile surveillance tests for patients admitted to a bone marrow transplant (BMT) unit or a solid tumor unit (STU) in a 565-bed tertiary hospital. We constructed a transmission model for estimating key parameters, including admission prevalence, transmission rate, and duration of colonization to understand the potential variation in C. difficile dynamics between these 2 units.","1304":"Given the link between vaccine hesitancy and vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks, it is critical to examine the cognitive processes that contribute to the development of vaccine hesitancy, especially among parents of adolescents. We conducted a secondary analysis of baseline data from a two-phase randomized trial on human papillomavirus to investigate how vaccine hesitancy and intent to vaccinate are associated with six decision-making factors: base rate neglect, conjunction fallacy, sunk cost bias, present bias, risk aversion, and information avoidance. We recruited 1,413 adults residing in the United States with at least one daughter aged 9-17\u00a0years old through an online survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Vaccine hesitancy, intent to vaccinate, and susceptibility to cognitive biases was measured through a series of brief questionnaires. 1,400 participants were in the final analyzed sample. Most participants were white (74.1%), female (71.6%), married (75.3%), and had a college or graduate\/professional education (88.8%). Conjunction fallacy, sunk cost bias, information avoidance, and present bias may be associated with vaccine hesitancy. Intent to vaccinate may be associated with information avoidance. These results suggest that cognitive biases play a role in developing parental vaccine hesitancy and vaccine-related behavior.","1305":"A health-facility based cross-sectional study was conducted in febrile patients seeking a malaria diagnosis in 2018. Blood samples were collected by finger-prick for microscopic examination of blood smears, malaria RDT, and molecular analysis using dried blood spots (DBS) prepared on Whatman filter paper. A total of 218 P. falciparum positive samples confirmed by quantitative PCR were included for molecular assay of pfhrp2\/3 target gene.Of 218 P. falciparum positive samples, exon 2 deletions were observed in 17.9% of pfhrp2 gene and in 9.2% of pfhrp3 gene. A high proportion of deletions in short segments of pfhrp2 exon1-2 (50%) was also detected while the deletions of the pfhrp3 exon1-2 gene were 4.1%. The deletions were extended to the downstream and upstream of the flanking regions in pfhrp2\/3 gene (above 30%). Of eighty-six PfHRP2 RDT negative samples, thirty-six lacked pfhrp2 exon 2. Five PfHRP2 RDT negative samples had double deletions in pfhrp2 exon 2 and pfhrp3 exon2. Of these double deletions, only two of the samples with a parasite density above 2000 parasite\/\u00b5l were positive by the microscopy. Three samples with intact pfhrp3 exon2 in the pfhrp2 exon2 deleted parasite isolates were found to be positive by PfHRP2 RDT and microscopy with a parasite density above 10,000\/\u00b5l.Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) targeting histidine rich protein 2(HRP2) are widely used for diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infections. Besides PfHRP2, the PfHRP3 antigen contributes to the detection of P. falciparum infections in PfHRP2 RDTs. However, the performance HRP2-based RDT is affected by pfhrp2\/3 gene deletions resulting in false-negative test results. The objective of this study was to determine the presence and prevalence of pfhrp2\/3 gene deletions including the respective flanking regions among symptomatic patients in Assosa zone, Northwest Ethiopia.This study confirms the presence of deletions of pfhrp2\/3 gene including the flanking regions. Pfhrp2\/3 gene deletions results in false-negative results undoubtedly affect the current malaria control and elimination effort in the country. However, further countrywide investigations are required to determine the magnitude of pfhrp2\/3 gene deletions and its consequences on routine malaria diagnosis.","1306":"Zinc-air batteries (ZABs) have promising prospects as next-generation electrochemical energy systems due to their high safety, high power density, environmental friendliness, and low cost. However, the air cathodes used in ZABs still face many challenges, such as the low catalytic activity and poor stability of carbon-based materials at high current density\/voltage. To achieve high activity and stability of rechargeable ZABs, chemically and electrochemically stable air cathodes with bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)\/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, fast reaction rate with low platinum group metal (PGM) loading or PGM-free materials are required, which are difficult to achieve with common electrocatalysts. Meanwhile, inorganic nanoporous metal films (INMFs) have many advantages as self-standing air cathodes, such as high activity and stability for both the ORR\/OER under highly alkaline conditions. The high surface area, three-dimensional channels, and porous structure with controllable crystal growth facet\/direction make INMFs an ideal candidate as air cathodes for ZABs. In this review, we first revisit some critical descriptors to assess the performance of ZABs, and recommend the standard test and reported manner. We then summarize the recent progress of low-Pt, low-Pd, and PGM-free-based materials as air cathodes with low\/non-PGM loading for rechargeable ZABs. The structure-composition-performance relationship between INMFs and ZABs is discussed in-depth. Finally, we provide our perspectives on the further development of INMFs towards rechargeable ZABs, as well as current issues that need to be addressed. This work will not only attract researchers' attention and guide them to assess and report the performance of ZABs more accurately, but also stimulate more innovative strategies to drive the practical application of INMFS for ZABs and other energy-related technologies.","1307":"By April 2, 2020, >1 million persons worldwide were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. We used a mathematical model to investigate the effectiveness of social distancing interventions in a mid-sized city. Interventions reduced contacts of adults >60 years of age, adults 20-59 years of age, and children <19 years of age for 6 weeks. Our results suggest interventions started earlier in the epidemic delay the epidemic curve and interventions started later flatten the epidemic curve. We noted that, while social distancing interventions were in place, 20% of new cases and most hospitalizations and deaths were averted, even with modest reductions in contact among adults. However, when interventions ended, the epidemic rebounded. Our models suggest that social distancing can provide crucial time to increase healthcare capacity but must occur in conjunction with testing and contact tracing of all suspected cases to mitigate virus transmission.","1308":"HIV incidence has been declining in Africa with scale-up of HIV interventions. However, there is limited data on HIV evolutionary trends in African populations with waning epidemics. We evaluated changes in HIV viral diversity and genetic divergence in southern Uganda over a twenty-five-year period spanning the introduction and scale-up of HIV prevention and treatment programs using HIV sequence and survey data from the Rakai Community Cohort Study, an open longitudinal population-based HIV surveillance cohort. Gag (p24) and env (gp41) HIV data were generated from persons living with HIV (PLHIV) in 31 inland semi-urban trading and agrarian communities (1994 to 2018) and four hyperendemic Lake Victoria fishing communities (2011 to 2018) under continuous surveillance. HIV subtype was assigned using the Recombination Identification Program with phylogenetic confirmation. Inter-subtype diversity was estimated using the Shannon diversity index and intra-subtype diversity with the nucleotide diversity and pairwise TN93 genetic distance. Genetic divergence was measured using root-to-tip distance and pairwise TN93 genetic distance analyses. Evolutionary dynamics were assessed among demographic and behavioral sub-groups, including by migration status. 9,931 HIV sequences were available from 4,999 PLHIV, including 3,060 and 1,939 persons residing in inland and fishing communities, respectively. In inland communities, subtype A1 viruses proportionately increased from 14.3% in 1995 to 25.9% in 2017 (p<0.001), while those of subtype D declined from 73.2% in 1995 to 28.2% in 2017 (p<0.001). The proportion of viruses classified as recombinants significantly increased by more than four-fold. Inter-subtype HIV diversity has generally increased. While p24 intra-subtype genetic diversity and divergence leveled off after 2014, diversity and divergence of gp41 increased through 2017. Inter- and intra-subtype viral diversity increased across all population sub-groups, including among individuals with no recent migration history or extra-community sexual partners. This study provides insights into population-level HIV evolutionary dynamics in declining African HIV epidemics following the scale-up of HIV prevention and treatment programs. Continued molecular surveillance may provide a better understanding of the dynamics driving population HIV evolution and yield important insights for epidemic control and vaccine development.","1309":"In this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we tested for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a non-random cohort of residents living in Centre County prior to the Fall 2020 term at the Pennsylvania State University and following the conclusion of the Fall 2020 term. We also report the seroprevalence in a non-random cohort of students collected at the end of the Fall 2020 term.Of 345 community participants, 19 (5\u00b75%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies at their first visit between 7 August and 2 October. Of 625 student participants who returned to campus for fall instruction, 195 (31\u00b72%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies between 26 October and 23 November. Twenty-eight (8\u00b71%) community participants returned a positive IgG antibody result by 9 December. Only contact with known SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals and attendance at small gatherings (20-50 individuals) were significant predictors of detecting IgG antibodies among returning students (aOR, 95% CI: 3\u00b724, 2\u00b714-4\u00b791; 1\u00b762, 1\u00b708-2\u00b744; respectively).The Pennsylvania State University Office of the Provost, Social Science Research Institute, Huck Institute for the Life Sciences, and Clinical and Translational Science Institute; National Institutes of Health. The influx of students into college and university towns reflects a significant increase in population size and density that could result in increases in COVID-19 risk in surrounding communities. Despite the potential risk, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 transmission may lag behind in surrounding communities This implies the potential to minimize the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from high prevalence sub-populations with targeted interventions. Future work should investigate the relative efficacy of specific measures to reduce risk of transmission between subpopulations and guide communities with high levels of episodic migration and similar high-density subpopulations.Returning university students represent large-scale, transient demographic shifts and a potential source of transmission to adjacent communities during the COVID-19 pandemic.Despite high seroprevalence observed within the student population, seroprevalence in a longitudinal cohort of community residents was low and stable from before student arrival for the Fall 2020 term to after student departure. The study implies that heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 transmission can occur in geographically coincident populations.","1310":" Associations between \u03b2-lactams and other antimicrobial classes (macrolides, lincosamides, and fluoroquinolones) were common, although the strength of the association among these antimicrobial classes varied by infection site and by methicillin susceptibility. Association mining identified associations between clinically important AMR traits, which could be further investigated for evidence of resistance co-selection. For example, in skin and skin structure infections, clindamycin and tetracycline resistance occurred together 1.5 times more often than expected if they were independent from one another. Association mining efficiently discovered and quantified associations among resistance traits; allowing these associations to be compared between relevant subsets of isolates to identify and track clinically relevant MDR.","1311":"The diagnosis and management of dry eye disease (DED) could be complicated by the discordance between DED-related symptoms and signs. We performed a cross-sectional study to investigate the factors of and develop predictive models for the discrepancy in DED symptomatology.Ten predictors, such as \"vitality,\" \"immunomodulating drugs,\" sensory symptoms,\" and \"ethnicity,\" remained in the final models, achieving an adjusted R2 (aR2) of 0.35 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32-0.39). Specifically, medication use explained 19% (95% CI, 0.17-0.22) of the variance in the outcome, followed by medical history (aR2 = 0.18; 95% CI, 0.15-0.21). Health-related quality of life contributed 16% to the variance in the outcome (95% CI, 0.13-0.19), and, last, demographics contributed 11% (95% CI, 0.09-0.13).We used data from 3455 participants, 21 to 89 years old, from the Sj\u00f6gren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance study. We performed a multivariable stepwise linear regression model with backward elimination and Bayesian information criteria to select predictors for the discordance in DES symptomatology, which was defined as the difference between the rank score of Ocular Surface Disease Index 6 (OSDI-6) and the rank score of ocular staining score (OSS).Our results suggest that individuals of Asian descent and those using immunomodulating medications often present with severe ocular signs that necessitate regular ophthalmological evaluations, even in the absence of proportionate ocular symptoms. Additionally, ocular symptoms, when accompanied by abnormal sensations in other parts of the body, could indicate systemic conditions that require further investigation and medical care.","1312":"Cigarette smoking confers additional risk from influenza. This study assessed the effect of smoking on humoral immune response to influenza vaccine. Adults \u226550\u2009y of age were enrolled during the 2011-2016 influenza vaccination seasons in an observational prospective study. Non-fasting whole blood samples for hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays were obtained from participants at pre- and 28\u2009d post-clinically administered, trivalent influenza vaccination. Among 273 participants, 133 subjects self-reported as never smokers, 87 as ex-smokers, and 53 as current smokers. Postvaccination geometric mean HAI titers were significantly higher among smokers for A\/H1N1 (p\u2009=\u2009.031) and A\/H3N2 (p\u2009=\u2009.001). Relative to never smokers, smoking was independently related to seroconversion to A\/H1N1, A\/H3N2 and B. The adjusted odd ratios (ORs) were 5.2 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.3, 11.5] for seroconversion to A\/H1N1, 5.4 (95% CI, 2.4, 12.1) for A\/H3N2, and 2.7 (95% CI, 1.3, 5.7) for B. Smoking was also independently related to seroprotection to A\/H1N1, A\/H3N2 and B. The ORs were 3.6 (95% CI, 1.6, 8.08) for seroprotection to A\/H1N1 in smokers, 2.7 (95% CI, 1.14, 6.5) for A\/H3N2, and 2.5 (95% CI, 1.1, 5.7) for B. Although the mechanism is unclear, smokers showed a better immune response to influenza vaccination than never smokers and ex-smokers. The results can be used to emphasize the value of influenza vaccination for smokers.","1313":"Isolation of symptomatic infectious persons can reduce influenza transmission. However, virus shedding that occurs without symptoms will be unaffected by such measures. Identifying effective isolation strategies for influenza requires understanding the interplay between individual virus shedding and symptom presentation. From 2017 to 2020, we conducted a case-ascertained household transmission study using influenza real-time RT-qPCR testing of nasal swabs and daily symptom diary reporting for up to 7 days after enrolment (\u226414 days after index onset). We assumed real-time RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were indicators of quantitative virus shedding and used symptom diaries to create a score that tracked influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms (fever, cough, or sore throat). We fit phenomenological nonlinear mixed-effects models stratified by age and vaccination status and estimated two quantities influencing isolation effectiveness: shedding before symptom onset and shedding that might occur once isolation ends. We considered different isolation end points (including 24\u2005h after fever resolution or 5 days after symptom onset) and assumptions about the infectiousness of Ct shedding trajectories. Of the 116 household contacts with \u22652 positive tests for longitudinal analyses, 105 (91%) experienced \u22651 ILI symptom. On average, children <5 years experienced greater peak shedding, longer durations of shedding, and elevated ILI symptom scores compared with other age groups. Most individuals (63\/105) shed <10% of their total shed virus before symptom onset, and shedding after isolation varied substantially across individuals, isolation end points, and infectiousness assumptions. Our results can inform strategies to reduce transmission from symptomatic individuals infected with influenza.","1314":"In malaria endemic areas such as sub-Saharan Africa, repeated exposure to malaria results in acquired immunity to clinical disease but not infection. In prospective studies, time-to-clinical malaria and longitudinal parasite count trajectory are often analysed separately which may result in inefficient estimates since these two processes can be associated. Including parasite count as a time-dependent covariate in a model of time-to-clinical malaria episode may also be inaccurate because while clinical malaria disease frequently leads to treatment which may instantly affect the level of parasite count, standard time-to-event models require that time-dependent covariates be external to the event process. We investigated whether jointly modelling time-to-clinical malaria disease and longitudinal parasite count improves precision in risk factor estimates and assessed the strength of association between the hazard of clinical malaria and parasite count.Using a cohort data of participants enrolled with uncomplicated malaria in Malawi, a conventional Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) model of time-to-first clinical malaria episode with time-dependent parasite count was compared with three competing joint models. The joint models had different association structures linking a quasi-Poisson mixed-effects of parasite count and event-time Cox PH sub-models.Jointly modelling longitudinal parasite count and time-to-clinical malaria disease improves precision in log hazard ratio estimates compared to conventional time-dependent Cox PH model. The improved precision of joint modelling may improve study efficiency and allow for design of clinical trials with relatively lower sample sizes with increased power.There were 120 participants of whom 115 (95.8%) had >1 follow-up visit and 100 (87.5%) experienced the episode. Adults >15 years being reference, log hazard ratio for children <5 years was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.17, 1.26) in the joint model with best fit vs. 0.62 (95% CI: 0.04, 1.18) from the conventional Cox PH model. The log hazard ratio for the 5-15 years was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.22, 1.22) in the joint model vs.0.63 (95% CI: 0.11, 1.17) in the Cox PH model. The area under parasite count trajectory was strongly associated with the risk of clinical malaria, with a unit increase corresponding to-0.0012 (95% CI: -0.0021, -0.0004) decrease in log hazard ratio.","1315":"Community testing for covid-19 in S\u00e3o Paulo state, Brazil.43\u2009774 adults aged \u226570 years who were residents of S\u00e3o Paulo state and underwent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 from 17 January to 29 April 2021. 26\u2009433 cases with symptomatic covid-19 and 17\u2009622 test negative controls with covid-19 symptoms were formed into 13\u2009283 matched sets, one case with to up to five controls, according to age, sex, self-reported race, municipality of residence, previous covid-19 status, and date of RT-PCR test (\u00b13 days).RT-PCR confirmed symptomatic covid-19 and associated hospital admissions and deaths.Vaccination with a two dose regimen of CoronaVac.Adjusted vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic covid-19 was 24.7% (95% confidence interval 14.7% to 33.4%) at 0-13 days and 46.8% (38.7% to 53.8%) at \u226514 days after the second dose. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness against hospital admissions was 55.5% (46.5% to 62.9%) and against deaths was 61.2% (48.9% to 70.5%) at \u226514 days after the second dose. Vaccine effectiveness \u226514 days after the second dose was highest for the youngest age group (70-74 years)-59.0% (43.7% to 70.2%) against symptomatic disease, 77.6% (62.5% to 86.7%) against hospital admissions, and 83.9% (59.2% to 93.7%) against deaths-and declined with increasing age.To estimate the effectiveness of the inactivated whole virus vaccine, CoronaVac (Sinovac Biotech), against symptomatic covid-19 in the elderly population of S\u00e3o Paulo state, Brazil during widespread circulation of the gamma variant.Test negative case-control study.Vaccination with CoronaVac was associated with a reduction in symptomatic covid-19, hospital admissions, and deaths in adults aged \u226570 years in a setting with extensive transmission of the gamma variant. Vaccine protection was, however, low until completion of the two dose regimen, and vaccine effectiveness was observe to decline with increasing age among this elderly population.","1316":"We propose a mathematical and computational model that captures the stimulus-generated Ca2+ transients in the C. elegans ASH sensory neuron. The rationale is to develop a tool that will enable a cross-talk between modeling and experiments, using modeling results to guide targeted experimental efforts. The model is built based on biophysical events and molecular cascades known to unfold as part of neurons' Ca2+ homeostasis mechanism, as well as on Ca2+ signaling events. The state of ion channels is described by their probability of being activated or inactivated, and the remaining molecular states are based on biochemically defined kinetic equations or known biochemical motifs. We estimate the parameters of the model using experimental data of hyperosmotic stimulus-evoked Ca2+ transients detected with a FRET sensor in young and aged worms, unstressed and exposed to oxidative stress. We use a hybrid optimization method composed of a multi-objective genetic algorithm and nonlinear least-squares to estimate the model parameters. We first obtain the model parameters for young unstressed worms. Next, we use these values of the parameters as a starting point to identify the model parameters for stressed and aged worms. We show that the model, in combination with experimental data, corroborates literature results. In addition, we demonstrate that our model can be used to predict ASH response to complex combinations of stimulation pulses. The proposed model includes for the first time the ASH Ca2+ dynamics observed during both \"on\" and \"off\" responses. This mathematical and computational effort is the first to propose a dynamic model of the Ca2+ transients' mechanism in C. elegans neurons, based on biochemical pathways of the cell's Ca2+ homeostasis machinery. We believe that the proposed model can be used to further elucidate the Ca2+ dynamics of a key C. elegans neuron, to guide future experiments on C. elegans neurobiology, and to pave the way for the development of more mathematical models for neuronal Ca2+ dynamics.","1317":". We suggest that empirical studies prioritize these species to confirm predictions of vector competence, enabling the correct identification of populations at risk for transmission within the United States.","1318":"In the United States, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths are captured through the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System and death certificates reported to the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). However, not all COVID-19 deaths are recognized and reported because of limitations in testing, exacerbation of chronic health conditions that are listed as the cause of death, or delays in reporting. Estimating deaths may provide a more comprehensive understanding of total COVID-19-attributable deaths.Estimating COVID-19-attributable unrecognized deaths provides a better understanding of the COVID-19 mortality burden and may better quantify the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic.We estimated COVID-19 unrecognized attributable deaths, from March 2020-April 2021, using all-cause deaths reported to NVSS by week and six age groups (0-17, 18-49, 50-64, 65-74, 75-84, and \u226585 years) for 50 states, New York City, and the District of Columbia using a linear time series regression model. Reported COVID-19 deaths were subtracted from all-cause deaths before applying the model. Weekly expected deaths, assuming no SARS-CoV-2 circulation and predicted all-cause deaths using SARS-CoV-2 weekly percent positive as a covariate were modelled by age group and including state as a random intercept. COVID-19-attributable unrecognized deaths were calculated for each state and age group by subtracting the expected all-cause deaths from the predicted deaths.We estimated that 766,611 deaths attributable to COVID-19 occurred in the United States from March 8, 2020-May 29, 2021. Of these, 184,477 (24%) deaths were not documented on death certificates. Eighty-two percent of unrecognized deaths were among persons aged \u226565 years; the proportion of unrecognized deaths were 0\u202224-0\u202231 times lower among those 0-17 years relative to all other age groups. More COVID-19-attributable deaths were not captured during the early months of the pandemic (March-May 2020) and during increases in SARS-CoV-2 activity (July 2020, November 2020-February 2021).None.","1319":"It is well known in the literature that human behavior can change as a reaction to disease observed in others, and that such behavioral changes can be an important factor in the spread of an epidemic. It has been noted that human behavioral traits in disease avoidance are under selection in the presence of infectious diseases. Here, we explore a complementary trend: the pathogen itself might experience a force of selection to become less \"visible,\" or less \"symptomatic,\" in the presence of such human behavioral trends. Using a stochastic SIR agent-based model, we investigated the co-evolution of two viral strains with cross-immunity, where the resident strain is symptomatic while the mutant strain is asymptomatic. We assumed that individuals exercised self-regulated social distancing (SD) behavior if one of their neighbors was infected with a symptomatic strain. We observed that the proportion of asymptomatic carriers increased over time with a stronger effect corresponding to higher levels of self-regulated SD. Adding mandated SD made the effect more significant, while the existence of a time-delay between the onset of infection and the change of behavior reduced the advantage of the asymptomatic strain. These results were consistent under random geometric networks, scale-free networks, and a synthetic network that represented the social behavior of the residents of New Orleans.","1320":"Many children who develop tuberculosis are thought to be missed by diagnostic and reporting systems. We aimed to estimate paediatric tuberculosis incidence and underreporting between 2013 and 2019 in countries representing more than 99% of the global tuberculosis burden.We developed a mathematical model of paediatric tuberculosis natural history, accounting for key mechanisms and risk factors for infectious exposure (HIV, malnutrition, and BCG non-vaccination), the probability of infection given exposure, and progression to disease among infected individuals. We extracted paediatric population estimates from UN Population Division data, and we used WHO estimates for adult tuberculosis incidence rates. We parameterised this model for 185 countries and calibrated it using data from countries with stronger case detection and reporting systems. Using this model, we estimated trends in paediatric incidence, and the proportion of these cases that are diagnosed and reported (case detection ratio [CDR]) for each country, age group, and year.For 2019, we estimated 997\u2009500 (95% credible interval [CrI] 868\u2009700-1\u2009163\u2009100) incident tuberculosis cases among children, with 481\u2009000 cases (398\u2009400-587\u2009400) among those aged 0-4 years and 516\u2009500 cases (442\u2009900-608\u2009000) among those aged 5-14 years. The paediatric CDR was estimated to be lower in children aged 0-4 years (41%, 95% CrI 34-50) than in those aged 5-14 years (63%, 53-75) and varied widely between countries. Estimated CDRs increased substantially over the study period, from 18% (15-20) in 2013 to 53% (45-60) in 2019, with improvements concentrated in the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia, and Western Pacific regions. Over the study period, global incidence was estimated to have declined slowly at an average annual rate of 1\u00b752% (1\u00b742-1\u00b766).National Institutes of Health.Paediatric tuberculosis causes substantial morbidity and mortality, and these data indicate that cases (and, thus, probably associated mortality) are currently substantially underreported. These findings reinforce the need to ensure prompt diagnosis and care for children developing tuberculosis, strengthen reporting systems, and invest in research to develop more accurate and easy-to-use diagnostics for paediatric tuberculosis in high-burden settings.","1321":"The standard neutral model of molecular evolution has traditionally been used as the null model for population genomics. We gathered a collection of 45 genome-wide site frequency spectra from a diverse set of species, most of which display an excess of low and high frequency variants compared to the expectation of the standard neutral model, resulting in U-shaped spectra. We show that multiple merger coalescent models often provide a better fit to these observations than the standard Kingman coalescent. Hence, in many circumstances these under-utilized models may serve as the more appropriate reference for genomic analyses. We further discuss the underlying evolutionary processes that may result in the widespread U-shape of frequency spectra.","1322":"Objectives: With the application of a systems thinking lens, we aimed to assess the national COVID-19 response across health systems components in Switzerland, Spain, Iran, and Pakistan. Methods: We conducted four case studies on the policy response of national health systems to the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Selected countries include different health system typologies. We collected data prospectively for the period of January-July 2020 on 17 measures of the COVID-19 response recommended by the WHO that encompassed all health systems domains (governance, financing, health workforce, information, medicine and technology and service delivery). We further monitored contextual factors influencing their adoption or deployment. Results: The policies enacted coincided with a decrease in the COVID-19 transmission. However, there was inadequate communication and a perception that the measures were adverse to the economy, weakening political support for their continuation and leading to a rapid resurgence in transmission. Conclusion: Social pressure, religious beliefs, governance structure and level of administrative decentralization or global economic sanctions played a major role in how countries' health systems could respond to the pandemic.","1323":" is detectable from the stools of children using molecular methods, but processing stool specimens is resource intensive. We evaluated a novel, simple, centrifugation-free processing method for stool specimens for use on the Xpert MTB\/RIF assay (Xpert), using two different stool masses: 0.6 g and a swab sample. Two hundred eighty children (median age, 15.5 months; 35 [12.5%] HIV infected) with suspected intrathoracic TB were enrolled from two sites in South Africa. Compared to a single Xpert test on respiratory specimens, the sensitivity of Xpert on stools using the 0.6-g and swab samples was 44.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.7 to 78.8%) for both methods, with a specificity of >99%. The combined sensitivities of two stool tests versus the first respiratory Xpert were 70.0% (95% CI, 34.8 to 93.3) and 50.0% (95% CI, 18.7 to 81.3) for the 0.6-g and swab sample, respectively. Retesting stool specimens with nondeterminate Xpert results improved nondeterminate rates from 9.3% to 3.9% and from 8.6% to 4.3% for 0.6-g and swab samples, respectively. Overall, stool Xpert detected 14\/94 (14.9%) children who initiated antituberculosis treatment, while respiratory specimens detected 23\/94 (24.5%). This stool processing method is well suited for settings with low capacity for respiratory specimen collection. However, the overall sensitivity to detect confirmed and clinical TB was lower than that of respiratory specimens. More sensitive rapid molecular assays are needed to improve the utility of stools for the diagnosis of intrathoracic TB in children from resource-limited settings.","1324":"Many interdependent, real-world infrastructures involve interconnections between different communities or cities. Here we show how the effects of such interconnections can be described as an external field for interdependent networks experiencing a first-order percolation transition. We find that the critical exponents \u03b3 and \u03b4, related to the external field, can also be defined for first-order transitions but that they have different values than those found for second-order transitions. Surprisingly, we find that both sets of different exponents (for first and second order) can even be found within a single model of interdependent networks, depending on the dependency coupling strength. Nevertheless, in both cases both sets satisfy Widom's identity, \u03b4-1=\u03b3\/\u03b2, which further supports the validity of their definitions. Furthermore, we find that both Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi and scale-free networks have the same values of the exponents in the first-order regime, implying that these models are in the same universality class. In addition, we find that in k-core percolation the values of the critical exponents related to the field are the same as for interdependent networks, suggesting that these systems also belong to the same universality class.","1325":", which has led to the threat of a global resurgence of malaria and makes the generation of effective tools for controlling this disease an urgent public health priority. Here we show that the development of P.\u00a0falciparum can be rapidly and completely blocked when female Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes take up low concentrations of specific antimalarials from treated surfaces-conditions that simulate contact with a bed net. Mosquito exposure to atovaquone before, or shortly after, P. falciparum infection causes full parasite arrest in the midgut, and prevents transmission of infection. Similar transmission-blocking effects are achieved using other cytochrome b inhibitors, which demonstrates that parasite mitochondrial function is a suitable target for killing parasites. Incorporating these effects into a model of malaria transmission dynamics predicts that impregnating mosquito nets with Plasmodium inhibitors would substantially mitigate the global health effects of insecticide resistance. This study identifies a powerful strategy for blocking Plasmodium transmission by female Anopheles mosquitoes, which has promising implications for efforts to eradicate malaria.","1326":"In bipartite networks, community structures are restricted to being disassortative, in that nodes of one type are grouped according to common patterns of connection with nodes of the other type. This makes the stochastic block model (SBM), a highly flexible generative model for networks with block structure, an intuitive choice for bipartite community detection. However, typical formulations of the SBM do not make use of the special structure of bipartite networks. In this work, we introduce a Bayesian nonparametric formulation of the SBM and a corresponding algorithm to efficiently find communities in bipartite networks without overfitting. The biSBM improves community detection results over general SBMs when data are noisy, improves the model resolution limit by a factor of 2\u0096\u221a, and expands our understanding of the complicated optimization landscape associated with community detection tasks. A direct comparison of certain terms of the prior distributions in the biSBM and a related high-resolution hierarchical SBM also reveals a counterintuitive regime of community detection problems, populated by smaller and sparser networks, where non-hierarchical models outperform their more flexible counterpart.","1327":" group 2. This result was confirmed by whole genome sequencing of colonies isolated from one of the samples. Although in our case metagenome-based pathogen identification at the strain level was achieved, caution still must be exercised in interpreting strain-level results because of the challenges inherent to assigning reads to specific strains and the error rate of nanopore sequencing.","1328":"We included individuals with type 2 diabetes from 38 townships in Jiangsu Province. Screening comprised of physical examinations, symptom screening, and chest X-rays; smear and culture testing were performed through clinical triage. We assessed the yield and number needed to screen (NNS) to detect 1 tuberculosis case among all PWD, those with symptoms, and with suggestive chest X-rays. Unit costing was collected to estimate screening costs and to calculate cost per case detected. We performed a systematic review of other mass tuberculosis screening programs concentrated on PWD.The evidence-base for mass tuberculosis screening among persons with diabetes (PWD) is poor. We evaluated the yield and costs of mass screening among PWD in eastern China.A mass tuberculosis screening program focused on PWD was feasible however, the overall yield was low and not cost-efficient. Risk-stratified approaches may be practical among PWD in low- and medium tuberculosis burden settings.Of 89 549 screened PWD, 160 were diagnosed with tuberculosis (179 cases per 100 000 persons; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 153-205). The NNS was 560 (95% CI: 513-606), 248 (95% CI: 217-279), and 36 (95% CI: 24-48) among all participants, with abnormal chest X-rays, and symptoms. The cost per case was high overall (US$13 930) but lower with symptoms (US$1037) and high fasting blood glucose levels (US$6807). From systematic review, the pooled NNS to detect one case among all PWD (regardless of symptoms or chest X-ray results) in high- versus low-burden settings was 93 (95% CI: 70-141) versus 395 (95% CI: 283-649).","1329":"Airborne infectious diseases such as influenza are primarily transmitted from human to human by means of social contacts, and thus easily spread within households. Epidemic models, used to gain insight into infectious disease spread and control, typically rely on the assumption of random mixing within households. Until now, there has been no direct empirical evidence to support this assumption. Here, we present the first social contact survey specifically designed to study contact networks within households. The survey was conducted in Belgium (Flanders and Brussels) from 2010 to 2011. We analysed data from 318 households totalling 1266 individuals with household sizes ranging from two to seven members. Exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs) were fitted to the within-household contact networks to reveal the processes driving contact between household members, both on weekdays and weekends. The ERGMs showed a high degree of clustering and, specifically on weekdays, decreasing connectedness with increasing household size. Furthermore, we found that the odds of a contact between older siblings and between father and child are smaller than for any other pair. The epidemic simulation results suggest that within-household contact density is the main driver of differences in epidemic spread between complete and empirical-based household contact networks. The homogeneous mixing assumption may therefore be an adequate characterization of the within-household contact structure for the purpose of epidemic simulations. However, ignoring the contact density when inferring based on an epidemic model will result in biased estimates of within-household transmission rates. Further research regarding the implementation of within-household contact networks in epidemic models is necessary.","1330":"Background\r\nIntravascular hemolysis is an intrinsic feature of severe malaria pathophysiology but the pathogenic role of cell-free hemoglobin-mediated oxidative stress in severe malaria associated acute kidney injury (AKI) is unknown.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nAs part of a prospective observational study, enrolment plasma cell-free hemoglobin (CFH), lipid peroxidation markers (F2-isoprostanes (F2-IsoPs) and isofurans (IsoFs)), red cell deformability, and serum creatinine were quantified in Bangladeshi patients with severe falciparum malaria (n = 107), uncomplicated malaria (n = 80) and sepsis (n = 28). The relationships between these indices and kidney function and clinical outcomes were examined.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nAKI was diagnosed at enrolment in 58% (62\/107) of consecutive patients with severe malaria, defined by an increase in creatinine \u22651.5 times expected baseline. Severe malaria patients with AKI had significantly higher plasma cell-free hemoglobin (geometric mean CFH: 8.8 \u03bcM; 95% CI, 6.2\u009612.3 \u03bcM), F2-isoprostane (56.7 pg\/ml; 95% CI, 45.3\u009671.0 pg\/ml) and isofuran (109.2 pg\/ml; 95% CI, 85.1\u0096140.1 pg\/ml) concentrations on enrolment compared to those without AKI (CFH: 5.1 \u03bcM; 95% CI, 4.0\u00966.6 \u03bcM; P = 0.018; F2-IsoPs: 27.8 pg\/ml; 95% CI, 23.7\u009632.7 pg\/ml; P < 0.001; IsoFs: 41.7 pg\/ml; 95% CI, 30.2\u009657.6 pg\/ml; P < 0.001). Cell-free hemoglobin correlated with markers of hemolysis, parasite burden (P. falciparum histidine rich protein 2 (PfHRP2)), and F2-IsoPs. Plasma F2-IsoPs and IsoFs inversely correlated with pH, positively correlated with creatinine, PfHRP2 and fractional excretion of sodium, and were higher in patients later requiring hemodialysis. Plasma F2-IsoP concentrations also inversely correlated with red cell deformability and were higher in fatal cases. Mixed effects modeling including an interaction term for CFH and time showed that F2-IsoPs, IsoFs, PfHRP2, CFH, and red cell rigidity were independently associated with increasing creatinine over 72 h. Multivariable logistic regression showed that admission F2-IsoPs, IsoFs and red cell deformability were associated with the need for subsequent hemodialysis.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nCell-free hemoglobin and lipid peroxidation are associated with acute kidney injury and disease severity in falciparum malaria, suggesting a pathophysiological role in renal tubular injury. Evaluation of adjunctive therapies targeting cell-free hemoglobin-mediated oxidative stress is warranted.","1331":"A variety of complex systems exhibits different types of relationships simultaneously that can be modeled by multiplex networks. A typical problem is to determine the community structure of such systems that, in general, depend on one or more parameters to be tuned. In this study we propose one measure, grounded on information theory, to find the optimal value of the relax rate characterizing Multiplex Infomap, the generalization of the Infomap algorithm to the realm of multilayer networks. We evaluate our methodology on synthetic networks, to show that the most representative community structure can be reliably identified when the most appropriate relax rate is used. Capitalizing on these results, we use this measure to identify the most reliable meso-scale functional organization in the human protein-protein interaction multiplex network and compare the observed clusters against a collection of independently annotated gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). Our analysis reveals that modules obtained with the optimal value of the relax rate are biologically significant and, remarkably, with higher functional content than the ones obtained from the aggregate representation of the human proteome. Our framework allows us to characterize the meso-scale structure of those multilayer systems whose layers are not explicitly interconnected each other-as in the case of edge-colored models-the ones describing most biological networks, from proteomes to connectomes.","1332":"Now-outdated estimates proposed that climate change should have increased the number of people at risk of malaria, yet malaria and several other infectious diseases have declined. Although some diseases have increased as the climate has warmed, evidence for widespread climate-driven disease expansion has not materialized, despite increased research attention. Biological responses to warming depend on the non-linear relationships between physiological performance and temperature, called the thermal response curve. This leads performance to rise and fall with temperature. Under climate change, host species and their associated parasites face extinction if they cannot either thermoregulate or adapt by shifting phenology or geographic range. Climate change might also affect disease transmission through increases or decreases in host susceptibility and infective stage (and vector) production, longevity, and pathology. Many other factors drive disease transmission, especially economics, and some change in time along with temperature, making it hard to distinguish whether temperature drives disease or just correlates with disease drivers. Although it is difficult to predict how climate change will affect infectious disease, an ecological approach can help meet the challenge. ","1333":"Network models are designed to capture properties of empirical networks and thereby provide insight into the processes that underlie the formation of complex systems. As new information concerning network structure becomes available, it becomes possible to design models that more fully capture the properties of empirical networks. A recent advance in our understanding of network structure is the control profile, which summarizes the structural controllability of a network in terms of source nodes, external dilations, and internal dilations. Here, we consider the topological properties-and their formation mechanisms-that constrain the control profile. We consider five representative empirical categories of internal-dilation dominated networks, and show that the number of source and sink nodes, the form of the in- and out-degree distributions, and local complexity (e.g., cycles) shape the control profile. We evaluate network models that are sufficient to produce realistic control profiles, and conclude that holistic network models should similarly consider these properties. ","1334":"Cryptococcosis causes approximately 180\u2009000 deaths each year in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Patients with other forms of immunosuppression are also at risk, and disease is increasingly recognized in apparently immunocompetent individuals. Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii, responsible for the majority of cases, is distributed globally. We used the consensus ISHAM Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme to define the population structure of clinical C. neoformans var. grubii isolates from Laos (n = 81), which we placed into the global context using published MLST data from other countries (total N = 1047), including a reanalysis of 136 Vietnamese isolates previously reported. We observed a phylogeographical relationship in which the Laotian population was similar to its neighbor Thailand, being dominated (83%) by Sequence Types (ST) 4 and 6. This phylogeographical structure changed moving eastwards, with Vietnam's population consisting of an admixture of isolates dominated by the ST4\/ST6 (35%) and ST5 (48%) lineages. The ST5 lineage is the predominant ST reported from China and East Asia, where it accounts for >90% of isolates. Analysis of genetic distance (Fst) between different populations of C. neoformans var. grubii supports this intermediate structure of the Vietnamese population. The pathogen and host diversity reported from Vietnam provide the strongest epidemiological evidence of the association between ST5 and HIV-uninfected patients. Regional anthropological genetic distances suggest diversity in the C. neoformans var. grubii population across Southeast Asia is driven by ecological rather than human host factors. Where the ST5 lineage is present, disease in HIV-uninfected patients is to be expected.","1335":"We developed a suite of mathematical models to explore the impact of different dry-season mosquito survival strategies on the dynamics of vector populations. We fitted these models to an Anopheles population data set from Mali to estimate the model parameters and evaluate whether incorporating aestivation improved the fit of the model to the observed seasonal dynamics. We used the fitted models to explore the impact of intervention strategies that target aestivating mosquitoes in addition to targeting active mosquitoes and larvae.Plasmodium falciparum malaria remains a leading cause of death in tropical regions of the world. Despite efforts to reduce transmission, rebounds associated with the persistence of malaria vectors have remained a major impediment to local elimination. One area that remains poorly understood is how Anopheles populations survive long dry seasons to re-emerge following the onset of the rains.Dry season survival attributes appear to drive vector population persistence and therefore have implications for vector control. Further research is therefore needed to better understand these mechanisms and to evaluate the additional benefit of vector control strategies that specifically target dormant mosquitoes.Including aestivation in the model significantly improved our ability to reproduce the observed seasonal dynamics of vector populations as judged by the deviance information criterion (DIC). Furthermore, such a model resulted in more biologically plausible active mosquito survival times (for A. coluzzii median wet season survival time of 10.9 days, 95% credible interval (CrI): 10.0-14.5 days in a model with aestivation versus 38.1 days, 95% CrI: 35.8-42.5 days in a model without aestivation; similar patterns were observed for A. arabiensis). Aestivation also generated enhanced persistence of the vector population over a wider range of both survival times and fecundity levels. Adding vector control interventions that target the aestivating mosquito population is shown to have the potential to enhance the impact of existing vector control.","1336":"Disturbances can facilitate biological invasions, with the associated increase in resource availability being a proposed cause. Here, we experimentally tested the interactive effects of disturbance regime (different frequencies of biomass removal at equal intensities) and resource abundance on invasion success using a factorial design containing five disturbance frequencies and three resource levels. We invaded populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens with two ecologically different invader morphotypes - a fast growing 'coloniser' type and a slower growing 'competitor' type. As resident populations were altered by the treatments, we additionally tested their effect on invader success. Disturbance frequency and resource abundance interacted to affect the success of both invaders, but this interaction differed between the invader types. The success of the coloniser type was positively affected by disturbance under high resources but negatively under low. However, disturbance negatively affected the success of the competitor type under high resource abundance but not under low or medium. Resident population changes did not alter invader success beyond direct treatment effects. We therefore demonstrate the same disturbance regime can either be beneficial or detrimental for an invader depending on both community resource abundance and its life-history. These results help explain some of the inconsistencies found in the disturbance-invasion literature.","1337":"There is growing concern about the over-prescription of opioids and the risks of long-term use. This study examined the relationship between initial need (pre-operative, post-operative, and discharge pain) and dosage of opioids in the first prescription after surgery with continued opioid use through opioid refills over 12 months, while considering patient-level characteristics. A total of 9262 opioid-na\u00efve patients underwent elective surgery, 7219 of whom were prescribed opioids following surgery. The results showed that 17% of patients received at least one opioid refill within one year post-surgery. Higher initial opioid doses, measured in morphine milligram equivalent (MME), were associated with a greater likelihood of continued use. Patients receiving a dose greater than 90 MME were 1.57 times more likely to receive a refill compared to those receiving less than 90 MME (95% confidence interval: 1.30-1.90, p < 0.001). Additionally, patients who experienced pain before or after surgery were more likely to receive opioid refills. Those experiencing moderate or severe pain were 1.66 times more likely to receive a refill (95% confidence interval: 1.45-1.91, p < 0.001). The findings highlight the need to consider surgery-related factors when prescribing opioids and the importance of developing strategies to balance the optimization of pain management with the risk of opioid-related harms.","1338":"On Jan 22, 2020, a day after the USA reported its first COVID-19 case, the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) launched the first global real-time coronavirus surveillance system: the JHU CSSE COVID-19 Dashboard. As of June 1, 2022, the dashboard has served the global audience for more than 30 consecutive months, totalling over 226 billion feature layer requests and 3\u00b76 billion page views. The highest daily record was set on March 29, 2020, with more than 69 billion requests and over 4\u00b76 billion views. This Personal View reveals the fundamental technical details of the entire data system underlying the dashboard, including data collection, data fusion logic, data curation and sharing, anomaly detection, data corrections, and the human resources required to support such an effort. The Personal View also covers the challenges, ranging from data visualisation to reporting standardisation. The details presented here help develop a framework for future, large-scale public health-related data collection and reporting.","1339":"Calibration is the process of estimating parameters of a mathematical model by matching model outputs to calibration targets. In the presence of nonidentifiability, multiple parameter sets solve the calibration problem, which may have important implications for decision making. We evaluate the implications of nonidentifiability on the optimal strategy and provide methods to check for nonidentifiability.In the presence of nonidentifiability, equally likely parameter estimates might yield different conclusions. Checking for the existence of nonidentifiability and its implications should be incorporated into standard model calibration procedures.When only RS is used as the calibration target, 2 different parameter sets yield similar maximum likelihood values. The high collinearity index and the bimodal likelihood profile on both parameters demonstrated the presence of nonidentifiability. These different, equally good-fitting parameter sets produce different estimates of the treatment effectiveness (0.67 v. 0.31 years), which could influence the optimal decision. By incorporating the additional target, the model becomes identifiable with a collinearity index of 3.5 and a unimodal likelihood profile.We illustrate nonidentifiability by calibrating a 3-state Markov model of cancer relative survival (RS). We performed 2 different calibration exercises: 1) only including RS as a calibration target and 2) adding the ratio between the 2 nondeath states over time as an additional target. We used the Nelder-Mead (NM) algorithm to identify parameter sets that best matched the calibration targets. We used collinearity and likelihood profile analyses to check for nonidentifiability. We then estimated the benefit of a hypothetical treatment in terms of life expectancy gains using different, but equally good-fitting, parameter sets. We also applied collinearity analysis to a realistic model of the natural history of colorectal cancer.","1340":"A systematic literature review was conducted to identify prevailing issues related to HEEs of vaccines. Furthermore, European experts in the field of health economics and immunization decision making were nominated and asked to select relevant aspects for discussion. Based on this, a workshop was held with these experts. Aspects on 'mathematical modelling', 'health economics' and 'decision making' were debated in group-work sessions (GWS) to formulate recommendations and\/or--if applicable--to state 'pros' and 'contras'.There was consensus that when HEEs are used to prioritize healthcare funding, this should be done in a consistent way across all interventions, including vaccines. However, proper evaluation of vaccines implies using tools that are not commonly used for therapeutic drugs. Due to the complexity of and uncertainties around vaccination, transparency in the documentation of HEEs and during subsequent decision making is essential.Incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses [health economic evaluations (HEEs)] of vaccines are routinely considered in decision making on immunization in various industrialized countries. While guidelines advocating more standardization of such HEEs (mainly for curative drugs) exist, several immunization-specific aspects (e.g. indirect effects or discounting approach) are still a subject of debate within the scientific community.The objective of this study was to develop a consensus framework for HEEs of vaccines to support the development of national guidelines in Europe.A total of 13 different aspects were identified for modelling and HEE: model selection, time horizon of models, natural disease history, measures of vaccine-induced protection, duration of vaccine-induced protection, indirect effects apart from herd protection, target population, model calibration and validation, handling uncertainty, discounting, health-related quality of life, cost components, and perspectives. For decision making, there were four aspects regarding the purpose and the integration of HEEs of vaccines in decision making as well as the variation of parameters within uncertainty analyses and the reporting of results from HEEs. For each aspect, background information and an expert consensus were formulated.","1341":"Based on a competing risks analysis, remdesivir reduced clinical deterioration (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59-0.91) and increased clinical improvement (hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.08, 1.39) relative to baseline. Our multistate models indicate that remdesivir inhibits worsening to ordinal scores of greater clinical severity among patients on room air or low-flow oxygen (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57-0.94) and among patients receiving mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygen\/noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.53-1.00) at baseline. We also find that remdesivir reduces expected intensive care respiratory therapy utilization among patients not mechanically ventilated at baseline.The Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial-1 (ACTT-1) found that remdesivir therapy hastened recovery in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, but the pathway for this improvement was not explored. We investigated how the dynamics of clinical progression changed along 4 pathways: recovery, improvement in respiratory therapy requirement, deterioration in respiratory therapy requirement, and death.We analyzed trajectories of daily ordinal severity scores reflecting oxygen requirements of 1051 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who participated in ACTT-1. We developed competing risks models that estimate the effect of remdesivir therapy on cumulative incidence of clinical improvement and deterioration, and multistate models that utilize the entirety of each patient's clinical course to characterize the effect of remdesivir on progression along the 4 pathways above.Remdesivir speeds time to recovery by preventing worsening to clinical states that would extend the course of hospitalization and increase intensive respiratory support, thereby reducing the overall demand for hospital care.","1342":"As of 3 September 2016, we had identified 339 qualifying acute respiratory illness events and 1463 (95%) participants remained in the study. Laboratory testing is ongoing.The cohort was enrolled in Suzhou and Yancheng, two cities in Jiangsu Province in Eastern China. Between November 2015 and March 2016, we enrolled 1532 adults who were 60-89 years of age, and collected blood samples along with baseline data on demographics, general health, chronic diseases, functional status and cognitive function through face-to-face interviews using a standardised questionnaire. Participants are being followed weekly throughout the year to identify acute respiratory illnesses. We schedule home visits to ill participants to collect mid-turbinate nasal and oropharyngeal swabs for laboratory testing and detailed symptom information for the acute illness. Regular follow-up including face-to-face interviews and further blood draws will take place every 6-12 months.This study was established to provide direct evidence on the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in older adults in two cities in Jiangsu Province, China, and the potential impact of acute respiratory infections on frailty.We plan to conduct laboratory testing to estimate the incidence of influenza virus and RSV infections in older adults. We plan to investigate the impact of these infections on frailty and functional status to determine the association of pre-existing immune status with protection against influenza and RSV infection in unvaccinated older adults, and to assess the exposure to avian influenza viruses in this population.","1343":"Program costs were $2.19 per vaccine-eligible person and increased absolute vaccination likelihood by 7.5%. Delphi panel estimates and trial data informed vaccine effectiveness values. Analyses took a healthcare perspective, discounting at 3%\/year over a lifetime time horizon.Multiple factors, such as less complex U.S. adult pneumococcal recommendations that could increase vaccination rates, childhood pneumococcal vaccination indirect effects that decrease adult vaccination impact, and increased vaccine hesitancy (particularly in underserved minorities), could diminish the cost-effectiveness of programs to increase pneumococcal vaccination in older adults. Prior analyses supported the economic favorability of these programs.A Markov model compared no vaccination and current recommendations (either 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV20] alone or 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine plus the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine [PCV15\/PPSV23]) without or with programs to increase vaccine uptake in Black and non-Black 65-year-old cohorts. Pre-pandemic population- and serotype-specific pneumococcal disease risk and illness\/vaccine costs came from U.S.Uptake programs decreased pneumococcal disease overall. In Black cohorts, PCV20 without program cost $216,805 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained compared with no vaccination; incremental cost-effectiveness was $245,546\/QALY for PCV20 with program and $425,264\/QALY for PCV15\/PPSV23 with program. In non-Black cohorts, all strategies cost >$200,000\/QALY gained. When considering the potential indirect effects from childhood vaccination, all strategies became less economically attractive. Increased vaccination with less complex strategies had negligible effects. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, current recommendations with or without programs were unlikely to be favored at thresholds <$200,000\/QALY gained.Current U.S. pneumococcal vaccination recommendations for older adults were unlikely to be economically reasonable with or without programs to increase vaccine uptake. Alternatives to current pneumococcal vaccines that include pneumococcal serotypes associated with adult disease should be considered.","1344":"Due to limited Hepatitis C sequence availability from patients in Russia, the relationship between subtypes and baseline resistance associated substitutions to direct antiretroviral treatment outcome is not fully understood.HCV GT1b and GT3a sequences in Russia were related to strains in Europe and Asia. GT1a and GT2a had a low prevalence in Russia. In GT1b, the prevalence of NS5A Y93H was lower in Russia (6%) compared with Asia (15%). The prevalence of NS5B L159F was similar between Russia and Europe (26-39%). GT3a RAS prevalence was similar between Russia and Asia, Europe and North America. The 2k\/1b recombinant strain in Russia were related to strains of Europe. A higher prevalence of the NS5A RAS L31M (10%) was observed in 2k\/1b sequences compared to GT1b (1-6%).Deep sequencing of HCV NS3, NS5A and NS5B sequences was performed on plasma HCV samples from 412 DAA-na\u00efve patients from Russia. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to investigate sequence similarities between HCV stains from Russia, Asia, Europe and North America. Pretreatment HCV RAS was assessed with a 15% cutoff.The prevalence of RASs and the phylogenetic analysis showed similarities in HCV strains between Russia, Europe and North America. This information may be useful for HCV regimens in Russia.","1345":"The new variant COVID-19 has likely been introduced by travelers from the UK and spreading undetected for months in many countries.A fast-spreading SARS-CoV-2 variant identified in the United Kingdom in December 2020 has raised international alarm.

To do so, we develop a climatologically driven disease transmission framework for dengue virus using spatially resolved temperature and precipitation data as well as the time-series susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. From this framework, we first demonstrate that the distinct climatological patterns encountered across the island play an important role in establishing the typical yearly temporal dynamics of dengue, but alone are unable to account for the epidemic case numbers observed in Sri Lanka during 2017. Using a simplified two-strain SIR model, we demonstrate that the re-introduction of a dengue virus serotype that had been largely absent from the island in previous years may have played an important role in driving the epidemic, and provide a discussion of the possible roles for extreme weather events and human mobility patterns on the outbreak dynamics. Lastly, we provide estimates for the future burden of dengue across Sri Lanka using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Phase 5 climate projections. Critically, we demonstrate that climatological and serological factors can act synergistically to yield greater projected case numbers than would be expected from the presence of a single driver alone. Altogether, this work provides a holistic framework for teasing apart and analysing the various complex drivers of vector-borne disease outbreak dynamics.","1347":"We began with two papers that reviewed the usage of 'symbiosis' and related terms in the biology and ecology literature and prominent textbooks. We then analyzed several prominent standard terminologies and ontologies that contain representations of symbiotic interactions, to determine if they appropriately defined 'symbiosis' and related terms according to current scientific usage as identified by the review papers. In the process, we identified several subtypes of symbiotic interactions, as well as the characteristics that differentiate them, which we used to propose textual and axiomatic definitions for each subtype of interaction. To both illustrate how to use the ontological representations and definitions we created and provide additional quality assurance on key definitions, we carried out a referent tracking analysis and representation of three scenarios involving symbiotic interactions among organisms.The symbiotic interactions that occur between humans and organisms in our environment have a tremendous impact on our health. Recently, there has been a surge in interest in understanding the complex relationships between the microbiome and human health and host immunity against microbial pathogens, among other things. To collect and manage data about these interactions and their complexity, scientists will need ontologies that represent symbiotic interactions as they occur in reality.We found one definition of 'symbiosis' in an existing ontology that was consistent with the vast preponderance of scientific usage in biology and ecology. However, that ontology changed its definition during the course of our work, and discussions are ongoing. We present a new definition that we have proposed. We also define 34 subtypes of symbiosis. Our referent tracking analysis showed that it is necessary to define symbiotic interactions at the level of the individual, rather than at the species level, due to the\u00a0complex nature in which organisms can go from participating in one type of symbiosis with one organism to participating in another type of symbiosis with a different organism.As a result of our efforts here, we have developed a robust representation of symbiotic interactions using a realism-based approach, which fills a gap in existing biomedical ontologies.","1348":"The outbreak occurred in February 2013 in the Faratsiho district of Madagascar and involved 22 cases, including three untreated fatalities. The 19 other cases participated in funeral practices for the fatal cases and fully recovered after combination antimicrobial therapy: intramuscular streptomycin followed by oral co-trimoxazole. The Y. pestis strain that circulated during this outbreak is resistant to streptomycin resulting from a spontaneous point mutation in the 30S ribosomal protein S12 (rpsL) gene. This same mutation causes streptomycin resistance in two unrelated Y. pestis strains, one isolated from a fatal PP case in a different region of Madagascar in 1987 and another isolated from a fatal PP case in China in 1996, documenting this mutation has occurred independently at least three times in Y. pestis. Laboratory experiments revealed this mutation has no detectable impact on fitness or virulence, and revertants to wild-type are rare in other species containing it, suggesting Y. pestis strains containing it could persist in the environment.Unique AMR strains of Y. pestis continue to arise in Madagascar and can be transmitted during PP outbreaks.A PP outbreak in Madagascar involving transmission of a Y. pestis strain resistant to streptomycin, the current recommended first-line treatment in Madagascar, was retrospectively characterized using epidemiology, clinical diagnostics, molecular characterization, and animal studies.Pneumonic plague (PP), caused by Yersinia pestis, is the most feared clinical form of plague due to its rapid lethality and potential to cause outbreaks. PP outbreaks are now rare due to antimicrobial therapy.","1349":"The University of California San Francisco Committee on Human Research and the Khon Kaen University Institutional Review Board have given ethical approval. The results of this trial will be presented at local and international meetings and submitted for peer-reviewed journals for publication.The Systemic and Topical Control of Cytomegalovirus Anterior uveitis: Treatment Outcomes (STACCATO) trial is designed as a multicentre, block randomised by site, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial comparing the efficacy of oral valganciclovir, 2% topical ganciclovir and placebo in treating PCR-proven CMV anterior uveitis. Participant clinical evaluation will occur at three study time points by a masked study ophthalmologist over a 28-day period to assess resolution of ocular inflammation (secondary outcome). A control group will provide additional information about the possible impact that the infected host's immune response may play in controlling local viral replication. The primary analysis is an analysis of covariance (three arms) correcting for baseline to compare quantitative CMV viral load in the anterior chamber (AC) aqueous fluid before and 7\u2009days after treatment.NCT03576898.Cytomegalovirus (CMV) anterior uveitis is a recognised cause of anterior uveitis in immunocompetent patients and is preventable cause of vision loss. Ocular sequelae include corneal endothelial damage which can cause corneal oedema and failure, as well as glaucoma. Recurrences of inflammation are common and therefore patients are often exposed to long-term therapy. Oral therapy is available in the form of valganciclovir, although with the caveat of systemic side effects such as bone marrow suppression and renal failure necessitating regular interval laboratory monitoring. Recent reports have demonstrated that topical 2% ganciclovir solution may offer promising treatment outcomes in patients with CMV anterior uveitis with superior safety, cost-effectiveness and convenience profiles. An investigation into the relative equipoise of these therapies is warranted for these reasons.","1350":"Background Knowledge of real-world antihypertensive use is limited to prevalent hypertension, limiting our understanding of how treatment evolves and its contribution to persistently poor blood pressure control. We sought to characterize antihypertensive initiation among new users. Methods and Results Using Medicaid and Medicare data from the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Consortium, we identified new users of \u22651 first-line antihypertensives (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin receptor blocker, thiazide diuretic, or \u03b2-blocker) between 2013 and 2021 among adults with diagnosed hypertension, and no antihypertensive fill during the prior 12\u2009months. We evaluated initial antihypertensive regimens by class and drug overall and across study years and examined variation in antihypertensive initiation across demographics (sex, race, and ethnicity) and comorbidity (chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease). We identified 143\u2009054 patients initiating 188\u2009995 antihypertensives (75% monotherapy; 25% combination therapy), with mean age 59\u2009years and 57% of whom were women. The most commonly initiated antihypertensive class overall was angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (39%) followed by \u03b2-blockers (31%), calcium channel blockers (24%), thiazides (19%), and angiotensin receptor blockers (11%). With the exception of \u03b2-blockers, a single drug accounted for \u226575% of use of each class. \u03b2-blocker use decreased (35%-26%), and calcium channel blocker use increased (24%-28%) over the study period, while initiation of most other classes remained relatively stable. We also observed significant differences in antihypertensive selection across demographic and comorbidity strata. Conclusions These findings indicate that substantial variation exists in initial antihypertensive prescribing, and there remain significant gaps between current guideline recommendations and real-world implementation in early hypertension care.","1351":"Establishing how many people have already been infected by SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent priority for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Patchy virological testing has hampered interpretation of confirmed case counts, and unknown rates of asymptomatic and mild infections make it challenging to develop evidence-based public health policies. Serological tests that identify past infection can be used to estimate cumulative incidence, but the relative accuracy and robustness of various sampling strategies has been unclear. Here, we used a flexible framework that integrates uncertainty from test characteristics, sample size, and heterogeneity in seroprevalence across tested subpopulations to compare estimates from sampling schemes. Using the same framework and making the assumption that serological positivity indicates immune protection, we propagated these estimates and uncertainty through dynamical models to assess the uncertainty in the epidemiological parameters needed to evaluate public health interventions. We examined the relative accuracy of convenience samples versus structured surveys to estimate population seroprevalence, and found that sampling schemes informed by demographics and contact networks outperform uniform sampling. The framework can be adapted to optimize the design of serological surveys given particular test characteristics and capacity, population demography, sampling strategy, and modeling approach, and can be tailored to support decision-making around introducing or removing interventions.","1352":"Gene flow is widely thought to homogenize spatially separate populations, eroding effects of divergent selection. The resulting theory of \u0091migration\u0096selection balance\u0092 is predicated on a common assumption that all genotypes are equally prone to dispersal. If instead certain genotypes are disproportionately likely to disperse, then migration can actually promote population divergence. For example, previous work has shown that threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) differ in their propensity to move up\u2010 or downstream (\u0091rheotactic response\u0092), which may facilitate genetic divergence between adjoining lake and stream populations of stickleback. Here, we demonstrate that intraspecific variation in a sensory system (superficial neuromast lines) contributes to this variation in swimming behaviour in stickleback. First, we show that intact neuromasts are necessary for a typical rheotactic response. Next, we showed that there is heritable variation in the number of neuromasts and that stickleback with more neuromasts are more likely to move downstream. Variation in pectoral fin shape contributes to additional variation in rheotactic response. These results illustrate how within\u2010population quantitative variation in sensory and locomotor traits can influence dispersal behaviour, thereby biasing dispersal between habitats and favouring population divergence.","1353":"Adults with HIV receiving care at four selected community clinics in Alabama will receive a telephone-delivered alcohol brief intervention (BI), and then be assigned at random (stratified by clinic and sex) to no further intervention or T-CETA. Participants will be recruited after screening positively for unhealthy alcohol use or when referred by a provider. The target sample size is 308. The primary outcome will be change in the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) at six- and 12-months post-enrollment. Additional outcomes include HIV (retention in care and viral suppression), patient-reported mental health (anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress), and quality of life. A range of implementation measures be evaluated including T-CETA provider and client acceptability, feasibility, cost and cost-effectiveness.This trial will inform alcohol treatment within HIV care programs, including the need to consider comorbidities, and the potential impact of alcohol interventions on HIV and quality of life outcomes.Unhealthy alcohol use is an unaddressed barrier to achieving and maintaining control of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic. Integrated screening, treatment of common behavioral and mental health comorbidities, and telemedicine can improve alcohol treatment and HIV clinical and quality of life outcomes for rural and underserved populations.In a randomized controlled clinical trial, we will evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of telephone-delivered Common Elements Treatment Approach (T-CETA), a transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy protocol, on unhealthy alcohol use, HIV, other substance use and mental health outcomes among predominantly rural adults with HIV receiving care at community clinics in Alabama.","1354":"Traffic density estimation is a very important component of an automated traffic monitoring system. Traffic density estimation can be used in a number of traffic applications \u0096 from congestion identification to macroscopic traffic control in urban environment. In this paper, we implemented Single Shot Detection (SSD) and MobileNet-SSD to estimate traffic density. SSD is capable of handling different shape, size and view angle of the objects. MobileNet-SSD is a cross-trained model from SSD to MobileNet architecture, which is faster than SSD. In this study, we show a key application area for the SSD and MobileNet-SSD framework. The advantages and shortcomings of the SSD and MobileNet-SSD framework were analyzed using fifty-nine individual traffic cameras. In addition, we compared the two algorithms with manually estimated density. The SSD framework shows significant potential in the field of traffic density estimation. SSD achieved 92.97% average detection accuracy in our experiment. On the other hand, the MobileNet-SSD achieved 79.30% average detection accuracy.","1355":"We first conducted a narrative review of the published literature. A search was performed using PubMed and APA PsycInfo. We then convened two expert panels consisting of people with lived experience and people who work with people who were previously incarcerated. Experts were asked to evaluate the literature derived factors for completeness and add factors that were not identified. Finally, we categorized factors as either intermediary or structural according to the World Health Organization's Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Framework.We identified 13 papers that met our inclusion criteria for the narrative review. Within these 13 papers, we identified 22 relevant factors for their role in the relationship between overdose and people with a history of incarceration, 16 were risk factors and six were protective factors. Five of these were structural factors (three risk and two protective) and 17 were intermediary factors (13 risk and four protective). The expert panels identified 21 additional factors, 10 of which were structural (six risk and four protective) and 11 of which were intermediary (eight risk and three protective).People with a history of incarceration are at high risk for opioid overdose. A variety of factors contribute to this elevated risk though our understanding of these factors is deficient. Research to identify risk and protective factors for overdose is often conducted using administrative data or researcher-derived surveys and without explicit input from people with lived experience. We aimed to understand the scope of U.S. research on factors associated with opioid overdose among previously incarcerated people. We did this by conducting a narrative review of the literature and convening expert panels of people with lived experience. We then categorized these factors using a social determinants of health framework to help contextualize our findings.This narrative review along with expert panels demonstrates a gap in the published literature regarding factors associated with overdose among people who were previously incarcerated. Additionally, this review highlights a substantial gap with regard to the types of factors that are typically identified. Incorporating voices of people with lived experience is crucial to our understanding of overdose in this at-risk population.","1356":"Most HIV-1-infected individuals with virological failure on a pharmacologically-boosted protease inhibitor (PI) regimen do not develop PI-resistance protease mutations. One proposed explanation is that HIV-1 gag or gp41 cytoplasmic domain mutations might also reduce PI susceptibility. In a recent study of paired gag and gp41 sequences from individuals with virological failure on a PI regimen, we did not identify PI-selected mutations and concluded that if such mutations existed, larger numbers of paired sequences from multiple studies would be needed for their identification. In this study, we generated site-specific amino acid profiles using gag and gp41 published sequences from 5,338 and 4,242 ART-na\u00efve individuals, respectively, to assist researchers identify unusual mutations arising during therapy and to provide scripts for performing established and novel maximal likelihood estimates of dN\/dS substitution rates in paired sequences. The pipelines used to generate the curated sequences, amino acid profiles, and dN\/dS analyses will facilitate the application of consistent methods to paired gag and gp41 sequence datasets and expedite the identification of potential sites under PI-selection pressure.","1357":"The IMPACC cohort, composed of >1,000 hospitalized COVID-19 participants, contains five illness trajectory groups (TGs) during acute infection (first 28\u00a0days), ranging from milder (TG1-3) to more severe disease course (TG4) and death (TG5). Here, we report deep immunophenotyping, profiling of >15,000 longitudinal blood and nasal samples from 540 participants of the IMPACC cohort, using 14 distinct assays. These unbiased analyses identify cellular and molecular signatures present within 72\u00a0h of hospital admission that distinguish moderate from severe and fatal COVID-19 disease. Importantly, cellular and molecular states also distinguish participants with more severe disease that recover or stabilize within 28\u00a0days from those that progress to fatal outcomes (TG4 vs. TG5). Furthermore, our longitudinal design reveals that these biologic states display distinct temporal patterns associated with clinical outcomes. Characterizing host immune responses in relation to heterogeneity in disease course may inform clinical prognosis and opportunities for intervention.","1358":"We conducted a systematic review of published CVD mortality studies that reported ASMR as an indicator for premature mortality measurement. All English articles published as of October 2022 were searched in four electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). We computed pooled estimates of ASMR using random-effects meta-analysis. We assessed heterogeneity from the selected studies using the I2 statistic. Subgroup analyses and meta regression analysis was performed based on sex, main CVD types, income country level, study time and age group. The analysis was performed using R software with the \"meta\" and \"metafor\" packages.Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a significant cause of premature mortality worldwide, with a growing burden in recent years. Despite this, there is a lack of comprehensive meta-analyses that quantify the extent of premature CVD mortality. Study addressed this gap by estimating the pooled age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) of premature CVD mortality.This meta-analysis synthesized a comprehensive estimate of the worldwide burden of premature CVD mortality. Our findings underscore the continued burden of premature CVD mortality, particularly in middle-income countries. Addressing this issue requires targeted interventions to mitigate the high risk of premature CVD mortality in these vulnerable populations.A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. The estimated global ASMR for premature mortality from total CVD was 96.04 per 100,000 people (95% CI: 67.18, 137.31). Subgroup analysis by specific CVD types revealed a higher ASMR for ischemic heart disease (ASMR\u2009=\u200915.57, 95% CI: 11.27, 21.5) compared to stroke (ASMR\u2009=\u200912.36, 95% CI: 8.09, 18.91). Sex-specific differences were also observed, with higher ASMRs for males (37.50, 95% CI: 23.69, 59.37) than females (15.75, 95% CI: 9.61, 25.81). Middle-income countries had a significantly higher ASMR (90.58, 95% CI: 56.40, 145.48) compared to high-income countries (21.42, 95% CI: 15.63, 29.37). Stratifying by age group indicated that the age groups of 20-64\u00a0years and 30-74\u00a0years had a higher ASMR than the age group of 0-74\u00a0years. Our multivariable meta-regression model suggested significant differences in the adjusted ASMR estimates for all covariates except study time.","1359":"Of the 70 study subjects with fungal keratitis, 25\/69 (36%) remained culture positive at day 3, and 20\/62 (32%) were culture positive at day 7. Culture positivity at day 3 conferred a hazard ratio of 2.8 for requiring TPK (p=0.03), but was not a statistically significant predictor of perforation, scar size, or final visual acuity. Culture positivity at day 7 had a hazard ratio of 3.5 for requiring TPK (p=0.003). Those with positive cultures at day 7 had on average 3-LogMAR lines worse visual acuity at 3 months (95% CI 0.9 to 5.2-LogMAR lines, p=0.006) and 1.1 mm larger scar size at 3 months after controlling for baseline measures (95% CI 0.1 to 2.2 mm; p=0.03).To evaluate the utility of repeat cultures at days 3 and 7 after starting antifungal medications for predicting outcomes in fungal keratitis.Patients presenting to Aravind Eye Hospital, Pondicherry with fungal keratitis and visual acuity worse than 20\/70 received topical natamycin and were randomized to either receive intrastromal injection of voriconazole or topical therapy alone. All subjects received corneal cultures at date of presentation, day 3, and day 7. Outcome measures included 3-week and 3-month visual acuity and scar size, corneal perforation and\/or the need for therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty (TPK). Visual acuity and scar size were analyzed with multiple linear regression controlling for baseline measures. Survival analysis was used to analyze the risk of corneal perforation and\/or need for TPK.While not as predictive as day 7 cultures, culture positivity at day 3 after starting treatment is a significant predictor of the need for TPK in patients with moderate to severe filamentous fungal keratitis. This has applications for risk stratification, and may facilitate earlier consideration of TPK in high-risk patients.Pre-specified secondary analysis of the randomized clinical trial Mycotic Antimicrobial Localized Injection trial.","1360":"There is a wide spectrum of long-term cardiac symptoms following COVID-19. Findings of existing studies are strongly related to study quality, size and design, underscoring the need for high-quality epidemiologic studies to characterize these symptoms and understand their etiology.There is growing body of literature on the long-term cardiac symptoms following COVID-19. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize and evaluate related evidence to inform clinical management and future studies.We searched two preprint and seven peer-reviewed article databases from January 1, 2020 to January 8, 2022 for studies investigating cardiac symptoms that persisted for at least 4 weeks among individuals who survived COVID-19. A customized Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to evaluate the quality of included studies. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to estimate the proportion of symptoms with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and stratified analyses were conducted to quantify the proportion of symptoms by study characteristics and quality.A total of 101 studies describing 49 unique long-term cardiac symptoms met the inclusion criteria. Based on quality assessment, only 15.8% of the studies (n=16) were of high quality, and most studies scored poorly on sampling representativeness. The two most examined symptoms were chest pain and arrhythmia. Meta-analysis showed that the proportion of chest pain was 10.1% (95% CI: 6.4-15.5) and arrhythmia was 9.8% (95% CI: 5.4-17.2). Stratified analyses showed that studies with low-quality score, small sample size, unsystematic sampling method, and cross-sectional design were most likely to report high proportions of symptoms. For example, the proportion of chest pain was 21.3% (95% CI: 10.5-38.5), 9.3% (95% CI: 6.0-14.0), and 4.0% (95% CI: 1.3-12.0) in studies with low, medium, and high-quality scores, respectively. Similar patterns were observed for other cardiac symptoms including hypertension, cardiac abnormalities, myocardial injury, thromboembolism, stroke, heart failure, coronary disease, and myocarditis.","1361":"SARS-CoV-2 transmission is largely driven by heterogeneous dynamics at a local scale, leaving local health departments to design interventions with limited information. We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomes sampled between February 2020 and March 2022 jointly with epidemiological and cell phone mobility data to investigate fine scale spatiotemporal SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in King County, Washington, a diverse, metropolitan US county. We applied an approximate structured coalescent approach to model transmission within and between North King County and South King County alongside the rate of outside introductions into the county. Our phylodynamic analyses reveal that following stay-at-home orders, the epidemic trajectories of North and South King County began to diverge. We find that South King County consistently had more reported and estimated cases, COVID-19 hospitalizations, and longer persistence of local viral transmission when compared to North King County, where viral importations from outside drove a larger proportion of new cases. Using mobility and demographic data, we also find that South King County experienced a more modest and less sustained reduction in mobility following stay-at-home orders than North King County, while also bearing more socioeconomic inequities that might contribute to a disproportionate burden of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Overall, our findings suggest a role for local-scale phylodynamics in understanding the heterogeneous transmission landscape.Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in King County, Washington show that diverse areas in the same metropolitan region can have different epidemic dynamics.","1362":"Spatial connectivity is an important consideration when modelling infectious disease data across a geographical region. Connectivity can arise for many reasons, including shared characteristics between regions and human or vector movement. Bayesian hierarchical models include structured random effects to account for spatial connectivity. However, conventional approaches require the spatial structure to be fully defined prior to model fitting. By applying penalized smoothing splines to coordinates, we create two-dimensional smooth surfaces describing the spatial structure of the data while making minimal assumptions about the structure. The result is a non-stationary surface which is setting specific. These surfaces can be incorporated into a hierarchical modelling framework and interpreted similarly to traditional random effects. Through simulation studies, we show that the splines can be applied to any symmetric continuous connectivity measure, including measures of human movement, and that the models can be extended to explore multiple sources of spatial structure in the data. Using Bayesian inference and simulation, the relative contribution of each spatial structure can be computed and used to generate hypotheses about the drivers of disease. These models were found to perform at least as well as existing modelling frameworks, while allowing for future extensions and multiple sources of spatial connectivity.","1363":"Many genera of terrestrial vertebrates diversified exclusively on one or the other side of Wallace's Line, which lies between Borneo and Sulawesi islands in Southeast Asia, and demarcates one of the sharpest biogeographic transition zones in the world. Macaque monkeys are unusual among vertebrate genera in that they are distributed on both sides of Wallace's Line, raising the question of whether dispersal across this barrier was an evolutionary one-off or a more protracted exchange-and if the latter, what were the genomic consequences. To explore the nature of speciation over the edge of this biogeographic divide, we used genomic data to test for evidence of gene flow between macaque species across Wallace's Line after macaques colonized Sulawesi. We recovered evidence of post-colonization gene flow, most prominently on the X chromosome. These results are consistent with the proposal that gene flow is a pervasive component of speciation-even when barriers to gene flow seem almost insurmountable.","1364":"We conducted a retrospective population-based study to describe longitudinal patterns of prevalence, incidence, discontinuation, resumption, and durability of substantial HIV risk behaviors (SHR) for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) eligibility.The study was conducted among HIV-negative study participants aged 15-49 years who participated in survey rounds of the Rakai Community Cohort Study between August 2011 and June 2018. Substantial HIV risk was defined based on the Uganda national PrEP eligibility as reporting sexual intercourse with >1 partner of unknown HIV status, nonmarital sex without a condom, having genital ulcers, or having transactional sex. Resumption of SHR meant resuming of SHR after stopping SHR, whereas persistence of SHR meant SHR on >1 consecutive visit. We used generalized estimation equations with log-binomial regression models and robust variance to estimate survey-specific prevalence ratios; Generalized estimation equations with modified Poisson regression models and robust variance to estimate incidence ratios for incidence, discontinuation, and resumption of PrEP eligibility.Incidence of PrEP eligibility increased from 11.4\/100 person-years (pys) in the first intersurvey period to 13.9\/100 pys (adjusted incidence rate ratios = 1.28; 95%CI = 1.10-1.30) and declined to 12.6\/100 pys (adjusted incidence rate ratios = 1.06; 95%CI = 0.98-1.15) in the second and third intersurvey periods, respectively. Discontinuation rates of SHR for PrEP eligibility were stable (ranging 34.9\/100 pys-37.3\/100 pys; P = 0.207), whereas resumption reduced from 25.0\/100 pys to 14.5\/100 pys ( P < 0.001). PrEP eligibility episodes lasted a median time of 20 months (IQR = 10-51).Pre-exposure prophylaxis use should be tailored to the dynamic nature of PrEP eligibility. Preventive-effective adherence should be adopted for assessment of attrition in PrEP programs.","1365":"The RNA-activated protein kinase, PKR, is a key mediator of the innate immunity response to viral infection. Viral double-stranded RNAs induce PKR dimerization and autophosphorylation. The PKR kinase domain forms a back-to-back dimer. However, intermolecular ( trans) autophosphorylation is not feasible in this arrangement. We have obtained PKR kinase structures that resolves this dilemma. The kinase protomers interact via the known back-to-back interface as well as a front-to-front interface that is formed by exchange of activation segments. Mutational analysis of the front-to-front interface support a functional role in PKR activation. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the activation segment is highly dynamic in the front-to-front dimer and can adopt conformations conducive to phosphoryl transfer. We propose a mechanism where back-to-back dimerization induces a conformational change that activates PKR to phosphorylate a \"substrate\" kinase docked in a front-to-front geometry. This mechanism may be relevant to related kinases that phosphorylate the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2\u03b1.","1366":"Limited research has evaluated these equitable policies because of the difficulty of capturing LGBTQ patient experience. Previous studies have shown that LGBTQ persons report increased rates of discrimination across a wide variety of healthcare settings which may prevent them from disclosing their LGBTQ status. The goal of this research was to use a social media big dataset to evaluate the impact of equitable policies on patient experiences for LGBTQ persons.","1367":"DNA testing of eschars represents an under-utilized diagnostic test and may aid in cases where the diagnosis is not made clinically.Infection with Rickettsia parkeri is an emerging tick-borne illness, often accompanied by fever and an eschar at the site of tick attachment. We present three cases of R. parkeri in Virginia residents.Case 1 presented initially afebrile, failed to seroconvert to rickettsial antigens, and was diagnosed by DNA testing of the eschar. Case 2 presented febrile with eschar, no serologies were performed, and was diagnosed by DNA testing of the eschar. Case 3 presented febrile with eschar, serologies were negative for rickettsial antigens, and was diagnosed by DNA testing of the eschar.","1368":"During 1970-2012, we identified 318 outbreaks (average: 7 outbreaks\/year; range: 1-19). Most outbreaks were reported in the Latin America and the Caribbean region (36%), followed by Southern Asia (13%), and North America (11%). Most outbreaks were located in tropical and subtropical ecoregions (55%). Quality classification showed that there was clear description of laboratory-confirmed cases in 40% of outbreaks. Among those, the average outbreak size was 82 cases overall (range: 2-2 259) but reached 253 cases in tropical\/subtropical ecoregions. Common risk factors included outdoor work activities (25%), exposure to floodwaters (23%), and recreational exposure to water (22%). Epidemiologic investigation was conducted in 80% of outbreaks, mainly as case interviews. Case fatality was 5% overall (range: 0%-60%).We conducted a systematic review of leptospirosis outbreaks reported in the scientific literature and ProMED during 1970-2012. Predefined criteria were used to identify and classify outbreaks and a standard form was used to extract information.This review describes the geographic and temporal distribution of, detection methods for, and other epidemiological features of published leptospirosis outbreaks, with the aim of informing efforts to standardize outbreak-reporting practices.Outbreak reporting increased over the study period with outbreaks covering tropical and non-tropical regions. Outbreaks varied by size, setting, and risk factors; however, data reviewed often had limited information regarding diagnosis and epidemiology. Guidelines are recommended to develop standardized procedures for diagnostic and epidemiological investigations during an outbreak and for reporting.","1369":"Background Stroke is a significant public health concern characterized by increasing mortality and morbidity. Accurate long-term outcome prediction for acute stroke patients, particularly stroke mortality, is vital for clinical decision-making and prognostic management. This study aimed to develop and compare various prognostic models for stroke mortality prediction. Methods In a retrospective cohort study from January 2016 to December 2021, we collected data from patients diagnosed with acute stroke from five selected hospitals. Data contained variables on\u00a0demographics, comorbidities, and interventions\u00a0retrieved from medical records. The cohort comprised 950 patients with 20 features. Outcomes (censored vs. death) were determined by linking data with the Malaysian National Mortality Registry.\u00a0We employed three common survival modeling approaches, the Cox proportional hazard regression (Cox), support vector machine (SVM), and random survival forest (RSF), while enhancing the Cox model with Elastic Net (Cox-EN) for feature selection. Models were compared using the concordance index (C-index), time-dependent area under the curve (AUC), and discrimination index (D-index), with calibration assessed by the Brier score. Results The support vector machine (SVM) model excelled among the four, with three-month, one-year, and three-year time-dependent AUC values of 0.842, 0.846, and 0.791; a D-index of 5.31 (95% CI: 3.86, 7.30); and a C-index of 0.803 (95% CI: 0.758, 0.847). All models exhibited robust calibration, with three-month, one-year, and three-year Brier scores ranging from 0.103 to 0.220, all below 0.25. Conclusion The support vector machine (SVM) model demonstrated superior discriminative performance, suggesting its efficacy in developing prognostic models for stroke mortality. This study enhances stroke mortality prediction and supports clinical decision-making, emphasizing the utility of the support vector machine method.","1370":"In this community-based cohort study of 275 primarily low-income, urban households in New York City, overall 2013-2014 influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) was 62.5% (95% confidence interval, 21.7%-82.0%). VE point estimates were highest against 2009 H1N1 and for those who were vaccinated in 2013-2014 but not in 2012-2013. ","1371":"We analyzed rates of influenza and other viral causes of respiratory infections among HCP working in outpatient sites at 4 VA health systems without mandatory influenza vaccination policies and 3 non-VA health systems with mandatory influenza vaccination policies.Influenza vaccination was associated with a decreased risk of influenza (odds ratio, 0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-0.22) but an increased risk of other respiratory viral infections (incidence rate ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.02-1.57).Our fitted regression models suggest that if influenza vaccination rates in clinics where vaccination was not mandated had equalled those where vaccine was mandated, HCP influenza infections would have been reduced by 52.1% (95% CI, 51.3%-53.0%). These observations, their possible causes, and additional strategies to reduce influenza and other viral respiratory illnesses among HCP working in ambulatory clinics warrant further investigation.The implementation of mandatory influenza vaccination policies among healthcare personnel (HCP) is controversial.

Multivariate methods can borrow strength across responses and may produce improved longitudinal forecasts of disease progression over univariate methods. We explore the performance of our proposed model under simulation, and demonstrate that it has improved prediction accuracy over traditional Bayesian hierarchical models. We further identify an appropriate model selection criterion. We show that our method holds promise for use in the clinical setting, particularly when ordinal outcomes are measured alongside other variables types that may aid clinical decision making. This approach is particularly applicable when multiple, imperfect measures of disease progression are available.","1373":"We estimated that Israel's vaccination campaign averted 158\u2008665 (95% CI 144\u2008640-172\u2008690) SARS-CoV-2 infections, 24\u2008597 (18\u2008942-30\u2008252) hospitalisations, 17\u2008432 (12\u2008770-22\u2008094) severe or critical hospitalisations, and 5532 (3085-7982) deaths. 16\u2008213 (65\u00b79%) of 24\u2008597 hospitalisations and 5035 (91\u00b70%) of 5532 of deaths averted were estimated to be among those aged 65 years and older. We estimated 116\u2008000 (73\u00b71%) SARS-CoV-2 infections, 19\u2008467 (79\u00b71%) COVID-19-related hospitalisations, and 4351 (79%) deaths averted were accounted for by the fully vaccinated population.On Dec 20, 2020, Israel initiated a nationwide COVID-19 vaccination campaign for people aged 16 years and older and exclusively used the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (tozinameran). We provide estimates of the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related admissions to hospital (ie, hospitalisations) and deaths averted by the nationwide vaccination campaign.Without the national vaccination campaign, Israel probably would have had triple the number of hospitalisations and deaths compared with what actually occurred during its largest wave of the pandemic to date, and the health-care system might have become overwhelmed. Indirect effects and long-term benefits of the programme, which could be substantial, were not included in these estimates and warrant future research.In this retrospective surveillance study, we used national surveillance data routinely collected by the Israeli Ministry of Health from the first 112 days (Dec 20, 2020, up to our data cutoff of April 10, 2021) of Israel's vaccination campaign to estimate the averted burden of four outcomes: SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospitalisations, severe or critical hospitalisations, and deaths. As part of the campaign, all individuals aged 16 years and older were eligible for inoculation with the BNT162b2 vaccine in a two-dose schedule 21 days apart. We estimated the direct effects of the immunisation programme for all susceptible individuals (ie, with no previous evidence of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection) who were at least partly vaccinated (at least one dose and at least 14 days of follow-up after the first dose). We estimated the number of SARS-CoV-2 infection-related outcomes averted on the basis of cumulative daily, age-specific rate differences, comparing rates among unvaccinated individuals with those of at least partly vaccinated individuals for each of the four outcomes and the (age-specific) size of the susceptible population and proportion that was at least partly vaccinated.Israel Ministry of Health and Pfizer.","1374":"UTT was not associated with an increase in drug resistance in this cohort. Higher rates of drug resistance and multi-class resistance were observed in non-seroconverters compared to seroconverters.Genotyping results were obtained for 758 participants (143 seroconverters; 534 non-seroconverters; and 81 unknown duration of infection). The estimated prevalence of resistance in the study communities was 37% for all viremic persons and 11% for all HIV-positive persons. There was no association between UTT and drug resistance. Resistance was detected in 14.0% of seroconverters and 40.8% of non-seroconverters (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance: 14.0% and 39.9%; nucleoside\/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance: 0.7% and 15.5%; protease inhibitor resistance: 0% and 1.9%; multi-class resistance: 0.7% and 16.1%, respectively). ARV drugs were detected in 2\/139 (1.4%) of seroconverters and 94\/534 (17.6%) of non-seroconverters tested. These participants were classified as failing ART; 88 (93.6%) of the non-seroconverters failing ART had resistance. Mutations used for surveillance of transmitted drug resistance were detected in 10.5% of seroconverters and 15.1% of non-seroconverters who were ARV naive.Two years after the start of HPTN 071 (2016-2017), 6259 participants were HIV positive and 1902 were viremic (viral load >400\u00a0copies\/ml). HIV genotyping and antiretroviral (ARV) drug testing were performed for viremic participants in three groups: seroconverters (infected 1 year, random subset) and participants with unknown duration of infection (random subset). A two-stage cluster-based approach was used to assess the impact of the study intervention on drug resistance. Treatment failure was defined as being viremic with ARV drugs detected. Participants were classified as ARV na\u00efve based on self-report and ARV drug testing.Universal HIV testing and treatment (UTT) has individual and public health benefits. HPTN 071 (PopART), a community-randomized trial in Zambia and South Africa, demonstrated that UTT decreased HIV incidence. This endpoint was assessed in a cohort of >48,000 randomly selected adults in the study communities. We evaluated the impact of UTT on HIV drug resistance in this cohort and compared other resistance-related outcomes in participants with recent versus non-recent HIV infection.","1375":"Effective public response to a pandemic relies upon accurate measurement of the extent and dynamics of an outbreak. Viral genome sequencing has emerged as a powerful approach to link seemingly unrelated cases, and large-scale sequencing surveillance can inform on critical epidemiological parameters. Here, we report the analysis of 236 SARS-CoV2 sequences from cases in the New York City metropolitan area during the initial stages of the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak. The majority of cases throughout the region had no recent travel history or known exposure, and genetically linked cases were spread throughout the region. Comparison to global viral sequences showed that the majority were most related to cases from Europe. Our data are consistent with numerous seed transmissions from multiple sources and a prolonged period of unrecognized community spreading. This work highlights the complementary role of real-time genomic surveillance in addition to traditional epidemiological indicators.","1376":" is the selective disadvantage of the transgene. Supplementation is also feasible in the transmissible vaccine case but is probably not practical to prevent the evolution of resistance against a gene drive. We note, however, that the continual replacement of even a small fraction of a large population can be challenging, limiting the usefulness of supplementation as a means of controlling unwanted evolution.","1377":"Influenza virus inflicts a heavy death toll annually and resistance to existing antiviral drugs has generated interest in the development of agents with novel mechanisms of action. Favipiravir is an antiviral drug that acts by increasing the genome-wide mutation rate of influenza A virus (IAV). Potential synergistic benefits of combining oseltamivir and favipiravir have been demonstrated in animal models of influenza, but the population-level effects of combining the drugs are unknown. In order to elucidate the underlying evolutionary processes at play, we performed genome-wide sequencing of IAV experimental populations subjected to serial passaging in vitro under a combined protocol of oseltamivir and favipiravir. We describe the interplay between mutation, selection, and genetic drift that ultimately culminates in population extinction. In particular, selective sweeps around oseltamivir resistance mutations reduce genome-wide variation while deleterious mutations hitchhike to fixation given the increased mutational load generated by favipiravir. This latter effect reduces viral fitness and accelerates extinction compared with IAV populations treated with favipiravir alone, but risks spreading both established and newly emerging mutations, including possible drug resistance mutations, if transmission occurs before the viral populations are eradicated.","1378":" < 0.001) on ocular temperature, with ocular temperature being greater following sham castration or castration.

The settings and activities at increased risk of infection indicate where efforts to reinforce individual and public health measures need to be concentrated.In this nationwide case-control study, cases were SARS-CoV-2 infected adults recruited between 23 May and 13 August 2021. Controls were non-infected adults from a national representative panel matched to cases by age, sex, region, population density and calendar week. Participants completed an online questionnaire and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and recent activity-related exposures, past history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and COVID-19 vaccination.We did not find any differences in the settings and activities associated with Delta versus non-Delta infections and grouped them for subsequent analyses. In multivariable analysis involving 12634 cases (8644 Delta and 3990 non-Delta) and 5560 controls, we found individuals under 40 years and attending bars (aOR:1.9; 95%CI:1.6-2.2) or parties (aOR:3.4; 95%CI:2.8-4.2) to be at increased risk of infection. In those aged 40 years and older, having children attend daycare (aOR:1.9; 95%CI:1.1-3.3), kindergarten (aOR:1.6; 95%CI:1.2-2.1), primary school (aOR:1.4; 95%CI:1.2-1.6) or middle school (aOR:1.3; 95%CI:1.2-1.6) were associated with increased risk of infection. We found strong protection against symptomatic Delta infection for those with prior infection whether it was recent (2-6 months) (95%; 95%CI:90-97) or associated with one dose (85%; 95%CI:78-90) or two doses of mRNA vaccine (96%; 95%CI:87-99).

Ethanol lock prophylaxis effectively reduces incidence of catheter-related infections. A recent policy decision has significantly increased the price of ethanol. In this study, we examine the cost-effectiveness of ethanol lock prophylaxis using a simulation model to compare the value to the current cost. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) lead to significant morbidity and mortality in children with intestinal failure (IF). Ethanol lock prophylaxis (ELP) greatly reduces CLABSI frequency with minimal side effects. However, in the United States, a recently approved orphan drug designation for dehydrated alcohol has greatly increased 70% ethanol cost from about $10\/day to $1000\/day. We examined the cost-effectiveness of ELP in relation to these changes.We simulated a previously developed IF Markov model over 1 year. Costs were measured in 2020 US dollars and effectiveness in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). CLABSI rate with and without ELP was estimated from the largest available comparative observational study. The primary outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between treatments. Secondary outcomes include CLABSI frequency. Sensitivity analyses on all model parameters were performed.At the current price, ELP is not cost-effective for CLABSI prevention in children with IF in the United States. This study highlights the critical need for the approval of an affordable lock therapy option to prevent CLABSIs in these children.In the base model, children with IF not using ELP accumulated $131,815 in costs and 0.32 QALYs per patient compared to $437,884 and 0.33 QALYs per patient in those using ELP. The ICER was nearly $18 million\/QALY gained. ELP resulted in a 40% reduction in CLABSI frequency. ELP became cost-effective at $68\/day and cost-saving at $63\/day. Sensitivity analysis identified no other plausible parameter variation to reach the $100,000\/QALY gained benchmark.","1381":"Meta-analysis is a powerful analytic method for summarizing effect estimates across studies. However, conventional meta-analysis often assumes a linear exposure-outcome relationship and does not account for variability over the exposure ranges. In this work, we first used simulation techniques to illustrate that the linear-based meta-analytical approach may result in oversimplistic effect estimation based on three plausible non-linear exposure-outcome curves (S-shape, inverted U-shape, and M-shape). We showed that subgroup meta-analysis that stratifies on exposure levels can investigate non-linearity and identify the consistency of effect magnitudes in these simulated examples. Next, we examined the heterogeneity of effect estimates across exposure ranges in two published linear-based meta-analyses of prenatal exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) on changes in mean birth weight or risk of preterm birth. The re-analysis found some varying effect sizes and potential heterogeneity when restricting to different PFAS exposure ranges, but findings were sensitive to the cut-off choices used to rank the exposure levels. Finally, we discussed methodological challenges and recommendations for detecting and interpreting potential non-linear associations in meta-analysis. Using meta-analysis without accounting for exposure range could contribute to literature inconsistency for exposure-induced health effects and impede evidence-based policymaking. Therefore, investigating result heterogeneity by exposure range is recommended.","1382":"We study how renewable energy impacts regional infrastructures considering the full deployment of electric mobility at that scale. We use the Sardinia Island in Italy as a paradigmatic case study of a semi-closed system both by energy and mobility point of view. Human mobility patterns are estimated by means of census data listing the mobility dynamics of about 700,000 vehicles, the energy demand is estimated by modeling the charging behavior of electric vehicle owners. Here we show that current renewable energy production of Sardinia is able to sustain the commuter mobility even in the theoretical case of a full switch from internal combustion vehicles to electric ones. Centrality measures from network theory on the reconstructed network of commuter trips allows to identify the most important areas (hubs) involved in regional mobility. The analysis of the expected energy flows reveals long-range effects on infrastructures outside metropolitan areas and points out that the most relevant unbalances are caused by spatial segregation between production and consumption areas. Finally, results suggest the adoption of planning actions supporting the installation of renewable energy plants in areas mostly involved by the commuting mobility, avoiding spatial segregation between consumption and generation areas.","1383":"Community First Responder (CFR) schemes are a long-established service supplementing ambulance trusts in their local community in the United Kingdom. CFRs are community members who volunteer to respond to people with life-threatening conditions. Previous studies highlighted the motivations for becoming CFRs, their training, community (un)awareness and implications of their work on themselves and others. The practices of CFRs in prehospital care remain underexplored. Therefore, we aimed to explore real-world practice of Community First Responders and their contribution to prehospital emergency care.We conducted 47 interviews with CFRs (21), CFR leads (15), ambulance clinicians (4), commissioners (2) and patients and relatives (5) from six ambulance services and regions of England, United Kingdom. Thematic analysis enabled identification of themes and subthemes, with subsequent interpretation built on the theory of practice wisdom.The sequential CFR practices supported ambulance services in delivering prehospital and emergency care in rural areas. CFR practices were founded on the principle of practice wisdom where CFRs constructed their practice decisions based on the patient's condition, their training, availability of equipment and medications and their scope of practice.Our analysis revealed the embeddedness of the concept of doing the right thing at the right time in CFR practice. CFRs' work consisted of a series of sequential and interconnected activities which included: identifying patients' signs, symptoms and problems; information sharing with the ambulance control room on the patient's condition; providing a rapid emergency response including assessment and care; and engaging with ambulance clinicians for patient transfer. The patient care sequence began with recognising patients' signs and symptoms, and validation of patient information provided by the ambulance control room. The CFRs shared patient information with ambulance control who in turn notified the ambulance crew en-route. The practices of CFRs also included delivery of emergency care before ambulance clinicians arrived. Following the delivery of a rapid emergency response, CFRs engaged with the ambulance crew to facilitate patient transfer to the nearest medical facility.","1384":"Households were randomised to one of four arms: advanced planning, leader recruitment, contingent group lotteries, or control.Pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial.Achieving high levels of household participation is crucial for many disease prevention efforts.

We develop a novel, unifying approach for analyzing GCC study data using the recently developed semiparametric extension of the generalized linear model (GLM), which is substantially more robust to model misspecification than existing approaches based on parametric GLMs. For valid estimation and inference, we use a conditional likelihood to account for the biased sampling design. We describe analysis procedures for estimation and inference for the semiparametric GLM under a conditional likelihood, and we discuss problems with estimation and inference under a conditional likelihood when the response distribution is misspecified. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach over existing ones through extensive simulation studies and we apply the methodology to an analysis of the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old study, which motives our research. The proposed approach yields a simple yet versatile solution for handling ODS in a wide variety of possible response distributions and sampling schemes encountered in\u00a0practice.

Over the 10-year period of its research programs, as SCORE operational research projects were implemented, their scope and scale posed important challenges in terms of research performance and the final interpretation of their results. The SCORE projects yielded valuable data on program-level effectiveness and strengths and weaknesses in performance, but in most of the trials, a greater-than-expected variation in community-level responses to assigned schedules of mass drug administration meant that identification of a dominant control strategy was not possible. This article critically reviews the impact of SCORE's cluster randomized study design on performance and interpretation of large-scale operational research such as ours.","1387":"The wastewater surveillance network successfully established for COVID-19 showed great potential to monitor other infectious viruses, such as norovirus, rotavirus and mpox virus. In this study, we established and validated detection methods for these viruses in wastewater. We developed a supernatant-based method to detect RNA viruses from wastewater samples and applied it to the monthly diarrhea viruses (norovirus genogroup I & II, and rotavirus) surveillance in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) at a city-wide level for 16 months. Significant correlations were observed between the diarrhea viruses concentrations in wastewater and detection rates in faecal specimens by clinical surveillance. The highest norovirus concentration in wastewater was obtained in winter, consistent with the seasonal pattern of norovirus outbreak in Hong Kong. Additionally, we established a pellet-based method to monitor DNA viruses in wastewater and detected weak signals for mpox virus in wastewater from a WWTP serving approximately 16,700 people, when the first mpox patient in Hong Kong was admitted to the hospital within the catchment area. Genomic sequencing provided confirmatory evidence for the validity of the results. Our findings emphasized the efficacy of the wastewater surveillance network in WWTPs as a cost-effective tool to track the transmission trend of diarrhea viruses and to provide sensitive detection of novel emerging viruses such as mpox virus in low-prevalence areas. The developed methods and surveillance results provide confidence for establishing robust wastewater surveillance programs to control infectious diseases in the post-pandemic era.","1388":"The cross replication observed in independent cohorts is evidence that DNA methylation in peripheral tissue can yield consistent and replicable PTSD associations, and our results also suggest that that some PTSD associations observed in peripheral tissue may mirror associations in the brain.In this study, we performed an EWAS of PTSD in a cohort of Veterans (n\u2009=\u2009378 lifetime PTSD cases and 135 controls) from the Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) cohort assessed using the Illumina EPIC Methylation BeadChip which assesses DNAm at more than 850,000 sites throughout the genome. Our model included covariates for ancestry, cell heterogeneity, sex, age, and a smoking score based on DNAm at 39 smoking-associated CpGs. We also examined in EPIC-based DNAm data generated from pre-frontal cortex (PFC) tissue from the National PTSD Brain Bank (n\u2009=\u200972).Previous studies using candidate gene and genome-wide approaches have identified epigenetic changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).The analysis of blood samples yielded one genome-wide significant association with PTSD at cg19534438 in the gene G0S2 (p\u2009=\u20091.19\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7, padj\u2009=\u20090.048). This association was replicated in an independent PGC-PTSD-EWAS consortium meta-analysis of military cohorts (p\u2009=\u20090.0024). We also observed association with the smoking-related locus cg05575921 in AHRR despite inclusion of a methylation-based smoking score covariate (p\u2009=\u20099.16\u2009\u00d7\u200910-6), which replicates a previously observed PGC-PTSD-EWAS association (Smith et al. 2019), and yields evidence consistent with a smoking-independent effect. The top 100 EWAS loci were then examined in the PFC data. One of the blood-based PTSD loci, cg04130728 in CHST11, which was in the top 10 loci in blood, but which was not genome-wide significant, was significantly associated with PTSD in brain tissue (in blood p\u2009=\u20091.19\u2009\u00d7\u200910-5, padj\u2009=\u20090.60, in brain, p\u2009=\u20090.00032 with the same direction of effect).

Our primary objective was to determine if county-level black-white segregation modified the association between maternal race\/ethnicity and adverse birth outcomes using birth records from the National Center for Health Statistics (2012). Based on maternal residence at birth, county-level black-white racial residential segregation was calculated along five dimensions of segregation: evenness, exposure, concentration, centralization, and clustering. We conducted a two-stage analysis: (1) county-specific logistic regression to determine whether maternal race and ethnicity were associated with preterm birth and term low birth weight; and (2) Bayesian meta-analyses to determine if segregation moderated these associations. We found greater black-white and Hispanic-white disparities in preterm birth in racially isolated counties (exposure) relative to non-isolated counties. We found reduced Hispanic-white disparities in term low birth weight in racially concentrated and centralized counties relative to non-segregated counties. Area-level poverty explained most of the moderating effect of segregation on disparities in adverse birth outcomes, suggesting that area-level poverty is a mediator of these associations. Segregation appears to modify racial\/ethnic disparities in adverse birth outcomes. Therefore, policy interventions that reduce black-white racial isolation, or buffer the poor social and economic correlates of segregation, may help to reduce disparities in preterm birth and term low birth weight.","1391":"Contaminants of emerging concerns such as endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) and pharmaceuticals\/personal-care products (PPCPs) constitute a problem since they are not completely eliminated by traditional water and wastewater treatment methods. Non-thermal plasma (NTP) is considered as one of the most favorable treatment methods for the removal of organic contaminants in water and wastewater. The degradation of selected EDCs and PPCPs of various classes was reviewed, based on the recent literature, to (i) address the effect of the main NTP treatment parameters (water quality and NTP conditions: pH, initial concentration, temperature, background common ion, NOM, scavenger, gas type\/flow rate, discharge\/reactor type, input power, and energy efficiency\/yield) on the degradation of contaminants and their intermediates, (ii) assess the influences of different catalysts and hybrid systems on degradation, (iii) describe EDC and PPCP degradation along with their properties, and (iv) evaluate mineralization, pathway, and degradation mechanism of selected EDCs and PPCPs for different cases studied. Furthermore, areas of potential research in NTP treatment for the degradation of EDCs and PPCPs in aqueous solutions are recommended. It could be reasonably predicted that this review is valid for developing our understanding of the fundamental scientific principles concerning the catalytic NTP of EDCs and PPCPs, providing helpful and practical references for researchers and designers on the effective removal of EDCs\/PPCPs and the optimized operation of catalytic NTP systems.","1392":"TGD AFAB individuals were willing to use and preferred self-sampling methods for cervicovaginal and anal HPV testing. Developing clinically approved self-sampling options for cancer screening could expand access to HPV screening for TGD AFAB populations.Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people assigned female at birth (AFAB) face numerous barriers to preventive care, including for HPV and cervical cancer screening. Self-sampling options may expand access to HPV testing for TGD people AFAB.The majority of the 101 participants who completed the study reported that the cervicovaginal self-swab was not uncomfortable (68.3%) and not difficult to use (86.1%), and nearly all (96.0%) were willing to use the swab in the future. Fewer participants found the anal swab to not be uncomfortable (47.5%), but most participants still found the anal swab to not be difficult to use (70.2%) and were willing to use the swab in the future (89.1%). Participants were more willing to use either swab if they had not seen a medical professional in the past year. About 70% of participants who reported negative experiences with either self-swab were still willing to use that swab in the future.We recruited TGD individuals AFAB to collect cervicovaginal and anal specimens at-home using self-sampling for HPV testing, and individuals reported their perceptions of self-sampling.

Here we consider how different types of control interventions impact the expected number of symptomatic infections due to outbreaks. Introduction of disease into the resident population from the community is modeled as a stochastic point process coupled to a branching process, while spread between residents is modeled via a deterministic compartmental model that accounts for depletion of susceptible individuals. Control is modeled as a proportional decrease in the number of susceptible residents, the reproduction number, and\/or the proportion of symptomatic infections. This permits a range of assumptions about the density dependence of transmission and modes of protection by vaccination, depopulation and other types of control. We find that vaccination or depopulation can have a greater than linear effect on the expected number of cases. For example, assuming a reproduction number of 3.0 with density-dependent transmission, we find that preemptively reducing the size of the susceptible population by 20% reduced overall disease burden by 47%. In some circumstances, it may be possible to reduce the risk and burden of disease outbreaks by optimizing the way a group of residents are apportioned into distinct residential units. The optimal apportionment may be different depending on whether the goal is to reduce the probability of an outbreak occurring, or the expected number of cases from outbreak dynamics. In other circumstances there may be an opportunity to implement reactive disease control measures in which the number of susceptible individuals is rapidly reduced once an outbreak has been detected to occur. Reactive control is most effective when the reproduction number is not too high, and there is minimal delay in implementing control. We highlight the California state prison system as an example for how these findings provide a quantitative framework for understanding disease transmission in congregate settings. Our approach and accompanying interactive website (https:\/\/phoebelu.shinyapps.io\/DepopulationModels\/) provides a quantitative framework to evaluate the potential impact of policy decisions governing infection control in outbreak settings.","1395":"We found evidence consistent with HIV and PrEP sorting among MSM, which may decrease the population-level effectiveness of PrEP. Bias analyses can improve mixing estimates for parameterization of transmission models.Population-level estimates of sexual network mixing for parameterizing prediction models of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) effectiveness are needed to inform prevention of HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM). Estimates obtained by egocentric sampling are vulnerable to information bias due to incomplete respondent knowledge.We estimated patterns of serosorting and PrEP sorting among MSM in the United States using data from a 2017-2019 egocentric sexual network study. Respondents served as proxies to report the HIV status and PrEP use of recent sexual partners. We contrasted results from a complete-case analysis (unknown HIV and PrEP excluded) versus a bias analysis with respondent-reported data stochastically reclassified to simulate unobserved self-reported data from sexual partners.We found strong evidence of preferential partnering across analytical approaches. The bias analysis showed concordance between sexual partners of HIV diagnosis and PrEP use statuses for MSM with diagnosed HIV (39%; 95% simulation interval: 31, 46), MSM who used PrEP (32%; 21, 37), and MSM who did not use PrEP (83%; 79, 87). The fraction of partners with diagnosed HIV was higher among MSM who used PrEP (11%; 9, 14) compared to MSM who did not use PrEP (4%; 3, 5). Comparatively, across all strata of respondents, the complete-case analysis overestimated the fractions of partners with diagnosed HIV or PrEP use.","1396":"Despite vaccination being one of the most effective public health interventions, there are persisting inequalities and inequities in immunisation.

We also evaluate how much this impact would improve under more equitable vaccination coverage scenarios. Using coverage data for MCV1 from 2000-2019, we estimate the number of deaths averted at the first administrative level. We use the ratio of deaths averted per vaccination from two mathematical models to extrapolate the impact at a subnational level. Next, we calculate inequality for each country, measuring the spread of deaths averted across its regions, accounting for differences in population. Finally, using three more equitable vaccination coverage scenarios, we evaluate how much impact of MCV1 immunisation could improve by (1) assuming all regions in a country have at least national coverage, (2) assuming all regions have the observed maximum coverage; and (3) assuming all regions have at least 80% coverage. Our results show that progress in coverage and reducing inequality has slowed in the last decade in many African countries. Under the three scenarios, a significant number of additional deaths in children could be prevented each year; for example, under the observed maximum coverage scenario, global MCV1 coverage would improve from 76% to 90%, resulting in a further 363(95%CrI:299-482) deaths averted per 100,000 live births. This paper illustrates that estimates of the impact of MCV1 immunisation at a national level can mask subnational heterogeneity. We further show that a considerable number of deaths could be prevented by maximising equitable access in countries with high inequality when increasing the global coverage of MCV1 vaccination.","1397":"Examine the potential for increased infection rates of T. cruzi in dogs following xenointoxication.In regions with high endemic disease prevalence in dogs and domestic vectors, prevalence of infected dogs initially increases but subsequently declines before eventually rising back to the initial equilibrium following one fluralaner treatment. In regions of low prevalence and domestic or sylvatic vectors, however, treatment seems to be detrimental. In these regions our models suggest a potential for a rise in dog prevalence, due to oral transmission from dead infected bugs.Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi , is transmitted via triatomine insect vectors. In Latin America, dogs are a common feeding source for triatomine vectors and subsequently an important reservoir of T. cruzi . One proposed intervention to reduce T. cruzi transmission is xenointoxication: treating dogs with oral insecticide to kill triatomine vectors in order to decrease overall T. cruzi transmission. Fluralaner, commonly administered to prevent ectoparasites such as fleas and ticks, is effective under laboratory conditions against the triatomine vectors. One concern with fluralaner treatment is that rapid death of the insect vectors may make the insects more available to oral ingestion by dogs; a more effective transmission pathway than stercorarian, the usual route for T. cruzi transmission. Using a mathematical model, we explored 3 different epidemiologic scenarios: high prevalence endemic disease within a domestic T. cruzi cycle, low prevalence endemic disease within a domestic T. cruzi cycle, and low prevalence endemic disease within a semi-sylvatic T. cruzi cycle. We found a range of beneficial to detrimental effects of fluralaner xenointoxication depending on the epidemiologic scenario. Our results suggest that careful field trials should be designed and carried out before wide scale implementation of fluralaner xenointoxication to reduce T. cruzi transmission.We built a deterministic mathematical model, based on the Ross-MacDonald malaria model, to investigate the net effect of fluralaner treatment on the prevalence of T. cruzi infection in dogs in different epidemiologic scenarios. We drew upon published data on the change in percentage of bugs killed that fed on treated dogs over days post treatment. Parameters were adjusted to mimic three scenarios of T. cruzi transmission: high and low disease prevalence and domestic vectors, and low disease prevalence and sylvatic vectors.Xenointoxication could be a beneficial and novel One Health intervention in regions with high prevalence of T. cruzi and domestic vectors. In regions with low prevalence and domestic or sylvatic vectors, there is potential harm. Field trials should be carefully designed to closely follow treated dogs and include early stopping rules if incidence among treated dogs exceeds that of controls.Chagas disease, a vector-borne parasitic disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi , affects millions in the Americas. Dogs are important reservoirs of the parasite. Under laboratory conditions, canine treatment with the systemic insecticide fluralaner demonstrated efficacy in killing Triatoma infestans and T. brasiliensis, T. cruzi vectors, when they feed on dogs. This form of pest control is called xenointoxication. However, T. cruzi can also be transmitted orally when mammals ingest infected bugs, so there is potential for dogs to become infected upon consuming infected bugs killed by the treatment. Xenointoxication thereby has two contrasting effects on dogs: decreasing the number of insects feeding on the dogs but increasing opportunities for exposure to T. cruzi via oral transmission to dogs ingesting infected insects.","1398":" < 0.001) in the incidence of malaria. In a historically high-malaria burden area of Uganda, a combination of LLINs, effective case management, IRS, and chemoprevention was associated with almost complete elimination of malaria in young children.","1399":"Routine therapeutic efficacy monitoring to measure the response to antimalarial treatment is a cornerstone of malaria control. To correctly measure drug efficacy, therapeutic efficacy studies require genotyping parasites from late treatment failures to differentiate between recrudescent infections and reinfections. However, there is a lack of statistical methods to systematically classify late treatment failures from genotyping data. A Bayesian algorithm was developed to estimate the posterior probability of late treatment failure being the result of a recrudescent infection from microsatellite genotyping data. The algorithm was implemented using a Monte Carlo Markov chain approach and was used to classify late treatment failures using published microsatellite data from therapeutic efficacy studies in Ethiopia and Angola. The algorithm classified 85% of the Ethiopian and 95% of the Angolan late treatment failures as either likely reinfection or likely recrudescence, defined as a posterior probability of recrudescence of 0.9, respectively. The adjusted efficacies calculated using the new algorithm differed from efficacies estimated using commonly used methods for differentiating recrudescence from reinfection. In a high-transmission setting such as Angola, as few as 15 samples needed to be genotyped in order to have enough power to correctly classify treatment failures. Analysis of microsatellite genotyping data for differentiating between recrudescence and reinfection benefits from an approach that both systematically classifies late treatment failures and estimates the uncertainty of these classifications. Researchers analyzing genotyping data from antimalarial therapeutic efficacy monitoring are urged to publish their raw genetic data and to estimate the uncertainty around their classification. ","1400":"The OCC strategy, therefore, presents improved operational and epidemiological outcomes relative to current practice and the other options considered.The OCC, PCC, and FCC strategies achieve campaign durations of 50, 51, and 52\u00a0days, respectively. Nine of the ten strategies can achieve a vaccination coverage of 80%, and OCC averts the most cases.Rapid outbreak response vaccination is a strategy for measles control and elimination. Measles vaccines must be stored and transported within a specified temperature range, but this can present significant challenges when targeting remote populations. Measles vaccine licensure for delivery outside cold chain (OCC) could provide more vaccine transport\/storage space without ice packs, and a solution to shorten response times. However, due to vaccine safety and wastage considerations, the OCC strategy will require other operational changes, potentially including the use of 1-dose (monodose) instead of 10-dose vials, requiring larger transport\/storage equipment currently achieved with 10-dose vials. These trade-offs require quantitative comparisons of vaccine delivery options to evaluate their relative benefits.We developed a modelling framework combining elements of the vaccine supply chain - cold chain, vial, team, and transport equipment types - with a measles transmission dynamics model to compare vaccine delivery options. We compared 10 strategies resulting from combinations of the vaccine supply elements and grouped into three main classes: OCC, partial cold chain (PCC), and full cold chain (FCC). For each strategy, we explored a campaign with 20 teams sequentially targeting 5 locations with 100,000 individuals each. We characterised the time needed to freeze ice packs and complete the campaign (campaign duration), vaccination coverage, and cases averted, assuming a fixed pre-deployment delay before campaign commencement. We performed sensitivity analyses of the pre-deployment delay, population sizes, and two team allocation schemes.","1401":"EDTA)-based chelation solution and twice daily oral, high-dose multivitamin and mineral supplements in patients with diabetes and a prior myocardial infarction (MI). TACT2 completed enrollment of 1000 subjects in December 2020, and infusions in December 2021. Subjects are being followed for 2.5 to 5 years. The primary endpoint is a composite of the time to first occurrence of all-cause mortality, MI, stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina. The trial is designed to have >85% power to detect a 30% relative reduction in the primary endpoint for each active treatment versus placebo comparison. TACT2 also includes a Trace Metals and Biorepository Core Lab, which will test the novel hypothesis that the prognostic benefits of chelation, if present, are due to removal of lead and cadmium from patients. Most of the design features of TACT2 were chosen to replicate selected features of the first TACT trial, which demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular outcomes in the EDTA chelation arm compared with placebo among patients with a prior MI, with the largest effect in patients with diabetes. Results from TACT2, if concordant with TACT, will provide definitive evidence of the benefit of edetate disodium-based chelation on cardiovascular outcomes, as well as the possible clinical importance of longitudinal changes in toxic metal levels of participants.","1402":"A fundamental challenge for personalized medicine is to capture enough of the complexity of an individual patient to determine an optimal way to keep them healthy or restore their health. This will require personalized computational models of sufficient resolution and with enough mechanistic information to provide actionable information to the clinician. Such personalized models are increasingly referred to as medical digital twins. Digital twin technology for health applications is still in its infancy, and extensive research and development is required. This article focuses on several projects in different stages of development that can lead to specific-and practical-medical digital twins or digital twin modeling platforms. It emerged from a two-day forum on problems related to medical digital twins, particularly those involving an immune system component. Open access video recordings of the forum discussions are available.","1403":"Oxidative stress is often involved in liver disease progression. Liver is the primary site for the synthesis of glutathione (GSH), the major intracellular antioxidant. GSH erythrocyte concentration can decrease in case of liver damage. So, the use of food supplements with antioxidant capacity has been reported in the veterinary literature. In this case-control study, we tested a new supplement containing S-acetyl-glutathione (SAG), silybin, and other antioxidant ingredients in dogs affected by liver disease. After two weeks of supplement administration, we were able to report a significant increase in the level of erythrocyte GSH in the treated (TRT) group, nearly reaching the physiological limit at the end of the study. In addition, most of the key liver parameters are significantly reduced in the TRT group by the end of the trial. The results of this study support the effectiveness of the tested complementary feed, which may be helpful in managing dogs with liver conditions.","1404":"The basic reproductive number --- $R_0$ --- is one of the most common and most commonly misapplied numbers in public health. Nevertheless, estimating $R_0$ for every transmissible pathogen, emerging or endemic, remains a priority for epidemiologists the world over. Although often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same $R_0$. Here, we show how predicting outbreak size requires both an estimate of $R_0$ and an estimate of the heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections. To facilitate rapid determination of outbreak risk, we propose a reformulation of a classic result from random network theory that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine the first moment ($R_0$) and the higher moments (representing the heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. Further, we show how this framework is robust in the face of the typically limited amount of data for emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging pathogens like 2019-nCoV, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically, in the case of 2019-nCoV from 5-40% of susceptible individuals. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond $R_0$ when predicting epidemic size.","1405":"There were significant improvements in access and turnaround times across US states; yet barriers to testing remained consistent across states underscoring the importance of a continued focus on testing, even amidst mass vaccination campaigns.In February 2021, across 10 US states, 11% (895) of respondents reported wanting a diagnostic test in the prior 2 weeks, 63% of whom got tested with limited variability across states. Almost all (97%) who got tested received their results; 56% received their results within 2 days. In MD, FL, and IL where serial data were available at four time points, 56% were tested the same day they wanted\/needed a test in February 2021 compared to 28% in July 2020, and 45% received results the same day as opposed to 17% in July 2020. Wanting a test was significantly more common among younger, non-white respondents and participants with a history of symptoms or exposure. Logistical challenges including not knowing where to go were the most frequently cited barriers.SARS-CoV-2 testing is critical for monitoring case counts, early detection and containment of infection, clinical management, and surveillance of variants. However, community-based data on the access, uptake, and barriers to testing have been lacking.We conducted serial cross-sectional online surveys covering demographics, COVID-19 symptoms, and experiences around SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing to characterize the SARS-CoV-2 testing cascade and associated barriers across 10 US states (California, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin), between July 2020 to February 2021.","1406":"Participatory surveillance (PS) has been defined as the bidirectional process of transmitting and receiving data for action by directly engaging the target population. Often represented as self-reported symptoms directly from the public, PS can provide evidence of an emerging disease or concentration of symptoms in certain areas, potentially identifying signs of an early outbreak. The construction of sets of symptoms to represent various disease syndromes provides a mechanism for the early detection of multiple health threats. Global Flu View (GFV) is the first-ever system that merges Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data from more than eight countries plus one region (Hong Kong) on four continents for global monitoring of this annual health threat. GFV provides a digital ecosystem for spatial and temporal visualization of syndromic aggregates compatible with ILI from the various systems currently participating in GFV in near real-time, updated weekly. In 2018, the first prototype of a digital platform to combine data from several ILI PS programs was created. At that time, the priority was to have a digital environment that brought together different programs through an Application Program Interface (API), providing a real-time map of syndromic trends that could demonstrate where and when ILI was spreading in various regions of the globe. After two years running as an experimental model and incorporating feedback from partner programs, GFV was restructured to empower the community of public health practitioners, data scientists and researchers by providing an open data channel among these contributors for sharing experiences across the network. GFV was redesigned to serve not only as a data hub but also as a dynamic knowledge network around participatory ILI surveillance by providing knowledge exchange among programs. Connectivity between existing PS systems enables a network of cooperation and collaboration with great potential for continuous public health impact. The exchange of knowledge within this network is not limited only to health professionals and researchers but also provides an opportunity for the general public to have an active voice in the collective construction of health settings. The focus on preparing the next generation of epidemiologists will be of great importance to scale innovative approaches like PS. GFV provides a useful example of the value of globally integrated PS data to help reduce the risks and damages of the next pandemic.","1407":"Among unvaccinated cohorts, the strategy that adds reflex HPV to triage mild cytology abnormality generated more life years saved than cytology-only screening and could be a cost-effective alternative. Among vaccinated cohorts, when vaccine uptake was 85% (based on the uptake in 2022), all guideline-based strategies (including the cytology-only screening) had ICERs above the WTP threshold when compared with no screening if the vaccine-induced protection duration was 20 years or longer. Under the same conditions, HPV testing with genotyping triage had ICERs (compared with no screening) below the WTP threshold if the routine screening interval was lengthened to 10 and 15 years or screening was initiated at ages 30 and 35 years.We considered the women population in Hong Kong which has a unique HPV infection and cervical cancer epidemiology compared to other regions in China and Asia. We used mathematical models which comprise a deterministic age-structured compartmental dynamic component and a stochastic individual-based cohort component to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening strategies for cervical screening. Following the recommendations in local guidelines in Hong Kong, we considered strategies that involved cytology, HPV testing, or co-testing as primary cervical screening. We also explored the impacts of adopting alternative de-intensified strategies for vaccinated cohorts. The 3-year cytology screening was used as the base comparator while no screening was also considered for vaccinated cohorts. Women's lifetime life years, quality-adjusted life years, and costs of screening and treatment were estimated from the societal perspective based on the year 2022 and were discounted by 3% annually. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were compared to a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of one gross domestic product per capita (US $47,792). Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted.Regarding primary and secondary cervical cancer prevention, the World Health Organization proposed the cervical cancer elimination strategy that requires countries to achieve 90% uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines and 70% screening uptake. The optimal cervical screening strategy is likely different for unvaccinated and vaccinated cohorts upon national HPV immunization. However, health authorities typically only provide a one-size-fits-all recommendation for the general population. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness for determining the optimal screening strategies for vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts.HPV testing is a cost-effective alternative to cytology for vaccinated cohorts, and the associated optimal screening frequency depends on vaccine uptake. Health authorities should optimize screening recommendations by accounting for population vaccine uptake.","1408":"Lineage-tracing methods have enabled characterization of clonal dynamics in complex populations, but generally lack the ability to integrate genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic measurements with live-cell manipulation of specific clones of interest. We developed a functionalized lineage-tracing system, ClonMapper, which integrates DNA barcoding with single-cell RNA sequencing and clonal isolation to comprehensively characterize thousands of clones within heterogeneous populations. Using ClonMapper, we identified subpopulations of a chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell line with distinct clonal compositions, transcriptional signatures and chemotherapy survivorship trajectories; patterns that were also observed in primary human chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The ability to retrieve specific clones before, during and after treatment enabled direct measurements of clonal diversification and durable subpopulation transcriptional signatures. ClonMapper is a powerful multifunctional approach to dissect the complex clonal dynamics of tumor progression and therapeutic response.","1409":" Insight into patterns regarding head and neck CTA ordering and nonroutine results may help optimize patient selection and radiologist communications in the ED setting.","1410":"This survey study compares features of self-reported symptoms of major depression in adults with or without a prior COVID-19 diagnosis.","1411":"In Wuhan, there were an estimated 1386 [95% CrI: 420-3793] symptomatic cases over 30 of COVID-19 between December 30, 2019 and January 12, 2020. In Seattle, we estimate that 2268 [95% CrI: 498, 6069] children under 18 and 4367 [95% CrI: 2776, 6526] adults were symptomatically infected between February 24 and March 9, 2020. We also find that the initial pandemic wave in Wuhan likely originated with a single infected case who developed symptoms sometime between October 26 and December 13, 2019; in Seattle, the seeding likely occurred between December 25, 2019 and January 15, 2020.Pandemic SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in Wuhan, China on December 31, 2019. Twenty-one days later, the US identified its first case--a man who had traveled from Wuhan to the state of Washington. Recent studies in the Wuhan and Seattle metropolitan areas retrospectively tested samples taken from patients with COVID-like symptoms. In the Wuhan study, there were 4 SARS-CoV-2 positives and 7 influenza positives out of 26 adults outpatients who sought care for influenza-like-illness at two central hospitals prior to January 12, 2020. The Seattle study reported 25 SARS-CoV-2 positives and 442 influenza positives out of 2353 children and adults who reported acute respiratory illness prior to March 9, 2020. Here, we use these findings to extrapolate the early prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19 in Wuhan and Seattle.The spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Seattle was far more extensive than initially reported. The virus likely spread for months in Wuhan before the lockdown. Given that COVID-19 appears to be overwhelmingly mild in children, our high estimate for symptomatic pediatric cases in Seattle suggests that there may have been thousands more mild cases at the time.For each city, we estimate the ratio of COVID-19 to influenza infections from the retrospective testing data and estimate the age-specific prevalence of influenza from surveillance reports during the same time period. Combining these, we approximate the total number of symptomatic COVID-19 infections.","1412":"Considerable spatial heterogeneity has been observed in COVID-19 transmission across administrative areas of England throughout the pandemic. This study investigates what drives these differences. We constructed a probabilistic case count model for 306 administrative areas of England across 95 weeks, fit using a Bayesian evidence synthesis framework. We incorporate the impact of acquired immunity, of spatial exportation of cases, and 16 spatially-varying socio-economic, socio-demographic, health, and mobility variables. Model comparison assesses the relative contributions of these respective mechanisms. We find that spatially-varying and time-varying differences in week-to-week transmission were definitively associated with differences in: time spent at home, variant-of-concern proportion, and adult social care funding. However, model comparison demonstrates that the impact of these terms is negligible compared to the role of spatial exportation between administrative areas. While these results confirm the impact of some, but not all, static measures of spatially-varying inequity in England, our work corroborates the finding that observed differences in disease transmission during the pandemic were predominantly driven by underlying epidemiological factors rather than aggregated metrics of demography and health inequity between areas. Further work is required to assess how health inequity more broadly contributes to these epidemiological factors.","1413":"Patterns of within-host influenza A virus (IAV) diversity and evolution have been described in natural human infections, but these patterns remain poorly characterized in non-human hosts. Elucidating these dynamics is important to better understand IAV biology and the evolutionary processes that govern spillover into humans. Here, we sampled an IAV outbreak in pigs during a week-long county fair to characterize viral diversity and evolution in this important reservoir host. Nasal wipes were collected on a daily basis from all pigs present at the fair, yielding up to 421 samples per day. Subtyping of PCR-positive samples revealed the co-circulation of H1N1 and H3N2 subtype swine IAVs. PCR-positive samples with robust Ct values were deep-sequenced, yielding 506 sequenced samples from a total of 253 pigs. Based on higher-depth re-sequenced data from a subset of these initially sequenced samples (260 samples from 168 pigs), we characterized patterns of within-host IAV genetic diversity and evolution. We find that IAV genetic diversity in single-subtype infected pigs is low, with the majority of intrahost Single Nucleotide Variants (iSNVs) present at frequencies of <10%. The ratio of the number of nonsynonymous to the number of synonymous iSNVs is significantly lower than under the neutral expectation, indicating that purifying selection shapes patterns of within-host viral diversity in swine. The dynamic turnover of iSNVs and their pronounced frequency changes further indicate that genetic drift also plays an important role in shaping IAV populations within pigs. Taken together, our results highlight similarities in patterns of IAV genetic diversity and evolution between humans and swine, including the role of stochastic processes in shaping within-host IAV dynamics.","1414":"Our study suggests that AA patients have a significantly higher risk of prolonged LOS after elective ACDF for CSM compared with C patients.A total of 15,400 patients were identified, of whom 13,250 (86.0%) were Caucasian (C) and 2150 (14.0%) were African American (AA). The C cohort tended to be older, whereas the AA cohort had 2 times as many patients in the 0-25th income quartile. The prevalence of comorbidities was greater in the AA cohort. Intraoperative fusion levels were similar between the cohorts, whereas the AA cohort had a higher rate of cerebrospinal fluid leak\/dural tear. In relation to the number of complications, the C cohort had a lower rate compared with the AA cohort (P\u00a0= 0.006), including no complication (89.4% vs. 85.3%), 1 complication (9.9% vs. 12.8%), and >1 complication (0.7% vs. 1.9%). The AA cohort experienced significantly longer hospital stays (C, 1.9 \u00b1 2.3 days vs. AA, 2.7 \u00b1 3.5; P < 0.001), greater proportion of extended LOS (C, 17.5% vs. AA, 29.1%; P < 0.001) and nonroutine discharges (C, 16.1% vs. AA, 28.6%; P < 0.001). AA race was a significant independent risk factor for extended LOS (odds ratio, 1.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.50-2.61; P < 0.001).A retrospective cohort study was performed using the National Inpatient Sample database from 2016 to 2017. All adult patients undergoing ACDF for CSM were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification coding system.The aim of this study was to investigate whether race is an independent predictor of extended length of stay (LOS) after elective anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).","1415":"The measles virus is among the most transmissible viruses known to infect humans. Prior to measles vaccination programs, measles infected over 95% of all children and was responsible for over 4 million deaths each year. Measles vaccination programs have been among the greatest public health achievements reducing, eliminating endemic measles in the whole of the Americas and across much of the globe. Where measles vaccines are introduced, unexpectedly large reductions in all-cause childhood mortality have been observed. These gains appear to derive in part from direct heterologous benefits of measles vaccines that enhance innate and adaptive immune responses. Additionally, by preventing measles infections, vaccination prevents measles-associated short- and long-term immunomodulating effects. Before vaccination, these invisible hallmarks of measles infections increased vulnerability to non-measles infections in nearly all children for weeks, months, or years following acute infections. By depleting measles incidence, vaccination has had important indirect benefits to reduce non-measles mortality. Delineating the relative importance of these two modes of survival benefits following measles vaccine introduction is of critical public health importance. While both support continued unwavering global commitments to measles vaccination programs until measles eradication is complete, direct heterologous benefits of measles vaccination further support continued commitment to measles vaccination programs indefinitely. We discuss what is known about direct and indirect nonspecific measles vaccine benefits, and their implications for continued measles vaccination programs.","1416":"The growth of antimicrobial resistance presents a significant threat to human and animal health. Of particular concern is multi-drug resistance, as this increases the chances an infection will be untreatable by any antibiotic. In order to understand multi-drug resistance, it is essential to understand the association between drug resistances. Pairwise associations characterize the connectivity between resistances and are useful in making decisions about courses of treatment, or the design of drug cocktails. Higher-order associations, interactions, which tie together groups of drugs can suggest commonalities in resistance mechanism and lead to their identification. To capture interactions, we apply log-linear models of contingency tables to analyze publically available data on the resistance of Escheresia coli isolated from chicken and turkey meat by the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System. Standard large sample and conditional exact testing approaches for assessing significance of parameters in these models breakdown due to structured patterns inherent to antimicrobial resistance. To address this, we adopt a Bayesian approach which reveals that E. coli resistance associations can be broken into two subnetworks. The first subnetwork is characterized by a hierarchy of \u03b2-lactams which is consistent across the chicken and turkey datasets. Tier one in this hierarchy is a near equivalency between amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone and cefoxitin. Susceptibility to tier one then implies susceptibility to ceftiofur. The second subnetwork is characterized by more complex interactions between a variety of drug classes that vary between the chicken and turkey datasets.","1417":"While most aspects of virus dynamics are well understood in standard models, the phenomenon of multiple infection (or coinfection) can change the properties of the dynamics, and this has so far not been fully explored. An important parameter in determining the properties of the model is the virus output from multiply infected cells compared to that from singly infected cells. If the amount of virus produced by infected cells during their life-span is independent of the infection multiplicity, then multiple infection does not change the dynamics. If, however, multiply infected cells produce more virus during their life-span than singly infected cells, then the properties of the dynamics can change fundamentally. This paper presents a detailed mathematical analysis of this scenario. We demonstrate that under some realistic conditions, the equilibrium structure of the solutions acquires novel properties. In particular, infection can persist even for values of the basic reproductive number, R0, smaller than unity. In this regime, we observe the phenomenon of bistability, when two stable equilibria are present simultaneously, and the outcome is determined by the initial conditions. The two possible solutions are the virus-free equilibrium, which is exactly the same as the one observed in the absence of multiple infection, and a novel infection equilibrium. In the presence of this outcome, it is clear that the meaning of the parameter R0 changes, as it no longer simply indicates the possibility of successful infection. This adds to our understanding and interpretation of R0 in virus dynamics models, and also provides further insights about conditions that can lead to virus extinction rather than persistence. It turns out that conditions for bistability depend (in a fully specified way) on the model structure, particularly on the way the infection term is formulated. We provide a general condition that informs us whether or not bistability occurs, and define what needs to be measured when examining the dynamics of multiple infection in specific biological systems. ","1418":"Appropriate isolation guidelines for COVID-19 patients are warranted. Currently, isolating for fixed time is adapted in most countries. However, given the variability in viral dynamics between patients, some patients may no longer be infectious by the end of isolation (thus they are redundantly isolated), whereas others may still be infectious. Utilizing viral test results to determine ending isolation would minimize both the risk of ending isolation of infectious patients and the burden due to redundant isolation of noninfectious patients. In our previous study, we proposed a computational framework using SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics models to compute the risk and the burden of different isolation guidelines with PCR tests. In this study, we extend the computational framework to design isolation guidelines for COVID-19 patients utilizing rapid antigen tests. Time interval of tests and number of consecutive negative tests to minimize the risk and the burden of isolation were explored. Furthermore, the approach was extended for asymptomatic cases. We found the guideline should be designed considering various factors: the infectiousness threshold values, the detection limit of antigen tests, symptom presence, and an acceptable level of releasing infectious patients. Especially, when detection limit is higher than the infectiousness threshold values, more consecutive negative results are needed to ascertain loss of infectiousness. To control the risk of releasing of infectious individuals under certain levels, rapid antigen tests should be designed to have lower detection limits than infectiousness threshold values to minimize the length of prolonged isolation, and the length of prolonged isolation increases when the detection limit is higher than the infectiousness threshold values, even though the guidelines are optimized for given conditions.","1419":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389\/fnagi.2021.735524.].","1420":"Prior to updating global influenza-associated mortality estimates, the World Health Organization convened a consultation in July 2017 to understand differences in methodology and implications on results of three influenza mortality projects from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Netherlands Institute for Health Service Research (GLaMOR), and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). The expert panel reviewed estimates and discussed differences in data sources, analysis, and modeling assumptions. We performed a comparison analysis of the estimates. Influenza-associated respiratory death counts were comparable between CDC and GLaMOR; IHME estimate was considerably lower. The greatest country-specific influenza-associated mortality rate fold differences between CDC\/IHME and between GLaMOR\/IHME estimates were among countries in South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean region. The data envelope used for the calculation was one of the major differences (CDC and GLaMOR: all respiratory deaths; IHME: low respiratory infection deaths). With the assumption that there is only one cause of death for each death, IHME estimates a fraction of the full influenza-associated respiratory mortality that is measured by the other two groups. Wide variability of parameters was observed. Continued coordination between groups could assist with better understanding of methodological differences and new approaches to estimating influenza deaths globally.","1421":"Overall, our work emphasizes the utility of applying biomedical tools, like PhIP-Seq, first developed for humans to viral surveillance efforts in wildlife, while highlighting opportunities for taxon-specific improvements.Here, for the first time, we apply PhIP-Seq technology to bat serum, using a viral peptide library originally designed to simultaneously assay exposures to the entire human virome.Bats are important providers of ecosystem services such as pollination, seed dispersal, and insect control but also act as natural reservoirs for virulent zoonotic viruses. Bats host multiple viruses that cause life-threatening pathology in other animals and humans but, themselves, experience limited pathological disease from infection. Despite bats' importance as reservoirs for several zoonotic viruses, we know little about the broader viral diversity that they host. Bat virus surveillance efforts are challenged by difficulties of field capture and the limited scope of targeted PCR- or ELISA-based molecular and serological detection. Additionally, virus shedding is often transient, thus also limiting insights gained from nucleic acid testing of field specimens. Phage ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq), a broad serological tool used previously to comprehensively profile viral exposure history in humans, offers an exciting prospect for viral surveillance efforts in wildlife, including bats.Using VirScan, we identified past exposures to 57 viral genera-including betacoronaviruses, henipaviruses, lyssaviruses, and filoviruses-in semi-captive Pteropus alecto and to nine viral genera in captive Eonycteris spelaea. Consistent with results from humans, we find that both total peptide hits (the number of enriched viral peptides in our library) and the corresponding number of inferred past virus exposures in bat hosts were correlated with poor bat body condition scores and increased with age. High and low body condition scores were associated with either seropositive or seronegative status for different viruses, though in general, virus-specific age-seroprevalence curves defied assumptions of lifelong immunizing infection, suggesting that many bat viruses may circulate via complex transmission dynamics.","1422":"Community surveillance surveys offer an opportunity to obtain important and timely public health information that may help local municipalities guide their response to public health threats. The objective of this paper is to present approaches, challenges, and solutions from SARS-CoV-2 surveillance surveys conducted in different settings by 2 research teams. For rapid assessment of a representative sample, a 2-stage cluster sampling design was developed by an interdisciplinary team of researchers at Oregon State University between April 2020 and June 2021 across 6 Oregon communities. In 2022, these methods were adapted for New York communities by a team of veterinary, medical, and public health practitioners. Partnerships were established with local medical facilities, health departments, COVID-19 testing sites, and health and public safety staff. Field staff were trained using online modules, field manuals describing survey methods and safety protocols, and in-person meetings with hands-on practice. Private and secure data integration systems and public awareness campaigns were implemented. Pilot surveys and field previews revealed challenges in survey processes that could be addressed before surveys proceeded. Strong leadership, robust trainings, and university-community partnerships proved critical to successful outcomes. Cultivating mutual trust and cooperation among stakeholders is essential to prepare for the next pandemic.","1423":"Previous studies of human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) morphology found spatial differences in density: a high density of cells in the macula, decreasing peripherally. Because the RPE sheet is not perfectly regular, we anticipate that there will be differences between conditions and when and where damage is most likely to begin. The purpose of this study is to establish relationships among RPE morphometrics in age, cell location, and disease of normal human and AMD eyes that highlight irregularities reflecting damage. Cadaveric eyes from 11 normal and 3 age-related macular degeneration (AMD) human donors ranging from 29 to 82 years of age were used. Borders of RPE cells were identified with phalloidin. RPE segmentation and analysis were conducted with CellProfiler. Exploration of spatial point patterns was conducted using the \"spatstat\" package of R. In the normal human eye, with increasing age, cell size increased, and cells lost their regular hexagonal shape. Cell density was higher in the macula versus periphery. AMD resulted in greater variability in size and shape of the RPE cell. Spatial point analysis revealed an ordered distribution of cells in normal and high spatial disorder in AMD eyes. Morphometrics of the RPE cell readily discriminate among young vs. old and normal vs. diseased in the human eye. The normal RPE sheet is organized in a regular array of cells, but AMD exhibited strong spatial irregularity. These findings reflect on the robust recovery of the RPE sheet after wounding and the circumstances under which it cannot recover. ","1424":"A growing body of research is focused on the extinction of parasite species in response to host endangerment and declines. Beyond the loss of parasite species richness, host extinction can impact apparent parasite host specificity, as measured by host richness or the phylogenetic distances among hosts. Such impacts on the distribution of parasites across the host phylogeny can have knock-on effects that may reshape the adaptation of both hosts and parasites, ultimately shifting the evolutionary landscape underlying the potential for emergence and the evolution of virulence across hosts. Here, we examine how the reshaping of host phylogenies through extinction may impact the host specificity of parasites, and offer examples from historical extinctions, present-day endangerment, and future projections of biodiversity loss. We suggest that an improved understanding of the impact of host extinction on contemporary host-parasite interactions may shed light on core aspects of disease ecology, including comparative studies of host specificity, virulence evolution in multi-host parasite systems, and future trajectories for host and parasite biodiversity.

Including HCW and FW in the preventive vaccination campaign yielded\u00a0\u223c14\u00a0% to\u00a0\u223c38\u00a0% improvements in epidemic outcomes. Further including the GP yielded the greatest improvements, with\u00a0\u223c21\u00a0% to\u00a0\u223c52\u00a0% reductions in epidemic outcomes compared with NPI + ring vaccination alone. In a scenario without ring vaccination, preventive vaccination reduced cases, hospitalizations, and deaths by\u00a0\u223c28\u00a0% to\u00a0\u223c59\u00a0% compared with NPI alone. In all scenarios, preventive vaccination reduced Ebola transmission particularly during the initial phases of the epidemic, resulting in flatter epidemic curves.The IBM showed that preventive vaccination may reduce Ebola cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, thus safeguarding the healthcare system and providing more time to implement additional interventions during an outbreak.Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) and ring vaccination (i.e., vaccination that primarily targets contacts and contacts of contacts of Ebola cases) are currently used to reduce the spread of Ebola during outbreaks. Because these measures are typically initiated after an outbreak is declared, they are limited by real-time implementation challenges. Preventive vaccination may provide a complementary option to help protect communities against unpredictable outbreaks. This study aimed to assess the impact of preventive vaccination strategies when implemented in conjunction with NPI and ring vaccination.A spatial-explicit, individual-based model (IBM) that accounts for heterogeneity of human contact, human movement, and timing of interventions was built to represent Ebola transmission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Simulated preventive vaccination strategies targeted healthcare workers (HCW), frontline workers (FW), and the general population (GP) with varying levels of coverage (lower coverage: 30% of HCW\/FW, 5% of GP; higher coverage: 60% of HCW\/FW, 10% of GP) and efficacy (lower efficacy: 60%; higher efficacy: 90%).","1426":"The mixture cure model for analyzing survival data is characterized by the assumption that the population under study is divided into a group of subjects who will experience the event of interest over some finite time horizon and another group of cured subjects who will never experience the event irrespective of the duration of follow-up. When using the Bayesian paradigm for inference in survival models with a cure fraction, it is common practice to rely on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to sample from posterior distributions. Although computationally feasible, the iterative nature of MCMC often implies long sampling times to explore the target space with chains that may suffer from slow convergence and poor mixing. Furthermore, extra efforts have to be invested in diagnostic checks to monitor the reliability of the generated posterior samples. A sampling-free strategy for fast and flexible Bayesian inference in the mixture cure model is suggested in this article by combining Laplace approximations and penalized B-splines. A logistic regression model is assumed for the cure proportion and a Cox proportional hazards model with a P-spline approximated baseline hazard is used to specify the conditional survival function of susceptible subjects. Laplace approximations to the posterior conditional latent vector are based on analytical formulas for the gradient and Hessian of the log-likelihood, resulting in a substantial speed-up in approximating posterior distributions. The spline specification yields smooth estimates of survival curves and functions of latent variables together with their associated credible interval are estimated in seconds. A fully stochastic algorithm based on a Metropolis-Langevin-within-Gibbs sampler is also suggested as an alternative to the proposed Laplacian-P-splines mixture cure (LPSMC) methodology. The statistical performance and computational efficiency of LPSMC is assessed in a simulation study. Results show that LPSMC is an appealing alternative to MCMC for approximate Bayesian inference in standard mixture cure models. Finally, the novel LPSMC approach is illustrated on three applications involving real survival data.","1427":" = 0.007 and 0.011, respectively). The association between MEPB and ASD compared to the controls was similar between the externally matched SS pairs and the original frequency matched cohort.

Combining the transmission model, patient-to-patient contact networks, and sparse observations of colonization, we develop and validate an individual-level inference approach that estimates the colonization probability of individual hospitalized patients. For both model-simulated and historical outbreaks, the proposed method supports the more accurate identification of asymptomatic MRSA carriers than other traditional approaches. In addition, in silica control experiments indicate that interventions targeted to inpatients with a high-colonization probability outperform heuristic strategies informed by hospitalization history and contact tracing.","1429":"In this work, we retrospectively validate the use of a nowcasting algorithm during 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy by quantitatively assessing its performance against standard methods for the estimation of R.The time-varying reproduction number R is a critical variable for situational awareness during infectious disease outbreaks; however, delays between infection and reporting of cases hinder its accurate estimation in real-time. A number of nowcasting methods, leveraging available information on data consolidation delays, have been proposed to mitigate this problem.Nowcasting significantly reduced the median lag in the estimation of R from 13 to 8 days, while concurrently enhancing accuracy. Furthermore, it allowed the detection of periods of epidemic growth with a lead of between 6 and 23 days.Nowcasting augments epidemic awareness, empowering better informed public health responses.","1430":"We quantified the spatial and temporal entropy related to football teams and their players by means of a pass-based interaction. First, we calculated the spatial entropy associated to the positions of all passes made by a football team during a match, obtaining a spatial entropy ranking of Spanish teams during the 2017\/2018 season. Second, we investigated how the player\u0092s average location in the field is related to the amount of entropy of his passes. Next, we constructed the temporal passing networks of each team and computed the deviation of their network parameters along the match. For each network parameter, we obtained the permutation entropy and the statistical complexity of its temporal fluctuations. Finally, we investigated how the permutation entropy (and statistical complexity) of the network parameters was related to the total number of passes made by a football team. Our results show that (i) spatial entropy changes according to the position of players in the field, and (ii) the organization of passing networks change during a match and its evolution can be captured measuring the permutation entropy and statistical complexity of the network parameters, allowing to identify what parameters evolve more randomly.

However, phenotypic plasticity and phenotype-dependent habitat choice are additional mechanisms that could also drive adaptation across spatially variable environments. We present evidence for apparently adaptive phenotypic variation across surprisingly small spatial scales (<2 vertical meters) in the threespine stickleback. We find that male breeding coloration varies as a function of the lakes\u0092 optical-depth gradient, and these small-scale clines (\u0091microclines\u0092) appear to be an adaptive response to ambient light gradients, as male color changes predictably in the opposite direction (\u0091countergradient\u0092) to ambient light spectral shifts. Using visual models and field enclosure experiments, we show that these microclines result from phenotypic plasticity that maintains male conspicuousness. Our results show that adaptive phenotypic clines can exist across small spatial scales, because phenotypic plasticity rapidly generates repeatable trait-environment correlations despite the overwhelming opportunity for gene flow. Furthermore, these results provide strong evidence that phenotypic plasticity in nuptial coloration is an important mechanism for adjusting the conspicuousness of a visual signal to conspecifics.","1432":"Background The COVID-19 epidemic originated in Wuhan City of Hubei Province in December 2019 and has spread throughout China. Understanding the fast evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy. Methods We collected individual information on 8,579 laboratory-confirmed cases from official publically sources reported outside Hubei in mainland China, as of February 17, 2020. We estimated the temporal variation of the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt) at the provincial level. Results The median age of the cases was 44 years, with an increasing of cases in younger age groups and the elderly as the epidemic progressed. The delay from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4.4 days (95%CI: 0.0-14.0) until January 27 to 2.6 days (0.0-9.0) from January 28 to February 17. The mean incubation period was estimated at 5.2 days (1.8-12.4) and the mean serial interval at 5.1 days (1.3-11.6). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei was highly variable, but consistently included a mix of case importations and local transmission. We estimate that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than three weeks with Rt reaching peaks between 1.40 (1.04-1.85) in Shenzhen City of Guangdong Province and 2.17 (1.69-2.76) in Shandong Province. In all the analyzed locations (n=10) Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold since the end of January. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the strict containment measures and movement restrictions in place may contribute to the interruption of local COVID-19 transmission outside Hubei Province. The shorter serial interval estimated here implies that transmissibility is not as high as initial estimates suggested. ### Competing Interest Statement B.J.C. has received honoraria from Roche and Sanofi Pasteur.

However, estimates of their impact on transmissibility remain limited. Here, we evaluated the impact of isolation and vaccination (7 days after the 2nd dose) on SARS-CoV-2 transmission within Israeli households. From December 2020 to April 2021, confirmed cases were identified among healthcare workers of the Sheba Medical Centre and their family members. Recruited households were followed up with repeated PCR for at least ten days after case confirmation. Data were analyzed using a data augmentation Bayesian framework. 210 households with 215 index cases were enrolled. 269 out of 667 (40%) susceptible household contacts developed a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of those, 170 (63%) developed symptoms. Compared with unvaccinated and unisolated adult\/teenager contacts, vaccination reduced the risk of infection among unisolated adult\/teenager contacts above 12 (RR=0.21, 95% CrI credible interval 0.08-0.44) and isolation reduced the risk of infection among unvaccinated adult\/teenager (RR=0.12, 95% CrI 0.06-0.21) and child contacts (RR=0.17, 95% CrI 0.08-0.32). Infectivity was reduced in vaccinated cases (RR=0.25, 95% CrI 0.06-0.77). Within households, vaccination reduces both the risk of infection and of transmission if infected. When contacts were unvaccinated, isolation also led to important reductions in the risk of transmission.","1434":"Three different mosquito populations were used: Ae. aegypti infected with Wolbachia (wMelBr strain), wild Ae. aegypti and wild Ae. albopictus. A total of 21 treatments explored intra and interspecific larval competition with varying larval densities, species proportions and food levels. Each treatment had eight replicates with two distinct food levels: 0.25 or 0.50 g of Chitosan and fallen avocado leaves. Overall, overcrowding reduced fitness correlates of the three populations. Ae. albopictus larvae presented lower larval mortality, shorter development time to adult and smaller wing sizes than Ae. aegypti. The presence of Wolbachia had a slight positive effect on larval biology, since infected individuals had higher survivorship than uninfected Ae. aegypti larvae.In all treatments, Ae. albopictus outperformed both wild Ae. aegypti and the Wolbachia-infected group in larval competition, irrespective of larval density and the amount of food resources. The major force that can slow down Wolbachia invasion is the population density of wild mosquitoes. Given that Ae. aegypti currently dominates in Rio, in comparison with Ae. albopictus frequency, additional attention must be given to the population density of Ae. aegypti during releases to increase the likelihood of Wolbachia invasion.Wolbachia has been deployed in several countries to reduce transmission of dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses. During releases, Wolbachia-infected females are likely to lay their eggs in local available breeding sites, which might already be colonized by local Aedes sp. mosquitoes. Therefore, there is an urgent need to estimate the deleterious effects of intra and interspecific larval competition on mosquito life history traits, especially on the duration of larval development time, larval mortality and adult size.","1435":"The immense global diversity of HIV-1 is a significant obstacle to developing a safe and effective vaccine. We recently showed that infections established with multiple founder variants are associated with the development of neutralization breadth years later. We propose a novel vaccine design strategy that integrates the variability observed in acute HIV-1 infections with multiple founder variants. We developed a probabilistic model to simulate this variability, yielding a set of sequences that present the minimal diversity seen in an infection with multiple founders. We applied this model to a subtype C consensus sequence for the Envelope (Env) (used as input) and showed that the simulated Env sequences mimic the mutational landscape of an infection with multiple founder variants, including diversity at antibody epitopes. The derived set of multi-founder-variant-like, minimally distant antigens is designed to be used as a vaccine cocktail specific to a HIV-1 subtype or circulating recombinant form and is expected to promote the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies.","1436":" phenotype, epitope targeting, and durability.

In the absence of an expanded routine program, SIAs provide a powerful option for providing this second dose. We show that a single high coverage SIA can deliver most key benefits in terms of maintaining elimination, with follow-up campaigns potentially requiring smaller investments. This makes post-campaign evaluation of coverage increasingly relevant to correctly assess future outbreak risk.All six WHO regions currently have goals for measles elimination by 2020. Measles vaccination is delivered via routine immunization programmes, which in most sub-Saharan African countries reach children around 9months of age, and supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), which target a wider age range at multi-annual intervals. In the absence of endemic measles circulation, the proportion of individuals susceptible to measles will gradually increase through accumulation of new unvaccinated individuals in each birth cohort, increasing the risk of an epidemic. The impact of SIAs and the financial investment they require, depend on coverage and target age range.We found that a single SIA can maintain elimination over short time-scales, even with low routine coverage. However, maintaining elimination for more than a few years is difficult, even with large (high coverage\/wide age range) recurrent SIAs, due to the build-up of susceptible individuals. Across the demographic and vaccination contexts investigated, expanding SIAs to target individuals over 10years did not significantly reduce outbreak risk.","1438":"Biennial DBT screening for all simulated women started at age 50 vs 40 years averted 7.4 vs 8.5 breast cancer deaths, respectively, and led to 884 vs 1392 false-positive recalls and 151 vs 221 false-positive biopsy recommendations, respectively. Biennial digital mammography had similar deaths averted and slightly more false-positive test results than DBT screening. Adding MRI for women with extremely dense breasts to biennial DBT screening for women aged 50 to 74 years increased deaths averted (7.6 vs 7.4), false-positive recalls (919 vs 884), and false-positive biopsy recommendations (180 vs 151). Extending supplemental MRI to women with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts further increased deaths averted (8.0 vs 7.4), false-positive recalls (1088 vs 884), and false-positive biopsy recommendations (343 vs 151). The same strategy for women aged 40 to 74 years averted 9.5 deaths but led to 1850 false-positive recalls and 628 false-positive biopsy recommendations. Annual screening modestly increased estimated deaths averted but markedly increased estimated false-positive results.Annual or biennial mammography screening with or without supplemental MRI by breast density starting at ages 40, 45, or 50 years through age 74 years.Information on long-term benefits and harms of screening with digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) with or without supplemental breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is needed for clinical and policy discussions, particularly for patients with dense breasts.In this model-based comparative effectiveness analysis, supplemental MRI for women with dense breasts added to DBT screening led to greater benefits and increased harms. The balance of this trade-off for supplemental MRI use was more favorable when MRI was targeted to women with extremely dense breasts who comprise approximately 10% of the population.To project long-term population-based outcomes for breast cancer mammography screening strategies (DBT or digital mammography) with or without supplemental MRI by breast density.Collaborative modeling using 3 Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) breast cancer simulation models informed by US Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium data.

There is reason to suspect that this is an underestimate of the true burden, since LD cases may be underdiagnosed. In this analysis of pneumonia and influenza (P&I) hospitalizations, we estimated the percentages of cases due to Legionella, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) by age group. We fitted mixed-effects models to estimate attributable percents using weekly time series data on P&I hospitalizations in Connecticut from 2000 to 2014. Model-fitted values were used to calculate estimates of numbers of P&I hospitalizations attributable to Legionella (and influenza and RSV) by age group, season, and year. Our models estimated that 1.9%, 8.8%, and 5.1% of total (all-ages) inpatient P&I hospitalizations could be attributed to Legionella, influenza, and RSV, respectively. Only 10.6% of total predicted LD cases had been clinically diagnosed as LD during the study period. The observed incidence rate of 1.2 cases per 100,000 population was substantially lower than our estimated rate of 11.6 cases per 100,000 population. Our estimates of numbers of P&I hospitalizations attributable to Legionella are comparable to those provided by etiological studies of community-acquired pneumonia and emphasize the potential for underdiagnosis of LD in clinical settings.","1440":"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), one of the most prevalent viruses across the globe, is a common cause of morbidity and mortality for immunocompromised individuals. Recent clinical observations have demonstrated that mixed strain infections are common and may lead to more severe disease progression. This clinical observation illustrates the complexity of the HCMV genome and emphasizes the importance of taking a population-level view of genotypic evolution. Here we review frequently sampled polymorphisms in the glycoproteins of HCMV, comparing the variable regions, and summarizing their corresponding geographic distributions observed to date. The related strain-specific immunity, including neutralization activity and antigen-specific cellular immunity, is also discussed. Given that these glycoproteins are common targets for vaccine design and anti-viral therapies, this observed genetic variation represents an important resource for future efforts to combat HCMV infections.","1441":"In recent years, the study of circadian rhythms in mammals has flourished. Animal models revealed that all body tissues have circadian rhythms. In humans, circadian rhythms were also shown to exist at multiple levels of organization: molecular, cellular, and physiological processes, including responding to oxidative stress, cell trafficking, and sex hormone production, respectively. Together, these rhythms are an essential component of human physiology and can shape an individual's susceptibility and response to disease. Circadian rhythms are relatively unexplored in environmental health research. However, circadian clocks control many physiological and behavioral processes that impact exposure pathways and disease systems. We believe this review will motivate new studies of (i) the impact of exposures on circadian rhythms, (ii) how circadian rhythms modify the effect of environmental exposures, and (iii) how time-of-day impacts our ability to observe the body's response to exposure.This review aims to explore how circadian rhythms influence disease susceptibility and potentially modify the effect of environmental exposures. We aimed to identify biomarkers commonly used in environmental health research that have also been the subject of chronobiology studies, in order to review circadian rhythms of relevance to environmental health and determine if time-of-day is an important factor to consider in environmental health studies. Moreover, we discuss opportunities for studying how environmental exposures may interact with circadian rhythms to structure disease pathology and etiology.","1442":"Infectious disease management relies on accurate characterization of disease progression so that transmission can be prevented. Slowly progressing infectious diseases can be difficult to characterize because of a latency period between the time an individual is infected and when they show clinical signs of disease. The introduction of Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP), the cause of Johne's disease, onto a dairy farm could be undetected by farmers for years before any animal shows clinical signs of disease. In this time period infected animals may shed thousands of colony forming units. Parameterizing trajectories through disease states from infection to clinical disease can help farmers to develop control programs based on targeting individual disease state, potentially reducing both transmission and production losses due to disease. We suspect that there are two distinct progression pathways; one where animals progress to a high-shedding disease state, and another where animals maintain a low-level of shedding without clinical disease. We fit continuous-time hidden Markov models to multi-year longitudinal fecal sampling data from three US dairy farms, and estimated model parameters using a modified Baum-Welch expectation maximization algorithm. Using posterior decoding, we observed two distinct shedding patterns: cows that had observations associated with a high-shedding disease state, and cows that did not. This model framework can be employed prospectively to determine which cows are likely to progress to clinical disease and may be applied to characterize disease progression of other slowly progressing infectious diseases.","1443":"We report methods for growing and differentiating primary Pediatric Human Lung Epithelial (PHLE) cells from organ donor infant lung tissues. We use immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, quantitative RT-PCR, and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis to characterize the cellular and transcriptional heterogeneity of PHLE cells.Our data demonstrate that PHLE cells provide a novel in vitro human cell model that represents the pediatric airway epithelium, which can be used to study perinatal developmental and pediatric disease mechanisms.PHLE cells can be expanded in culture up to passage 6, with a doubling time of ~4 days, and retain attributes of highly enriched epithelial cells. PHLE cells can form resistant monolayers, and undergo differentiation when placed at air-liquid interface. When grown at Air-Liquid Interface (ALI), PHLE cells expressed markers of airway epithelial cell lineages. scRNAseq suggests the cultures contained 4 main sub-phenotypes defined by expression of FOXJ1, KRT5, MUC5B, and SFTPB. These cells are available to the research community through the Developing Lung Molecular Atlas Program Human Tissue Core.Current in vitro human lung epithelial cell models derived from adult tissues may not accurately represent all attributes that define homeostatic and disease mechanisms relevant to the pediatric lung.","1444":"In response to COVID-19, many countries have mandated social distancing and banned large group gatherings in order to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2. These social interventions along with vaccines remain the best way forward to reduce the spread of SARS CoV-2. In order to increase vaccine accessibility, states such as Virginia have deployed mobile vaccination centers to distribute vaccines across the state. When choosing where to place these sites, there are two important factors to take into account: accessibility and equity. We formulate a combinatorial problem that captures these factors and then develop efficient algorithms with theoretical guarantees on both of these aspects. Furthermore, we study the inherent hardness of the problem, and demonstrate strong impossibility results. Finally, we run computational experiments on real-world data to show the efficacy of our methods.","1445":"We estimated that vaccine efficacy against confirmed B\/Victoria infection was 68% (95% confidence interval, 33%, 88%), and post-vaccination HAI titers explained 57% of the effect of vaccination on protection.The hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay is an established correlate of protection for the inactivated influenza vaccine. However, the proportion of vaccine-induced protection that is mediated by the post-vaccination HAI titer has not been assessed.The majority of the effect of inactivated influenza vaccination in children is mediated by the increased HAI titer after vaccination; however, other components of the immune response to vaccination may also play a role in protection and should be further explored. Causal mediation analysis provides a framework to quantify the role of various mediators of protection.We used data from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of a split-virion inactivated influenza vaccine in children aged 6-17 years. Sera were collected before and 30 days after receipt of vaccination or placebo and tested by the HAI assay against B\/Brisbane\/60\/2008-like (B\/Victoria lineage). We fitted Cox proportional hazards models to the time to laboratory-confirmed influenza B. We used causal mediation analysis to estimate the proportion of the total effect of vaccination that was mediated by higher HAI titers.","1446":"Of 21212 HIV-uninfected adults in 5 communities, 4064 were identified for PrEP (2991 by empiric risk score, 1073 by self-identified risk).

Among individuals who self-identified for PrEP, predictors of early adoption included older age (2.30; 1.29-4.08) and serodiscordance (2.61; 1.01-6.76).Implementation of PrEP incorporating a population-based empiric risk score, self-identified risk, and rapid initiation, is feasible in rural East Africa. Strategies are needed to overcome barriers to PrEP uptake, particularly among women and youth.NCT01864603.Global guidelines recommend preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for individuals with substantial human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk. Data on PrEP uptake in sub-Saharan Africa outside of clinical trials are limited. We report on \"early adopters\" of PrEP in the Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health (SEARCH) study in rural Uganda and Kenya.After community mobilization and PrEP education, population-based HIV testing was conducted. HIV-uninfected adults were offered PrEP based on an empirically derived HIV risk score or self-identified HIV risk (if not identified by score). Using logistic regression, we analyzed predictors of early PrEP adoption (starting PrEP within 30 days vs delayed\/no start) among adults identified for PrEP.","1447":"Viral latency is a major barrier to curing HIV infection with antiretroviral therapy, and consequently, for eliminating the disease globally. The establishment, maintenance, and potential clearance of latent infection are complex dynamic processes and can be best understood and described with the help of mathematical models. Here we review the use of viral dynamics models for HIV, with a focus on applications to the latent reservoir. Such models have been used to explain the multiphasic decay of viral load during antiretroviral therapy, the early seeding of the latent reservoir during acute infection and the limited inflow during treatment, the dynamics of viral blips, and the phenomenon of posttreatment control. In addition, mathematical models have been used to predict the efficacy of potential HIV cure strategies, such as latency-reversing agents, early treatment initiation, or gene therapies, and to provide guidance for designing trials of these novel interventions.","1448":"Many serologic studies were done during and after the 2009 influenza pandemic, to estimate the cumulative incidence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections, but there are few comparative estimates of the incidence of influenza A(H3N2) virus infections during epidemics.We conducted a longitudinal serologic study in Hong Kong. We collected sera annually and tested samples from 2009-13 by HAI against the A\/Perth\/16\/2009(H3N2) virus, and samples from 2013-15 against the A\/Victoria\/361\/2011(H3N2) virus using the hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay. We estimated the cumulative incidence of infections based on 4-fold or greater rises in HAI titers in consecutive sera.We found that re-infections in each of the four H3N2 epidemics that occurred from 2010 through 2014 were rare. The largest H3N2 epidemic occurred with the lowest level of pre-epidemic immunity.There were four major H3N2 epidemics: (1) Aug-Oct 2010; (2) Mar-Jun 2012; (3) Jul-Oct 2013; and (4) Jun-Jul 2014. Between 516 and 619 relevant pairs of sera were available for each epidemic. We estimated that 9%, 19%, 7% and 7% of the population were infected in each epidemic, respectively, with higher incidence in children in epidemics 1 and 4.","1449":" at 2.07 (95%\u00a0credible interval:\u00a01.47-2.59) and the first case importation between 21 May and 18 June 2017.

How timing of delivery of the second dose affects infection burden but also prospects for the evolution of viral immune escape are critical questions. Both hinge on the strength and duration (i.e. robustness) of the immune response elicited by a single dose, compared to natural and two-dose immunity. Building on an existing immuno-epidemiological model, we find that in the short-term, focusing on one dose generally decreases infections, but longer-term outcomes depend on this relative immune robustness. We then explore three scenarios of selection, evaluating how different second dose delays might drive immune escape via a build-up of partially immune individuals. Under certain scenarios, we find that a one-dose policy may increase the potential for antigenic evolution. We highlight the critical need to test viral loads and quantify immune responses after one vaccine dose, and to ramp up vaccination efforts throughout the world.","1451":"Dengue viruses (DENV1-4) are mosquito-borne flaviviruses estimated to cause up to \u223c400 million infections and \u223c100 million dengue cases each year. Factors that contribute to protection from and risk of dengue and severe dengue disease have been studied extensively but are still not fully understood. Results from Phase 3 vaccine efficacy trials have recently become available for one vaccine candidate, now licensed for use in several countries, and more Phase 2 and 3 studies of additional vaccine candidates are ongoing, making these issues all the more urgent and timely. At the \"Summit on Dengue Immune Correlates of Protection\", held in Annecy, France, on March 8-9, 2016, dengue experts from diverse fields came together to discuss the current understanding of the immune response to and protection from DENV infection and disease, identify key unanswered questions, discuss data on immune correlates and plans for comparison of results across assays\/consortia, and propose a research agenda for investigation of dengue immune correlates, all in the context of both natural infection studies and vaccine trials.","1452":"A new computational framework for FLow cytometric Analysis of Rare Events (FLARE) has been developed specifically for fast and automatic identification of rare cell populations in very large samples generated by platforms like multi-parametric flow cytometry. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model and information-sharing via parallel computation, FLARE rapidly explores the high-dimensional marker-space to detect highly rare populations that are consistent across multiple samples. Further it can focus within specified regions of interest in marker-space to detect subpopulations with desired precision.","1453":"We used crowdsourced data on COVID-19 and linked them to county-level demographics, smoking rates, and chronic diseases. We fitted a Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal model using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm in R-studio. We mapped the estimated prevalence rates using ArcGIS 10.8, and identified hotspots using Gettis-Ord local statistics.Our findings show a rapid spread of COVID-19 across urban and rural areas in 21 days. Studies based on quality data are needed to explain further the role of social determinants of health on COVID-19 prevalence.In the rural counties, the mean prevalence of COVID-19 increased from 3.6 per 100,000 population to 43.6 per 100,000 within 3 weeks from April 3 to April 22, 2020. In the urban counties, the median prevalence of COVID-19 increased from 10.1 per 100,000 population to 107.6 per 100,000 within the same period. The COVID-19 adjusted prevalence rates in rural counties were substantially elevated in counties with higher black populations, smoking rates, and obesity rates. Counties with high rates of people aged 25-49 years had increased COVID-19 prevalence rates.There are growing signs that the COVID-19 virus has started to spread to rural areas and can impact the rural health care system that is already stretched and lacks resources. To aid in the legislative decision process and proper channelizing of resources, we estimated and compared the county-level change in prevalence rates of COVID-19 by rural-urban status over 3 weeks. Additionally, we identified hotspots based on estimated prevalence rates.","1454":"Substantial declines in anogenital warts and male HPV-related cancer incidence are projected to occur following an offer of vaccination to MSM. MSM not attending GUM clinics will partially benefit from herd protection. Offering vaccination to HIV-positive MSM up to age 40 is likely to be cost-effective if vaccine procurement and administration costs are below \u00a396.50 a dose. At \u00a348 a dose, offering vaccination to all MSM up to age 40 is likely to be cost-effective.Quadrivalent HPV vaccination of MSM via GUM clinics is likely to be an effective and cost-effective way of reducing the burden of HPV-related disease in MSM.We evaluated the potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of offering vaccination to MSM who visit genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics. We used a mathematical model of HPV 6\/11\/16\/18 sexual transmission within an MSM population in England, parameterized with sexual behaviour, GUM attendance, HPV prevalence, HIV prevalence, warts, and cancer incidence data. Interventions considered were offering HPV vaccination to either HIV-positive MSM or MSM regardless of HIV status, for age bands 16-25, 16-30, 16-35, and 16-40 years.Men who have sex with men (MSM) have a high lifetime risk of anogenital warts and cancers related to infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). They also benefit less from herd protection than heterosexual males in settings with female-only HPV vaccination.","1455":"Extreme weather events have revealed the vulnerability of health care facilities and the extent of devastation to the community when they fail. With climate change anticipated to increase extreme weather and its impacts worldwide-severe droughts, floods, heat waves, and related vector-borne diseases-health care officials need to understand and address the vulnerabilities of their health care systems and take action to improve resiliency in ways that also meet sustainability goals. Generally, the health sector is among a country's largest consumers of energy and a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. Now it has the opportunity lead climate mitigation, while reducing energy, water, and other costs. This Special Report summarizes several initiatives and compares three toolkits for implementing sustainability and resiliency measures for health care facilities: the Canadian Health Care Facility Climate Change Resiliency Toolkit, the U.S. Sustainable and Climate Resilient Health Care Facilities Toolkit, and the PAHO SMART Hospitals Toolkit of the World Health Organization\/Pan American Health Organization. These tools and the lessons learned can provide a critical starting point for any health system in the Americas.","1456":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.2196\/20285.].","1457":"Ecological niches of major mite species and mite-borne pathogens are much more extensive than what have been observed, necessitating expansion of current filed surveillance.We mapped 549 species of blood-sucking mites belonging to 100 genera at the county level and eight mite-associated agents detected from 36 species of blood-sucking mites in China during 1978-2020. Impacts of climatic and environmental factors on the ecology of 21 predominant vector mites and a leading pathogen, Orientia tsutsugamushi, were assessed using boosted regression tree (BRT) models, and model-predicted risks were mapped. We also estimated the model-predicted number, area and population size of affected counties for each of the 21 mite species in China.Emerging mite-borne pathogens and associated disease burdens in recent decades are raising serious public health concerns, yet their distributions and ecology remain under-investigated. We aim to describe the geographical distributions of blood-sucking mites and mite-borne agents and to assess their ecological niches in China.Laelaps echidninus is the leading mite species that potentially affects 744 million people, followed by La. jettmari (517 million) and Eulaelaps stabularis (452 million). Leptotrombidium scutellare is the mite species harboring the highest variety of mite-borne agents including four Rickettsia species and two viruses, followed by Eu. stabularis (2 agents), L. palpale\u00a0(2) and La. echidninus (2). The top two agents that parasitize the largest number of mite species are O. tsutsugamushi (28 species) and hantavirus (8). Mammalian richness, annual mean temperature and precipitation of the driest quarter jointly determine the ecology of the mites, forming four clusters of major mite species with distinct geographic distributions. High-risk areas of O. tsutsugamushi are mainly distributed in southern and eastern coastal provinces where 71.5 million people live.","1458":"Clinician-led conversations about future care priorities occur infrequently with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on dialysis. This was a pilot study of structured serious illness conversations using the Serious Illness Conversation Guide (SICG) in a single dialysis clinic to assess acceptability of the approach and explore conversation themes and potential outcomes among patients with ESRD. Twelve individuals with ESRD on dialysis from a single outpatient dialysis clinic participated in this study. Participants completed a baseline demographics survey, engaged in a clinician-led structured serious illness conversation, and completed an acceptability questionnaire. Conversations were recorded, transcribed and thematically analyzed. The average age of participants was 68.8\u00a0years. The conversations averaged 20:53 in length. Ten participants (83%) felt that the conversation was held at the right time in their clinical course and eleven participants (91%) felt that it was worthwhile. Most participants (73%) reported neutral feelings about clinician use of a printed guide. Eleven participants (91%) reported no change in anxiety about their illness following the conversation, and five participants (42%) reported that the conversation increased their hopefulness about future quality of life. Thematic analysis revealed common perspectives on dialysis including that participants view in-center hemodialysis as temporary, compartmentalize their kidney disease, perceive narrowed life experiences and opportunities, and believe dialysis is their only option. This pilot study suggests that clinician-led structured serious illness conversations may be acceptable to patients with ESRD on dialysis. The themes identified can inform future serious illness conversations with dialysis patients.","1459":"Limitations in laboratory diagnostic capacity and reporting delays have hampered efforts to mitigate and control the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic globally. To augment traditional lab and hospital-based surveillance, Bangladesh established a participatory surveillance system for the public to self-report symptoms consistent with COVID-19 through multiple channels. Here, we report on the use of this system, which received over 3 million responses within two months, for tracking the COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh. Although we observe considerable noise in the data and initial volatility in the use of the different reporting mechanisms, the self-reported syndromic data exhibits a strong association with lab-confirmed cases at a local scale. Moreover, the syndromic data also suggests an earlier spread of the outbreak across Bangladesh than is evident from the confirmed case counts, consistent with predicted spread of the outbreak based on population mobility data. Our results highlight the usefulness of participatory syndromic surveillance for mapping disease burden generally, and particularly during the initial phases of an emerging outbreak.","1460":", with many SSA countries having planned campaigns for 2020. In the present study, we use COVID-19 and malaria transmission models to estimate the impact of disruption of malaria prevention activities and other core health services under four different COVID-19 epidemic scenarios. If activities are halted, the malaria burden in 2020 could be more than double that of 2019. In Nigeria alone, reducing case management for 6\u2009months and delaying LLIN campaigns could result in 81,000 (44,000-119,000) additional deaths. Mitigating these negative impacts is achievable, and LLIN distributions in particular should be prioritized alongside access to antimalarial treatments to prevent substantial malaria epidemics.","1461":"The extent of United States Great Plains grass agriculture has ebbed and flowed over decades in response to market incentives, government policies, technological innovations and weather patterns. Our thesis is that the land most responsive to these drivers is at the economic margin between grass-based production and cropping. Much of the eastern Dakotas is such an area, primarily under crop-based agriculture although grass remains an important land use. We surveyed land operators in the area on their views about motivators for land use choices. Their views are largely consistent with the economic margin viewpoint. The importance of crop output prices, crop input prices, innovations in cropping equipment and weather patterns on land use decisions grow as one moves north toward the economic margin. Land in more highly sloped areas is more sensitive to crop prices and crop insurance policies. Consistent with human capital theory, older operators are generally less responsive to factors that affect land use. Those renting more land, being more exposed to market forces, are more responsive. As farm size increases, respondents declared higher land use sensitivity to policy issues and technological innovations, suggesting that scale effects render land units more sensitive to land use change drivers.","1462":"Meditation practices have been claimed to have a positive effect on the regulation of mood and emotions for quite some time by practitioners, and in recent times there has been a sustained effort to provide a more precise description of the influence of meditation on the human brain. Longitudinal studies have reported morphological changes in cortical thickness and volume in selected brain regions due to meditation practice, which is interpreted as an evidence its effectiveness beyond the subjective self reporting. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) or electroencephalography to quantify the changes in brain activity during meditation practice represents a challenge, as no clear hypothesis about the spatial or temporal pattern of such changes is available to date. In this article we consider MEG data collected during meditation sessions of experienced Buddhist monks practicing focused attention (Samatha) and open monitoring (Vipassana) meditation, contrasted by resting state with eyes closed. The MEG data are first mapped to time series of brain activity averaged over brain regions corresponding to a standard Destrieux brain atlas. Next, by bootstrapping and spectral analysis, the data are mapped to matrices representing random samples of power spectral densities in [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] frequency bands. We use linear discriminant analysis to demonstrate that the samples corresponding to different meditative or resting states contain enough fingerprints of the brain state to allow a separation between different states, and we identify the brain regions that appear to contribute to the separation. Our findings suggest that the cingulate cortex, insular cortex and some of the internal structures, most notably the accumbens, the caudate and the putamen nuclei, the thalamus and the amygdalae stand out as separating regions, which seems to correlate well with earlier findings based on longitudinal studies.","1463":"Lyme disease (LD) is a tick-borne zoonotic illness caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. Texas is considered a non-endemic state for LD and the spatial distribution of the state's reported LD cases is unknown.There was significant positive spatial autocorrelation of LD incidence in Texas with Moran's I of 0.41 (p\u2009=\u20090.001). LISA revealed significant variation in the spatial distribution of human LD in Texas. First, we identified a high-risk cluster in Central Texas, in a region that is thought to be beyond the geographical range of the main vector, Ixodes scapularis. Second, the eastern part of Texas, which is thought to provide the most suitable habitat for I. scapularis, did not appear to be a high-risk area. Third, LD cases were reported from several counties in western Texas, a region considered unsuitable for the survival of Ixodes ticks.We analyzed human LD cases reported to the Texas Department of State Health Services (TX-DSHS) between 2000 and 2011 using exploratory spatial analysis with the objective to investigate the spatial patterns of LD in Texas. Case data were aggregated at the county level, and census data were used as the population at risk. Empirical Bayesian smoothing was performed to stabilize the variance. Global Moran's I was calculated to assess the presence and type of spatial autocorrelation. Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) was used to determine the location of spatial clusters and outliers.These results emphasize the need for follow-up investigations to determine whether the identified spatial pattern is due to: clustering of misdiagnosed cases, clustering of patients with an out-of state travel history, or presence of a clustered unknown enzootic cycle of B. burgdorferi in Texas. This would enable an improved surveillance and reporting of LD in Texas.","1464":"An accurate forecast of the solar wind plasma and magnetic field properties is a crucial capability for space weather prediction. However, thus far, it has been limited to the large\u2010scale properties of the solar wind plasma or the arrival time of a coronal mass ejection from the Sun. As yet there are no reliable forecasts for the north\u2010south interplanetary magnetic field component, B n (or, equivalently, B z ). In this study, we develop a technique for predicting the magnetic and plasma state of the solar wind \u0394t hours into the future (where \u0394t can range from 6 h to several weeks) based on a simple pattern recognition algorithm. At some time, t , the algorithm takes the previous \u0394t hours and compares it with a sliding window of \u0394t hours running back all the way through the data. For each window, a Euclidean distance is computed. These are ranked, and the top 50 are used as starting point realizations from which to make ensemble forecasts of the next \u0394t hours. We find that this approach works remarkably well for most solar wind parameters such as v , n p , T p , and even B r and B t , but only modestly better than our baseline model for B n . We discuss why this is so and suggest how more sophisticated techniques might be applied to improve the prediction scheme.","1465":"We included 1982 eligible deaths (with minimally invasive tissue sampling performed) that occurred between Dec 9, 2016, and Feb 29, 2020, including 556 stillbirths, 828 neonatal deaths, and 598 child deaths. Of these 1982 deaths across all seven CHAMPS sites, 393 (71%) stillbirths, 583 (70%) neonatal deaths, and 487 (81%) child deaths were deemed preventable. The most recommended measures to prevent deaths were improvements in antenatal or obstetric care (recommended for 44% of stillbirths and 31% of neonatal deaths), clinical management and quality of care (stillbirths 26%, neonates 32%, children 46%), health-seeking behaviour (children 24%), and health education (children 22%). Given that 70% of under-5 deaths are stillbirths and neonatal deaths, an intervention that focuses on these age groups (eg, improved antenatal care) could prevent the most under-5 deaths.We used standardised, population-based, mortality surveillance data collected by CHAMPS from seven sites (Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and South Africa) to understand preventable causes of death in children younger than 5 years. Deaths were investigated with minimally invasive tissue sampling, a post-mortem approach using biopsy needles for sampling key organs and body fluids. For each death, an expert panel reviewed case data to determine whether the death was preventable and (if preventable) provided recommendations as to how the death could have been avoided. We evaluated which health system improvements could have prevented the most deaths among those who underwent minimally invasive tissue sampling for each age group: stillbirths, neonatal deaths (aged <28 days), and infant or child deaths (aged 1 month to <5 years).Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1126780).Globally, mortality in children younger than 5 years has been decreasing over the past few decades, but high under-5 mortality persists across regions of sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. Interventions-such as improved quality of clinical and antenatal care, better access to emergency obstetrical procedures, better triage and risk stratification, better immunisation coverage, or infection control measures-could substantially reduce deaths, but it is unclear which strategies could save the most lives. We aimed to use data from the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) network to examine which health-care and public health improvements could have prevented the most deaths.These data indicate areas in which greater focus on improving existing systems could prevent the most deaths. Investments in interventions such as better access to antenatal care, improvements in clinical practice, and public education campaigns could substantially reduce child mortality.","1466":" prior to the second wave. A model explains this unexpected finding as a result of transient dynamics and the multiple timescales of relaxation during a non-stationary epidemic. Particularly, if an epidemic that seems initially contained after a first wave does not fully settle to its new quasi-equilibrium prior to changing circumstances or conditions that force a second wave, then indicators will show a decreasing rather than an increasing trend as a result of the persistent transient trajectory of the first wave. Our simulations show that this lack of timescale separation was to be expected during the second European epidemic wave of COVID-19. Overall, our results emphasize that the theory of critical slowing down applies only when the external forcing of the system across a critical point is slow relative to the internal system dynamics.","1467":"Although Plasmodium vivax parasites are the predominant cause of malaria outside of sub-Saharan Africa, they not always prioritised by elimination programmes. P. vivax is resilient and poses challenges through its ability to re-emerge from dormancy in the human liver. With observed growing drug-resistance and the increasing reports of life-threatening infections, new tools to inform elimination efforts are needed. In order to halt transmission, we need to better understand the dynamics of transmission, the movement of parasites, and the reservoirs of infection in order to design targeted interventions. The use of molecular genetics and epidemiology for tracking and studying malaria parasite populations has been applied successfully in P. falciparum species and here we sought to develop a molecular genetic tool for P. vivax. By assembling the largest set of P. vivax whole genome sequences (n = 433) spanning 17 countries, and applying a machine learning approach, we created a 71 SNP barcode with high predictive ability to identify geographic origin (91.4%). Further, due to the inclusion of markers for within population variability, the barcode may also distinguish local transmission networks. By using P. vivax data from a low-transmission setting in Malaysia, we demonstrate the potential ability to infer outbreak events. By characterising the barcoding SNP genotypes in P. vivax DNA sourced from UK travellers (n = 132) to ten malaria endemic countries predominantly not used in the barcode construction, we correctly predicted the geographic region of infection origin. Overall, the 71 SNP barcode outperforms previously published genotyping methods and when rolled-out within new portable platforms, is likely to be an invaluable tool for informing targeted interventions towards elimination of this resilient human malaria.","1468":"In many repeat diseases, such as Huntington's disease (HD), ongoing repeat expansions in affected tissues contribute to disease onset, progression and severity. Inducing contractions of expanded repeats by exogenous agents is not yet possible. Traditional approaches would target proteins driving repeat mutations. Here we report a compound, naphthyridine-azaquinolone (NA), that specifically binds slipped-CAG DNA intermediates of expansion mutations, a previously unsuspected target. NA efficiently induces repeat contractions in HD patient cells as well as en masse contractions in medium spiny neurons of HD mouse striatum. Contractions are specific for the expanded allele, independently of DNA replication, require transcription across the coding CTG strand and arise by blocking repair of CAG slip-outs. NA-induced contractions depend on active expansions driven by MutS\u03b2. NA injections in HD mouse striatum reduce mutant HTT protein aggregates, a biomarker of HD pathogenesis and severity. Repeat-structure-specific DNA ligands are a novel avenue to contract expanded repeats.","1469":"Antibiotic use provided little explanatory power for the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance. Transmission of resistant bacteria in this setting through unsanitary living conditions likely overwhelms incremental changes in antibiotic use. Under such circumstances, sanitation, hygiene, and disease transmission are the limiting factors for reducing the prevalence of resistant bacteria.Two-hundred households were enrolled in a 5-month longitudinal study. One adult (\u2265\u200918\u00a0years) and one child (\u2264\u20095\u00a0years) participated per household. Biweekly interviews (n\u2009=\u20091516) that included questions on water, sanitation, hygiene, and antibiotic use in the previous two weeks were conducted, and 2341 stool, 2843 hand swabs and 1490 drinking water samples collected. Presumptive E. coli (n\u2009=\u200934,042) were isolated and tested for susceptibility to nine antibiotics.The relationship between antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance varies with cultural, socio-economic, and environmental factors.

In this study, we propose a comprehensive framework to measure changes in (1) spillover risk, (2) interhuman transmission, and (3) morbidity\/mortality associated with infections based on 6 epidemiological key indicators derived from routine surveillance. We demonstrate the indicators' value for the retrospective or real-time assessment of changes in transmission and epidemiological characteristics using data collected through a long-standing, systematic, hospital-based surveillance system for Nipah virus in Bangladesh. We show that although interhuman transmission and morbidity\/mortality indicators were stable, the number and geographic extent of spillovers varied significantly over time. This combination of systematic surveillance and active tracking of transmission and epidemiological indicators should be applied to other high-risk emerging pathogens to prevent public health emergencies.","1472":"Throughout the study period, RV\/EV was detected in 54.7% (885\/1617) of ARIs with a respiratory pathogen detected. Most ARI episodes associated with RV\/EV occurred in females (59.1%) and children \u226417\u2009years old (64.2%). Those \u226417\u2009years were more likely to seek medical care. Compared to those not seeking medical care (n\u2009=\u2009686), those seeking medical care (n\u2009=\u2009199) had a longer duration of illness (5 vs. 7\u2009days) and were more likely to miss work\/school (16.4% vs. 47.7%) and\/or use antibiotics (3.6% vs. 34.2%). Co-detection occurred in 8% of ARIs of which 81% occurred in children. Co-detection was not associated with longer illness, more missed work\/or school, or antibiotic use.Non-medically attended and medically attended ARIs associated with RV\/EV resulted in clinical and socioeconomic burden, regardless of co-detection of other respiratory pathogens.To assess the clinical and socioeconomic burden associated with RV\/EV, a secondary analysis of data collected during a prospective, community-based ARI surveillance study was performed. From December 2012 to September 2017, adult and pediatric participants with ARIs had nasopharyngeal specimens obtained and tested by multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay. Characteristics and socioeconomic burden including missed school or work and\/or antibiotic use among participants who did and did not seek medical care and among participants with and without co-detection of another respiratory pathogen with RV\/EV were compared.The epidemiology, clinical features, and socioeconomic burden associated with detection of rhinoviruses (RV)\/enteroviruses (EV) from individuals in the community with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are not fully understood.","1473":"Predictable temporal dynamics of resistance levels have implications both for surveillance and control.Following a systematic review, a novel robust error meta-regression method for dose-response meta-analysis was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for carrying resistant bacteria during and following treatment compared to baseline. Probability density functions fitted to the resulting dose-response curves were then used to optimize the period during and\/or after treatment when resistant pathogens were most likely to be identified.Studies of Streptococcus pneumoniae treatment with \u03b2-lactam antibiotics demonstrated a peak in resistance prevalence among patients 4 days after completing treatment with a 3.32-fold increase in odds (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.71-6.46). Resistance waned more gradually than it emerged, returning to preexposure levels 1 month after treatment (OR, 0.98 [95% CI, .55-1.75]). Patient isolation during the peak dose-response period would be expected to reduce the risk that a transmitted pathogen is resistant equivalently to a 50% longer isolation window timed from the first day of treatment.Patient exposure to antibiotics promotes the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. The aim of this study was to identify whether the temporal dynamics of resistance emergence at the individual-patient level were predictable for specific pathogen-drug classes.","1474":". We found that parasites exposed to heterogeneous host populations evolved significantly less virulence than parasites exposed to homogeneous host populations over several hundred bacterial generations. Thus, host heterogeneity impeded parasite adaptation to host populations. While we detected trade-offs in virulence evolution, parasite adaptation to two specific host genotypes also resulted in modestly increased virulence against the reciprocal host genotypes. These results suggest that parasite adaptation to heterogeneous host populations may be impeded by both trade-offs and a reduction in the efficacy of selection as different host genotypes exert different selective pressures on a parasite population.","1475":"During the 2015-2017 Zika epidemic, dengue and chikungunya-two other viral diseases with the same vector as Zika-were also in circulation. Clinical presentation of these diseases can vary from person to person in terms of symptoms and severity, making it difficult to differentially diagnose them. Under these circumstances, it is possible that numerous cases of Zika could have been misdiagnosed as dengue or chikungunya, or vice versa. Given the importance of surveillance data for informing epidemiological analyses, our aim was to quantify the potential extent of misdiagnosis during this epidemic. Using basic principles of probability and empirical estimates of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, we generated revised estimates of reported cases of Zika that accounted for the accuracy of diagnoses made on the basis of clinical presentation with or without laboratory confirmation. Applying this method to weekly reported case data from 43 countries throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, we estimated that 944,700 (95% CrI: 884,900-996,400) Zika cases occurred when assuming all confirmed cases were diagnosed using molecular methods versus 608,400 (95% CrI: 442,000-821,800) Zika cases that occurred when assuming all confirmed cases were diagnosed using serological methods. Our results imply that misdiagnosis was more common in countries with proportionally higher reported cases of dengue and chikungunya, such as Brazil. Given that Zika, dengue, and chikungunya appear likely to co-circulate in the Americas and elsewhere for years to come, our methodology has the potential to enhance the interpretation of passive surveillance data for these diseases going forward. Likewise, our methodology could also be used to help resolve transmission dynamics of other co-circulating diseases with similarities in symptomatology and potential for misdiagnosis.","1476":"In this work we show that Incremental Machine Learning can be used to predict the classification of emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages, dynamically distinguishing between neutral variants and non-neutral ones, i.e. variants of interest or variants of concerns. Starting from the Spike protein primary sequences collected in the GISAID db, we have derived a set of k-mers features, i.e., aminoacid subsequences with fixed length k. We have then implemented a Logistic Regression Incremental Learner that was monthly tested on the variants collected since February 2020 until October 2021. The average value of balanced accuracy of the classifier is 0.72 \u00b1 0.2, which increased to 0.78 \u00b1 0.16 in the last 12 months. The alpha, beta, gamma, eta, kappa and delta variants were recognized as non-neutral variants with mean recall \u223c90%. In summary, incremental learning proved to be a useful instrument for pandemic surveillance, given its capability to update the model on new data over time.","1477":"It is crucial to characterize misuse and perceptions of health impacts and risks of insecticides at the local level, as well as to find common themes and patterns across populations to inform national and regional programs to prevent acute insecticide poisoning and increase community participation in insecticide-based vector control campaigns. We detected risky practices and beliefs about personal protective equipment, risk indicators, and safety levels that could inform such preventive campaigns, as well as trusted information sources such as agricultural stores for partnerships in disseminating information.The perceived risks associated with insecticides included both short- and long-term health impacts, and safety for children emerged as a priority. However, in some cases insecticides were reportedly applied in high-risk ways including application of insecticides directly to children and bedding. Some participants attempted to reduce the risk of insecticide use with informal, potentially ineffective personal protective equipment and by timing application when household members were away. Valued insecticide characteristics, such as strength and effectiveness, were often associated with negative characteristics such as odor and health impacts. \"Agropecuarios\" (agricultural supply stores) were considered a trusted source of information about insecticides and their health risks.The current body of research on insecticide use in Peru deals primarily with application of insecticides offered through Ministry of Health-led campaigns against vector-borne disease. However, there is a gap in the literature regarding the individual use, choice and perceptions of insecticides which may influence uptake of public health-based vector control initiatives and contribute to the thousands of deaths annually from acute pesticide poisoning in Peru.Residents (n = 49) of the Alto Selva Alegre and CC districts of peri-urban Arequipa participated in seven focus group discussions (FGD). Using a FGD guide, two facilitators led the discussion and conducted a role-playing activity. this activity, participants insecticides (represented by printed photos of insecticides available locally) and pretended to \"sell\" the insecticides to other participants, including describing their qualities as though they were advertising the insecticide. The exercise was designed to elicit perceptions of currently available insecticides. The focus groups also included questions about participants' preferences, use and experiences related to insecticides outside the context of this activity. Focus group content was transcribed, and qualitative data were analyzed with Atlas.ti and coded using an inductive process to generate major themes related to use and choice of insecticides, and perceived risks associated with insecticide use.","1478":"Antiretroviral therapy-naive HIV-1 infected infants experience poor viral containment and rapid disease progression compared to adults. Viral factors (e.g. transmitted cytotoxic T- lymphocyte (CTL) escape mutations) or infant factors (e.g. reduced CTL functional capacity) may explain this observation. We assessed CTL functionality by analysing selection in CTL-targeted HIV-1 epitopes following perinatal infection. HIV-1 gag, pol and nef sequences were generated from a historical repository of longitudinal specimens from 19 vertically infected infants. Evolutionary rate and selection were estimated for each gene and in CTL-restricted and non-restricted epitopes. Evolutionary rate was higher in nef and gag vs. pol, and lower in infants with non-severe immunosuppression vs. severe immunosuppression across gag and nef. Selection pressure was stronger in infants with non-severe immunosuppression vs. severe immunosuppression across gag. The analysis also showed that infants with non-severe immunosuppression had stronger selection in CTL-restricted vs. non-restricted epitopes in gag and nef. Evidence of stronger CTL selection was absent in infants with severe immunosuppression. These data indicate that infant CTLs can exert selection pressure on gag and nef epitopes in early infection and that stronger selection across CTL epitopes is associated with favourable clinical outcomes. These results have implications for the development of paediatric HIV-1 vaccines.","1479":"Anticoagulant drugs are commonly prescribed to prevent hypercoagulable states in patients with venous thromboembolism. The choice of the most efficient anticoagulant and the appropriate dosage regimen remain a complex problem because of the intersubject variability in the coagulation kinetics and the effect of blood flow. The rapid assessment of the patient-specific response to anticoagulant regimens would assist clinical decision-making and ensure efficient management of coagulopathy. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that combines computational modeling and deep learning for the fast prediction of the patient-specific response to anticoagulant regimens. We extend a previously developed model to explore the spatio-temporal dynamics of thrombin generation and thrombus formation under anticoagulation therapy. Using a 1D version of the model, we generate a dataset of thrombus formation for thousands of virtual patients by varying key parameters in their physiological range. We use this dataset to train an artificial neural network (ANN) and we use it to predict patient's response to anticoagulant therapy under flow. The algorithm is available and can be accessed through the link: https:\/\/github.com\/MPS7\/ML_coag. It yields an accuracy of 96 % which suggests that its usefulness can be assessed in a randomized clinical trial. The exploration of the model dynamics explains the decisions taken by the algorithm.","1480":"We analysed epidemiological factors from the 11th EVD outbreak to identify patient characteristics, epidemiological links, and transmission modes to explore virus spread through space, time, and age groups in the \u00c9quateur Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Trained field investigators and health professionals recorded data on suspected, probable, and confirmed cases, including demographic characteristics, possible exposures, symptom onset and signs and symptoms, and potentially exposed contacts. We used blood samples from individuals who were live suspected cases and oral swabs from individuals who were deceased to diagnose EVD. We applied whole-genome sequencing of 87\u00a0available Ebola virus genomes (from 130 individuals with EVD between May 19 and Sept 16, 2020), phylogenetic divergence versus time, and Bayesian reconstruction of phylogenetic trees to calculate viral substitution rates and study viral evolution. We linked the available epidemiological and genetic datasets to conduct a genomic and epidemiological study of the 11th EVD outbreak.WHO and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The Democratic Republic of the Congo has had 15 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks, from 1976\u00a0to 2023. On June 1, 2020, the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared an outbreak of EVD in the western \u00c9quateur Province (11th outbreak), proximal to the 2018 Tumba and Bikoro outbreak and concurrent with an outbreak in the eastern Nord\u00a0Kivu Province. In this Article, we assessed whether the 11th outbreak was genetically related to previous or concurrent EVD outbreaks and connected available epidemiological and genetic data to identify sources of possible zoonotic spillover, uncover additional unreported cases of nosocomial transmission, and provide a deeper investigation into the 11th outbreak.Integrating genetic and epidemiological data allowed for investigative fact-checking and verified patient-reported sources of possible zoonotic spillover. These results demonstrate that rapid genetic sequencing combined with epidemiological data can inform responders of the mechanisms of viral spread, uncover novel transmission modes, and provide a deeper understanding of the outbreak, which is ultimately needed for infection prevention and control during outbreaks.Between May 19 and Sept 16, 2020, 130 EVD (119 confirmed and 11 probable) cases were reported across 13\u00a0\u00c9quateur Province health zones. The individual identified as the index case reported frequent consumption of bat meat, suggesting the outbreak started due to zoonotic spillover. Sequencing revealed two circulating Ebola virus variants associated with this outbreak-a Mbandaka variant associated with the majority (97%) of cases and a Tumba-like variant with similarity to the ninth EVD outbreak in 2018. The Tumba-like variant exhibited a reduced substitution rate, suggesting transmission from a previous survivor of EVD.","1481":"The six-plex ddRT-PCR test was demonstrated to be highly suitable for detecting dual influenza infection cases. This assay is expected to be a useful diagnostic tool for clinical and research use.There are two influenza A subtypes (H1 and H3) and two influenza B lineages (Victoria and Yamagata) that currently co-circulate in humans. In this study, we report the development of a six-plex droplet digital RT-PCR (ddRT-PCR) assay that can detect HA and M segments of influenza A (H1, H3, and M) and influenza B (Yamagata HA, Victoria HA, and M) viruses in a single reaction mixture. It can simultaneously detect six different nucleic acid targets in a ddRT-PCR platform.The assay has a wide dynamic range, and it has good reproducibility within and between runs. The limit of quantification of each target in this assay ranged from 15 copies\/reaction for influenza B Victoria M gene to 45 copies\/reaction for influenza B Yamagata M gene. In addition, this assay can accurately quantify each of these targets in samples containing viral RNAs from two different viruses that were mixed in a highly skewed ratio. Typing, subtyping, and lineage differentiation data of 55 tested clinical respiratory specimens were found to be identical to those deduced from standard monoplex qRT-PCR assays.The six-plex ddRT-PCR used in this study is an amplitude-based multiplex assay. The analytical performance of the assay was evaluated. Correlation with standard qRT-PCR methodology was assessed using 55 clinical samples.","1482":"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in policy, shifts in behavior, and the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants spurred multiple waves of transmission. Accurate assessments of the changing risks were vital for ensuring adequate healthcare capacity, designing mitigation strategies, and communicating effectively with the public. Here, we introduce a model of COVID-19 transmission and vaccination that provided rapid and reliable projections as the BA.1, BA.4 and BA.5 variants emerged and spread across the US. For example, our three-week ahead national projection of the early 2021 peak in COVID-19 hospitalizations was only one day later and 11.6-13.3% higher than the actual peak, while our projected peak in mortality was two days earlier and 0.22-4.7% higher than reported. We track population-level immunity from prior infections and vaccination in terms of the percent reduction in overall susceptibility relative to a completely naive population. As of October 1, 2022, we estimate that the US population had a 36.52% reduction in overall susceptibility to the BA.4\/BA.5 variants, with 61.8%, 15.06%, and 23.54% of immunity attributable to infections, primary series vaccination, and booster vaccination, respectively. We retrospectively projected the potential impact of expanding booster coverage starting on July 15, 2022, and found that a five-fold increase in weekly boosting rates would have resulted in 70% of people over 65 vaccinated by Oct 10, 2022 and averted 25,000 (95% CI: 14,400-35,700) deaths during the BA.4\/BA.5 surge. Our model provides coherent variables for tracking population-level immunity in the increasingly complex landscape of variants and vaccines and enables robust simulations of plausible scenarios for the emergence and mitigation of novel COVID variants.","1483":"When considering participant effects alone (scenario 1), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $3845 per additional screening mammogram. When including participant and network effects (scenario 2), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $1098 per additional screening mammogram.Our findings suggest that inclusion of network effects can contribute to a more precise, comprehensive assessment of interventions for underserved communities.A major strategy to reduce the impact of breast cancer (BC) among African Americans (AA) is patient navigation, defined here as individualized assistance for reducing barriers to healthcare use. The primary focus of this study was to estimate the added value of incorporating breast health promotion by navigated participants and the subsequent BC screenings that network members may obtain.In this study, we compared the cost-effectiveness of navigation across 2 scenarios. First, we examine the effect of navigation on AA participants (scenario 1). Second, we examine the effect of navigation on AA participants and their networks (scenario 2). We leverage data from multiple studies in South Chicago. Our primary outcome (BC screening) is intermediate, given limited available quantitative data on the long-term benefits of BC screening for AA populations.","1484":"Despite the global investment in One Health disease surveillance, it remains difficult and costly to identify and monitor the wildlife reservoirs of novel zoonotic viruses. Statistical models can guide sampling target prioritisation, but the predictions from any given model might be highly uncertain; moreover, systematic model validation is rare, and the drivers of model performance are consequently under-documented. Here, we use the bat hosts of betacoronaviruses as a case study for the data-driven process of comparing and validating predictive models of probable reservoir hosts. In early 2020, we generated an ensemble of eight statistical models that predicted host-virus associations and developed priority sampling recommendations for potential bat reservoirs of betacoronaviruses and bridge hosts for SARS-CoV-2. During a time frame of more than a year, we tracked the discovery of 47 new bat hosts of betacoronaviruses, validated the initial predictions, and dynamically updated our analytical pipeline. We found that ecological trait-based models performed well at predicting these novel hosts, whereas network methods consistently performed approximately as well or worse than expected at random. These findings illustrate the importance of ensemble modelling as a buffer against mixed-model quality and highlight the value of including host ecology in predictive models. Our revised models showed an improved performance compared with the initial ensemble, and predicted more than 400 bat species globally that could be undetected betacoronavirus hosts. We show, through systematic validation, that machine learning models can help to optimise wildlife sampling for undiscovered viruses and illustrates how such approaches are best implemented through a dynamic process of prediction, data collection, validation, and updating.","1485":"We present a framework for biodiversity metrics that organizes the growing panoply of metrics. Our framework distinguishes metrics based on the type of information-abundance, phylogeny, function-and two common properties-magnitude and variability. Our new metrics of phylogenetic diversity are based on a partition of the total branch lengths of a cladogram into the proportional share of each species, including: a measure of divergence which standardizes the amount of evolutionary divergence by species richness and time depth of the cladogram; a measure of regularity which is maximal when the tree is perfectly symmetrical so that all species have the same proportional branch lengths; a measure that combines information on the magnitude and variability of abundance with phylogenetic variability, and a measure of phylogenetically weighted effective mean abundance; and indicate how those metrics can be decomposed into \u03b1 and \u03b2 components. We illustrate the utility of these new metrics using empirical data on the bat fauna of Manu, Peru. Divergence was greatest in lowland rainforest and at the transition between cloud and elfin forests, and least in upper elfin forests and in cloud forests. In contrast, regularity was greatest in lowland rainforest, dipping to its smallest values in mid-elevation cloud forests, and then increasing in high elevation elfin forests. These patterns indicate that the first species to drop out with increasing elevation are ones that are closely related to other species in the metacommunity. Measures of the effective number of phylogenetically independent or distinct species decreased very rapidly with elevation, and \u03b2-diversity was larger. In contrast, a comparison of feeding guilds shows a different effect of phylogenetic patterning. Along the elevational gradient, each guild generally loses some species from each clade-rather than entire clades-explaining the maintenance of functional diversity as phylogenetic diversity decreases.","1486":"This paper presents a comprehensive agent-based model for the spread of an infection in a network of cities. Directional mobility is defined between each two cities and can take different values. The work examines the role that such mobility levels play in containing the infection with various vaccination coverage and age distributions. The results indicate that mobility reduction is sufficient to control the disease under all circumstances and full lockdowns are not a necessity. It has to be reduced to different ratios depending on the vaccination level and age distribution. A key finding is that increasing vaccination coverage above a certain level does not affect the mobility suppression level required to control the infection anymore for the cases of young population and heterogeneous age distributions. By investigating several migration and commuting patterns, it is found that shutting mobility in a few local places is favored against reducing mobility over the entire country network. In addition, commuting -and not migration-influences the spread level of the infection. The work offers an exclusive combined network-based and agent-based model that makes use of randomly generated mobility matrices.","1487":"The best-fitting model had 2 courses of infection in men, as was previously found for women: \"slow-clearing\" and \"fast-clearing.\" Only 68% (57%-78%) (posterior median and 95% credible interval [CrI]) of incident infections in men were slow-clearing, vs 77% (69%-84%) in women. The slow clearance rate in men (based on 6 months' follow-up) was 0.35 (.05-1.15) year-1 (posterior median and 95% CrI), corresponding to mean infection duration 2.84 (.87-18.79) years. This compares to 1.35 (1.13-1.63) years in women.We used data from published studies of chlamydia-infected men who were retested at a later date without having received treatment. Our analysis allowed new infections to take one of 1, 2, or 3 courses, each clearing at a different rate. We determined which of these 3 models had the most empirical support.Rigorous estimates for clearance rates of untreated chlamydia infections are important for understanding chlamydia epidemiology and designing control interventions, but were previously only available for women.Our estimated clearance rate is slower than previously assumed. Fewer infections become established in men than women but once established, they clear more slowly. This study provides an improved description of chlamydia's natural history to inform public health decision making. We describe how further data collection could reduce uncertainty in estimates.","1488":"Antibiotic resistance in bacteria limits the effect of corresponding antibiotics, and the classification of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is important for the treatment of bacterial infections and for understanding the dynamics of microbial communities. Although several methods have been developed to classify ARGs, none of them work well when the ARGs diverge from those in the reference ARG databases. We develop a novel method, ARG-SHINE, for ARG classification. ARG-SHINE utilizes state-of-the-art learning to rank machine learning approach to ensemble three component methods with different features, including sequence homology, protein domain\/family\/motif and raw amino acid sequences for the deep convolutional neural network. Compared with other methods, ARG-SHINE achieves better performance on two benchmark datasets in terms of accuracy, macro-average f1-score and weighted-average f1-score. ARG-SHINE is used to classify newly discovered ARGs through functional screening and achieves high prediction accuracy. ARG-SHINE is freely available at https:\/\/github.com\/ziyewang\/ARG_SHINE.","1489":"Cities across China implemented stringent social distancing measures in early 2020 to curb coronavirus disease outbreaks. We estimated the speed with which these measures contained transmission in cities. A 1-day delay in implementing social distancing resulted in a containment delay of 2.41 (95% CI 0.97-3.86) days.","1490":"The 2022 multicountry mpox outbreak concurrent with the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic further highlighted the need for genomic surveillance and rapid pathogen whole-genome sequencing. While metagenomic sequencing approaches have been used to sequence many of the early mpox infections, these methods are resource intensive and require samples with high viral DNA concentrations. Given the atypical clinical presentation of cases associated with the outbreak and uncertainty regarding viral load across both the course of infection and anatomical body sites, there was an urgent need for a more sensitive and broadly applicable sequencing approach. Highly multiplexed amplicon-based sequencing (PrimalSeq) was initially developed for sequencing of Zika virus, and later adapted as the main sequencing approach for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we used PrimalScheme to develop a primer scheme for human monkeypox virus that can be used with many sequencing and bioinformatics pipelines implemented in public health laboratories during the COVID-19 pandemic. We sequenced clinical specimens that tested presumptively positive for human monkeypox virus with amplicon-based and metagenomic sequencing approaches. We found notably higher genome coverage across the virus genome, with minimal amplicon drop-outs, in using the amplicon-based sequencing approach, particularly in higher PCR cycle threshold (Ct) (lower DNA titer) samples. Further testing demonstrated that Ct value correlated with the number of sequencing reads and influenced the percent genome coverage. To maximize genome coverage when resources are limited, we recommend selecting samples with a PCR Ct below 31 Ct and generating 1 million sequencing reads per sample. To support national and international public health genomic surveillance efforts, we sent out primer pool aliquots to 10 laboratories across the United States, United Kingdom, Brazil, and Portugal. These public health laboratories successfully implemented the human monkeypox virus primer scheme in various amplicon sequencing workflows and with different sample types across a range of Ct values. Thus, we show that amplicon-based sequencing can provide a rapidly deployable, cost-effective, and flexible approach to pathogen whole-genome sequencing in response to newly emerging pathogens. Importantly, through the implementation of our primer scheme into existing SARS-CoV-2 workflows and across a range of sample types and sequencing platforms, we further demonstrate the potential of this approach for rapid outbreak response.","1491":"We allocate surgery blocks to operating rooms (ORs) under random surgery durations. Given unknown distribution of the duration of each block, we investigate distributionally robust (DR) variants of two types of stochastic programming models using a moment-based ambiguous set. We minimize the total cost of opening ORs and allocating surgery blocks, while constraining OR overtime via chance constraints and via an expected penalty cost in the objective function, respectively in the two types of models. Following conic duality, we build equivalent 0\u00961 semidefinite programming (SDP) reformulations of the DR models and solve them using cutting-plane algorithms. For the DR chance-constrained model, we also derive a 0\u00961 second-order conic programming approximation to obtain less conservative solutions. We compare different models and solution methods by testing randomly generated instances. Our results show that the DR chance-constrained model better controls average and worst-case OR overtime, as compared to the stochastic programming and DR expected-penalty-based models. Our cutting-plane algorithms also outperform standard optimization solvers and efficiently solve 0\u00961 SDP formulations.","1492":"Knowledge of the main transmission routes, commonest symptoms and recommended prevention methods was mostly very high (>\u200980%) in both groups. There was lower awareness of aerosols, food and drink and pets as sources of transmission; of the correct duration for handwashing; recommended distance for social\/physical distancing; and about recommended types of face coverings. Information sources most used and most trusted were the workplace, work colleagues, health workers and television. The results were used to produce a set of targeted educational videos which addressed many of these gaps with subsequent improvements on retesting in a number of areas. This included improvements in handwashing practice with an increase in the number of areas correctly washed in 65.5% of the public, and 57.9% of healthcare workers. The videos were then further optimized with feedback from participants followed by another round of retesting.Detailed information on gaps in knowledge, attitudes and practice among the general public and healthcare workers regarding COVID-19 transmission and its prevention were obtained from a combination of questionnaires and observations. This was used to produce targeted educational videos which addressed these gaps with subsequent improvements on retesting. The resulting videos were then disseminated as a resource to aid in efforts to fight COVID-19 in Thailand and worldwide.Key infection prevention and control measures to limit transmission of COVID-19 include social distancing, hand hygiene, use of facemasks and personal protective equipment. However, these have limited or no impact if not applied correctly through lack of knowledge, inappropriate attitude or incorrect practice. In order to maximise the impact of infection prevention and control measures on COVID-19 spread, we undertook a study to assess and improve knowledge, attitudes and practice among 119 healthcare workers and 100 general public in Thailand. The study setting was two inpatient hospitals providing COVID-19 testing and treatment. Detailed information on knowledge, attitudes and practice among the general public and healthcare workers regarding COVID-19 transmission and its prevention were obtained from a combination of questionnaires and observations.","1493":"Blastocystis is one of the most common protozoa in the human gut and a zoonotic organism related to unsanitary living conditions. This protozoon shows a broad distribution, unclear symptomatology, and undefined pathogenicity. In Peru, studies report the presence of Blastocystis in many regions, but the highest prevalence levels are reported in Arequipa. The aim of this study was to link Blastocystis infection with social determinants of health. We recruited and surveyed 232 infected and uninfected participants from houses with at least one Blastocystis-infected person. All samples were concentrated by spin concentration method in saline solution, examined by wet mount under light microscopy and confirmed with methylene-stained stool smear. We found a human Blastocystis prevalence of 51.3% in the study sample. We also found statistical associations between Blastocystis infection and peri-urban location in the city as well as the use of alternative non-domiciliary water supplies, suggesting these are risk factors for human Blastocystis infection.","1494":"Funding for this study was provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1066146 and OPP1152146), the National Institutes of Health United States (R01AI158576 and R21AI163801 to MNK and CTP; K43TW012298 to FS; K01AI168493 to JMC; GOL was supported by K01AI145080.

It is generally associated with an acute gastrointestinal infection causing a self-limiting diarrheal episode. However, there is evidence that persistent\/recurrent carriage of Campylobacter also occurs. In hyperendemic settings the epidemiology and consequences of persistent Campylobacter enteric infections is poorly studied.Risk factors for and growth consequences of persistent Campylobacter infections detected by polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were evaluated with data from the MAL-ED birth cohort study in children 0-24 months of age between November 2009 and February 2012. A persistent Campylobacter infection was defined as three or more consecutive Campylobacter positive monthly stools.Across all study sites, 45.5% (781\/1715) of children experienced at least one persistent Campylobacter episode. The average cumulative duration of days in which children with persistent Campylobacter were positive for Campylobacter spp. was 150 days (inter-quartile range: 28-236 days). Children who experienced a persistent Campylobacter episode had an attained 24-month length-for-age (LAZ) score that was 0.23 (95% (CI):\u00a0-0.31,\u00a0-0.15) less than children without a persistent Campylobacter episode. Among children who had at least one episode of Campylobacter over a 3-month or 9-month window, persistent episodes were not significantly associated with poorer 3-month weight gain (-28.7\u00a0g, 95% CI:\u00a0-63.4\u00a0g, 6.0\u00a0g) but were associated with poorer 9-month linear growth (-0.134\u00a0cm 95% CI:\u00a0-0.246,\u00a0-0.022) compared to children with an episode that resolved within 31 days.Persistent\/recurrent Campylobacter infection is common among children and has a measurable negative impact on linear growth in early childhood.","1495":"Although the widespread use of indoors residual spraying (IRS) and insecticides treated bednets (ITNs; later replaced by long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs)) has led to a dramatic reduction of malaria burden in endemic areas, such usage has also resulted in the major challenge of the evolution of insecticide resistance in the mosquito population in those areas. Thus, efforts to combat malaria also include the urgent problem of effectively managing insecticide resistance. This study is based on the design and analysis of a new mathematical model for assessing the impact of insecticides resistance in the mosquito population (due to widespread use of IRS and ITNs) on the transmission dynamics and control of malaria in a community. The model, which couples disease epidemiology with vector population genetics, incorporates several fitness costs associated with insecticide resistance. Detailed rigorous analysis of the model is presented. Using data and parameter values relevant to malaria dynamics in moderate and high malaria transmission settings in some parts of Ethiopia, simulations of the model show that, while the ITNs-IRS strategy can lead to the effective control of the disease in both the moderate and high malaria transmission setting if the ITNs coverage level in the community is high enough (regardless of the level of IRS coverage), it fails to manage insecticide resistance (as measured in terms of the frequency of resistant allele at equilibrium in the community). It is further shown that the effective size of the coverage level of the ITNs and IRS required to effectively control the disease, while effectively managing insecticide resistance in the mosquito population, depends on the magnitude of the level of resistant allele dominance (in mosquitoes with heterozygous genotype) and several fitness costs associated with the insecticide resistance in the vector population. For instance, in a moderate transmission setting, malaria burden can be reduced to low levels of endemicity (even with low coverage of ITNs and IRS), and insecticide resistance effectively managed, if the fitness costs of resistance are at their assumed baseline values. Such reduction is not achievable if the fitness costs of resistance are lower than the baseline values.","1496":" alignment-free methods. For dependable comparison of metagenomic samples, our newly developed alignment-free methods with reads binning outperformed alignment-free methods without reads binning in detecting the relationship among microbial communities, including whether they form groups or change according to some environmental gradients.","1497":"Predicting the specific magnitude and the temporal peak of the epidemic of individual local outbreaks is critical for infectious disease control. Previous studies have indicated that significant differences in spatial transmission and epidemic magnitude of dengue were influenced by multiple factors, such as mosquito population density, climatic conditions, and population movement patterns. However, there is a lack of studies that combine the above factors to explain their complex nonlinear relationships in dengue transmission and generate accurate predictions. Therefore, to study the complex spatial diffusion of dengue, this research combined the above factors and developed a network model for spatiotemporal transmission prediction of dengue fever using metapopulation networks based on human mobility. For improving the prediction accuracy of the epidemic model, the ensemble adjusted Kalman filter (EAKF), a data assimilation algorithm, was used to iteratively assimilate the observed case data and adjust the model and parameters. Our study demonstrated that the metapopulation network-EAKF system provided accurate predictions for city-level dengue transmission trajectories in retrospective forecasts of 12 cities in Guangdong province, China. Specifically, the system accurately predicts local dengue outbreak magnitude and the temporal peak of the epidemic up to 10 wk in advance. In addition, the system predicted the peak time, peak intensity, and total number of dengue cases more accurately than isolated city-specific forecasts. The general metapopulation assimilation framework presented in our study provides a methodological foundation for establishing an accurate system with finer temporal and spatial resolution for retrospectively forecasting the magnitude and temporal peak of dengue fever outbreaks. These forecasts based on the proposed method can be interoperated to better support intervention decisions and inform the public of potential risks of disease transmission.","1498":"Preventive chemotherapy was administered to 3.2 million Sierra Leoneans in 13 health districts for lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, and soil transmitted helminthes from October 2008 to February 2009. This paper aims to report the findings of a coverage survey conducted in 2009, compare the coverage survey findings with two reported rates for lymphatic filariasis coverage obtained using pre-mass drug administration (MDA) registration and national census projections, and use the comparison to understand the best source of population estimates in calculating coverage for NTD programming in Sierra Leone.These results from Sierra Leone illustrate the importance of choosing the right denominator for calculating treatment coverage for NTD programs. While routinely reported coverage results using national census data are often good enough for programmatic decision making, census projections can quickly become outdated where there is substantial migration, e.g. due to the impact of civil war, with changing economic opportunities, in urban settings, and where there are large migratory populations. In districts where this is known to be the case, well implemented pre-MDA registration can provide better population estimates. Pre-MDA registration should, however, be implemented correctly to reduce the risk of missing pockets of the population, especially in urban settings.Community drug distributors (CDDs) conducted a pre- MDA registration of the population. Two coverage rates for MDA for lymphatic filariasis were subsequently calculated using the reported number treated divided by the total population from: 1) the pre-MDA register and 2) national census projections. A survey was conducted to validate reported coverage data. 11,602 persons participated (response rate of 76.8%). Overall, reported coverage data aggregated to the national level were not significantly different from surveyed coverage (z-test >0.05). However, estimates based on pre-MDA registration have higher agreement with surveyed coverage (mean Kendall's W = 0.68) than coverage calculated with census data (mean Kendall's = 0.59), especially in districts with known large-scale migration, except in a highly urban district where it was more challenging to conduct a pre-MDA registration appropriately. There was no significant difference between coverage among males versus females when the analyses were performed excluding those women who were pregnant at the time of MDA. The surveyed coverage estimate was near or below the minimum 65% epidemiological coverage target for lymphatic filariasis MDA in all districts.","1499":"While most cases of acute cough are self-limiting, antibiotics are prescribed to over 50%. This proportion is inappropriately high given that benefit from treatment with amoxicillin could only be demonstrated in adults with pneumonia (based on chest radiograph) or combined viral-bacterial infection (based on modern microbiological methodology). As routine use of chest radiographs and microbiological testing is costly, clinical prediction rules could be used to identify these patient subsets. In this secondary analysis of data from a multicentre randomised controlled trial in adults presenting to primary care with acute cough, we used prediction rules for pneumonia or combined infection and assessed the effect of amoxicillin in patients predicted to have pneumonia or combined infection on symptom duration, symptom severity and illness deterioration. In total, 2056 patients that fulfilled all inclusion criteria were randomised, 1035 to amoxicillin, 1021 to placebo. Neither patients with a predicted pneumonia nor patients with a predicted combined infection were significantly more likely to benefit from amoxicillin. While the studied clinical prediction rules may help primary care clinicians to reduce antibiotic prescribing for low-risk patients, they did not identify adult acute cough patients that would benefit from amoxicillin treatment.","1500":"This surveillance activity served as an early warning system that could detect RVF disease in animals before spillover to humans. It was also an excellent pilot for designing and implementing syndromic surveillance in animals in the country, which is now being rolled out using a mobile phone-based data reporting technology as part of the global health security system.In response to the alert, the Kenya Directorate of Veterinary Services (KDVS) carried out an enhanced syndromic surveillance system between November 2015 and February 2016, targeting 22 RVF high-risk counties in the country as identified previously through risk mapping. The surveillance collected data on RVF-associated syndromes in cattle, sheep, goats, and camels from >1100 farmers through 66 surveillance officers. During the 14-week surveillance period, the KDVS received 10,958 reports from participating farmers and surveillance officers, of which 362 (3.3%) had at least one syndrome. The reported syndromes included 196 (54.1%) deaths in young livestock, 133 (36.7%) abortions, and 33 (9.1%) hemorrhagic diseases, with most occurring in November and December, the period of heaviest rainfall. Of the 69 herds that met the suspect RVF herd definition (abortion in flooded area), 24 (34.8%) were defined as probable (abortions, mortalities in the young ones, and\/or hemorrhagic signs) but none were confirmed.In mid-2015, the United States' Pandemic Prediction and Forecasting Science and Technical Working Group of the National Science and Technology Council, Food and Agriculture Organization Emergency Prevention Systems, and Kenya Meteorological Department issued an alert predicting a high possibility of El-Ni\u00f1o rainfall and Rift Valley Fever (RVF) epidemic in Eastern Africa.","1501":" (MAP) is the causative agent of Johne's disease in ruminants, which has important health consequences for dairy cattle, and enormous economic consequences for the dairy industry. Understanding which genes in this bacterium are correlated with key disease phenotypes can lead to functional experiments targeting these genes and ultimately lead to improved control strategies. This study represents a rare example of a prolonged longitudinal study of dairy cattle where the disease was measured and the bacteria were isolated from the same cows. The genome sequences of over 300 MAP isolates were analyzed for genes that were correlated with a wide range of Johne's disease phenotypes. A number of genes were identified that were significantly associated with several aspects of the disease and suggestive of further experimental follow-up.","1502":"Growing evidence demonstrates the epigenetic modulation as a key event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Furthermore, recent data suggests that the epigenetic regulation by the methyltransferase G9a is a crucial mechanism involved in learning and memory formation. Taking this into account, we hereby provide genomics data from pharmacological intervention with UNC0642, a potent and selective G9a\/GLP in SAMP8 mice, a model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have generated novel RNA-seq and miRNA-seq data for three groups, healthy SAMR1, SAMP8 control and SAMP8 treated with UNC0642 (5\u00a0mg\/Kg). Thus, the new data can be used to find miRNA regulation, and the mRNA's modified in AD under G9a\/GLP inhibition.","1503":"Through half-day group model-building sessions conducted as part of evaluation site visits to each community between 2010 and 2013, a total of 50 causal loop diagrams were produced for 49 communities (1 community had 2 causal loop diagrams representing different geographic regions). The analysis focused on the following evaluation questions: (1) What were the most prominent variables in the causal loop diagrams across communities? (2) What were the major feedback structures across communities? (3) What implications from the synthesized causal loop diagram can be translated to policy makers, practitioners, evaluators, funders, and other community representatives?Community partnerships to promote healthy eating and active living in order to prevent childhood obesity face a number of challenges. Systems science tools combined with group model-building techniques offer promising methods that use transdisciplinary team-based approaches to improve understanding of the complexity of the obesity epidemic. This article presents evaluation methods and findings from 49 Healthy Kids, Healthy Communities sites funded to implement policy, system, and environmental changes from 2008 to 2014.The application of systems thinking tools combined with group model-building techniques creates opportunities to define and characterize complex systems in a manner that draws on the authentic voice of residents and community partners.A total of 590 individuals participated with an average of 12 participants per session. Participants' causal loop diagrams included a total of 227 unique variables in the following major subsystems: healthy eating policies and environments, active living policies and environments, health and health behaviors, partnership and community capacity, and social determinants. In a synthesized causal loop diagram representing variables identified by at least 20% of the communities, many feedback structures emerged and several themes are highlighted with respect to implications for policy and practice as well as assessment and evaluation.","1504":"Screening mammography, treatment of stage I to III breast cancer, and treatment of metastatic breast cancer.Using aggregated observational and clinical trial data on the dissemination and effects of screening and treatment, 4 Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) models simulated US breast cancer mortality rates. Death due to breast cancer, overall and by estrogen receptor and ERBB2 (formerly HER2) status, among women aged 30 to 79 years in the US from 1975 to 2019 was simulated.According to 4 simulation models, breast cancer screening and treatment in 2019 were associated with a 58% reduction in US breast cancer mortality compared with interventions in 1975. Simulations suggested that treatment for stage I to III breast cancer was associated with approximately 47% of the mortality reduction, whereas treatment for metastatic breast cancer was associated with 29% of the reduction and screening with 25% of the reduction.Breast cancer mortality in the US declined between 1975 and 2019. The association of changes in metastatic breast cancer treatment with improved breast cancer mortality is unclear.Model-estimated age-adjusted breast cancer mortality rate associated with screening, stage I to III treatment, and metastatic treatment relative to the absence of these exposures was assessed, as was model-estimated median survival after breast cancer metastatic recurrence.The breast cancer mortality rate in the US (age adjusted) was 48\/100\u202f000 women in 1975 and 27\/100\u202f000 women in 2019. In 2019, the combination of screening, stage I to III treatment, and metastatic treatment was associated with a 58% reduction (model range, 55%-61%) in breast cancer mortality. Of this reduction, 29% (model range, 19%-33%) was associated with treatment of metastatic breast cancer, 47% (model range, 35%-60%) with treatment of stage I to III breast cancer, and 25% (model range, 21%-33%) with mammography screening. Based on simulations, the greatest change in survival after metastatic recurrence occurred between 2000 and 2019, from 1.9 years (model range, 1.0-2.7 years) to 3.2 years (model range, 2.0-4.9 years). Median survival for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive\/ERBB2-positive breast cancer improved by 2.5 years (model range, 2.0-3.4 years), whereas median survival for ER-\/ERBB2- breast cancer improved by 0.5 years (model range, 0.3-0.8 years).To simulate the relative associations of breast cancer screening, treatment of stage I to III breast cancer, and treatment of metastatic breast cancer with improved breast cancer mortality.","1505":"Helicobacter pylori chronically infects the stomach of approximately half of the world's population. Manifestation of clinical diseases associated with H. pylori infection, including cancer, is driven by strain properties and host responses; and as chronic infection persists, both are subject to change. Previous studies have documented frequent and extensive within-host bacterial genetic variation. To define how within-host diversity contributes to phenotypes related to H. pylori pathogenesis, this project leverages a collection of 39 clinical isolates acquired prospectively from a single subject at two time points and from multiple gastric sites. During the six years separating collection of these isolates, this individual, initially harboring a duodenal ulcer, progressed to gastric atrophy and concomitant loss of acid secretion. Whole genome sequence analysis identified 1,767 unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across isolates and a nucleotide substitution rate of 1.3x10-4 substitutions\/site\/year. Gene ontology analysis identified cell envelope genes among the genes with excess accumulation of nonsynonymous SNPs (nSNPs). A maximum likelihood tree based on genetic similarity clusters isolates from each time point separately. Within time points, there is segregation of subgroups with phenotypic differences in bacterial morphology, ability to induce inflammatory cytokines, and mouse colonization. Higher inflammatory cytokine induction in recent isolates maps to shared polymorphisms in the Cag PAI protein, CagY, while rod morphology in a subgroup of recent isolates mapped to eight mutations in three distinct helical cell shape determining (csd) genes. The presence of subgroups with unique genetic and phenotypic properties suggest complex selective forces and multiple niches within the stomach during chronic infection.","1506":"Communication between immune cells through direct contact is a critical feature of immune responses. Here, we developed a novel high-throughput method to study the transcriptome and adaptive immune receptor repertoire of single cells forming complexes without needing bioinformatic deconvolution. We found that T cells and monocytes forming complexes in blood during active tuberculosis (TB) and dengue hold unique transcriptomic signatures indicative of TCR\/MCH-II immune synapses. Additionally, T cells in complexes showed enrichment for effector phenotypes, imaging and transcriptomic features of active TCR signaling, and increased immune activity at diagnosis compared to after anti-TB therapy. We also found evidence for bidirectional RNA exchange between T cells and monocytes, since complexes were markedly enriched for \"dual-expressing\" cells (i.e., co-expressing T cell and monocyte genes). Thus, studying immune cell complexes at a single-cell resolution offers novel perspectives on immune synaptic interactions occurring in blood during infection.","1507":" Resultant data will inform on social contact patterns in rural and urban areas of a previously unstudied population. Ensuing data will be used to parameterize mathematical simulation models of transmission of a range of respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, and used to explore the impact of intervention measures such as vaccination and social distancing.","1508":"Deployment of clinical testing on a massive scale was an essential control measure for curtailing the burden of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and the magnitude of the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic during its waves. As the pandemic progressed, new preventive and surveillance mechanisms emerged. Implementation of vaccine programs, wastewater (WW) surveillance, and at-home COVID-19 antigen tests reduced the demand for mass SARS-CoV-2 testing. Unfortunately, reductions in testing and test reporting rates also reduced the availability of public health data to support decision-making. This paper proposes a sequential Bayesian approach to estimate the COVID-19 test positivity rate (TPR) using SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations measured in WW through an adaptive scheme incorporating changes in virus dynamics. The proposed modeling framework was applied to WW surveillance data from two WW treatment plants in California; the City of Davis and the University of California, Davis campus. TPR estimates are used to compute thresholds for WW data using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention thresholds for low (10% TPR) transmission. The effective reproductive number estimates are calculated using TPR estimates from the WW data. This approach provides insights into the dynamics of the virus evolution and an analytical framework that combines different data sources to continue monitoring COVID-19 trends. These results can provide public health guidance to reduce the burden of future outbreaks as new variants continue to emerge. IMPORTANCE We propose a statistical model to correlate WW with TPR to monitor COVID-19 trends and to help overcome the limitations of relying only on clinical case detection. We pose an adaptive scheme to model the nonautonomous nature of the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic. The TPR is modeled through a Bayesian sequential approach with a beta regression model using SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations measured in WW as a covariable. The resulting model allows us to compute TPR based on WW measurements and incorporates changes in viral transmission dynamics through an adaptive scheme.","1509":"Official COVID-19 mortality statistics are strongly influenced by local diagnostic capacity, strength of the healthcare and vital registration systems, and death certification criteria and capacity, often resulting in significant undercounting of COVID-19 attributable deaths. Excess mortality, which is defined as the increase in observed death counts compared to a baseline expectation, provides an alternate measure of the mortality shock-both direct and indirect-of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we use data from civil death registers from a convenience sample of 90 (of 162) municipalities across the state of Gujarat, India, to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all-cause mortality. Using a model fit to weekly data from January 2019 to February 2020, we estimated excess mortality over the course of the pandemic from March 2020 to April 2021. During this period, the official government data reported 10,098 deaths attributable to COVID-19 for the entire state of Gujarat. We estimated 21,300 [95% CI: 20, 700, 22, 000] excess deaths across these 90 municipalities in this period, representing a 44% [95% CI: 43%, 45%] increase over the expected baseline. The sharpest increase in deaths in our sample was observed in late April 2021, with an estimated 678% [95% CI: 649%, 707%] increase in mortality from expected counts. The 40 to 65 age group experienced the highest increase in mortality relative to the other age groups. We found substantial increases in mortality for males and females. Our excess mortality estimate for these 90 municipalities, representing approximately at least 8% of the population, based on the 2011 census, exceeds the official COVID-19 death count for the entire state of Gujarat, even before the delta wave of the pandemic in India peaked in May 2021. Prior studies have concluded that true pandemic-related mortality in India greatly exceeds official counts. This study, using data directly from the first point of official death registration data recording, provides incontrovertible evidence of the high excess mortality in Gujarat from March 2020 to April 2021.","1510":"The majority of blindness worldwide could be prevented or reversed with early diagnosis and treatment, yet identifying at-risk and prevalent cases of eye disease and linking them with care remain important obstacles to addressing this burden. Leading causes of blindness like glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration have detectable early asymptomatic phases and can cause irreversible vision loss. Mass screening for such diseases could reduce visual impairment at the population level.NCT03752840.This protocol describes a parallel-group cluster-randomised trial designed to determine whether community-based screening for glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration reduces population-level visual impairment in Nepal. A door-to-door population census is conducted in all study communities. All adults aged \u226560 years have visual acuity tested at the census visit, and those meeting referral criteria are referred to a local eye care facility for further diagnosis and management. Communities are subsequently randomised to a community-based screening programme or to no additional intervention. The intervention consists of a single round of screening including intraocular pressure and optical coherence tomography assessment of all adults \u226560 years old with enhanced linkage to care for participants meeting referral criteria. Four years after implementation of the intervention, masked outcome assessors conduct a repeat census to collect data on the primary outcome, visual acuity. Individuals with incident visual impairment receive a comprehensive ophthalmological examination to determine the cause of visual impairment. Outcomes are compared by treatment arm according to the originally assigned intervention.The trial has received ethical approval from the University of California San Francisco Institutional Review Board, Nepal Netra Jyoti Sangh and the Nepal Health Research Council. Results of this trial will be disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentation at local and international meetings.","1511":"Psychosocial factors exert synergistic impacts on PrEP engagement among MSM. Tailored interventions addressing these subtleties may effectively optimize PrEP uptake and improve consistency of use among MSM.Data from the 2018 and 2019 American Men's Internet Survey cycles, involving 6907 adult MSM eligible for PrEP, were analyzed. We assessed sexual stigma heterogeneity among this group using latent class analysis and investigated individual relationships between i) stigma class membership, ii) mental distress, and PrEP engagement (past-year use, adherence, and persistence) using Poisson regression with a robust error variance, considering potential variations based on poverty status. The combined associations of sexual stigma and mental distress with PrEP engagement was evaluated using inverse probability weighting.Sexual stigma, mental health disorders, and socioeconomic disparities present important yet incompletely understood barriers to PrEP adoption among gay men and other men who have sex with men (MSM). This study examines how these factors interact and affect PrEP uptake, adherence, and persistence among MSM.Four distinct sexual stigma classes were identified, each exhibiting varied associations with PrEP engagement. Associations with mental distress lost statistical significance after adjusting for confounders. However, having both mental distress and sexual stigma was associated with lower past-year PrEP use, with the strongest association observed for those with anticipated healthcare stigma class membership and mental distress (aPR 0.53 [95% CI: 0.37, 0.76]). Sexual stigma accompanied by mental distress was also associated with significantly increased poor PrEP adherence, particularly among those with family and general social stigma class membership (aPR 2.31 [95% CI: 1.08, 4.97]).","1512":"We conducted a systematic literature review to identify all available epidemiological data on varicella IgG antibody seroprevalence, primary care and hospitalisation incidence, and mortality. We then developed methods to estimate age-specific varicella incidence and annual number of cases by different levels of severity (cases in the community, health care seekers in primary care and hospitals, and deaths) for all countries belonging to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) region and Switzerland.In the absence of universal varicella immunization, the burden of varicella would be substantial with a total of 5.5 million (95% CI: 4.7-6.4) varicella cases occurring annually across Europe. Variation exists between countries but overall the majority of cases (3 million; 95% CI: 2.7-3.3) would occur in children <5\u00a0years. Annually, 3-3.9 million patients would consult a primary care physician, 18,200-23,500 patients would be hospitalised, and 80 varicella-related deaths would occur (95% CI: 19-822).Varicella is generally considered a mild disease. Disease burden is not well known and country-level estimation is challenging. As varicella disease is not notifiable, notification criteria and rates vary between countries. In general, existing surveillance systems do not capture cases that do not seek medical care, and most are affected by underreporting and underascertainment. We aimed to estimate the overall varicella disease burden in Europe to provide critical information to support decision-making regarding varicella vaccination.Varicella disease burden is substantial. Most cases occur in children <5\u00a0years old but adults require hospitalisation more often and are at higher risk of death. This information should be considered when planning and evaluating varicella control strategies. A better understanding of the driving factors of country-specific differences in varicella transmission and health care utilization is needed. Improving and standardizing varicella surveillance in Europe, as initiated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), is important to improve data quality to facilitate inter-country comparison.","1513":"Fitness landscapes map the relationship between genotypes and fitness. However, most fitness landscape studies ignore the genetic architecture imposed by the codon table and thereby neglect the potential role of synonymous mutations. To quantify the fitness effects of synonymous mutations and their potential impact on adaptation on a fitness landscape, we use a new software based on Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods and re-estimate selection coefficients of all possible codon mutations across 9 amino acid positions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp90 across 6 environments. We quantify the distribution of fitness effects of synonymous mutations and show that it is dominated by many mutations of small or no effect and few mutations of larger effect. We then compare the shape of the codon fitness landscape across amino acid positions and environments, and quantify how the consideration of synonymous fitness effects changes the evolutionary dynamics on these fitness landscapes. Together these results highlight a possible role of synonymous mutations in adaptation and indicate the potential mis-inference when they are neglected in fitness landscape studies.","1514":" will maximize human health outcomes.","1515":"The retrospective method underestimates mean degree for MSM in surveys with truncated partnership data, especially for casual partnerships. The current method is less prone to bias from partner truncation when the target population has high rate of partners per year.We used data from ARTnet, a cross-sectional survey of MSM in the U.S. (2017-2019). ARTnet collected data on the number and types of sexual partners in the past year, limited to the 5 most recent partners (data truncation). We quantified partnerships for months 0-12 prior to the survey date (retrospective method), and compared that to ongoing partnerships on the day of survey (current method). We used linear regression to understand the impact of truncated partnership data on mean degree estimation.Mean active degree is an important proxy measure of cross-sectional network connectivity commonly used in HIV\/STI epidemiology research. No current studies have compared measurement methods of mean degree using a cross-sectional study design for men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States. We compared mean degree estimates based on reported ongoing main and casual sexual partnerships (current method) against dates of first and last sex (retrospective method).The retrospective method yielded similar degree estimates to the current for months proximate to the day of survey. The retrospective method mean degree systematically decreased as the month increased from 0-12 months prior to survey date. This was driven by data truncation: among participants with >5 partners in the past year compared to those with \u22645, the average change in main partnership degree between 12 and 0 months prior to survey date was -0.05 (95% CI: -0.08, -0.03) after adjusting for race\/ethnicity, age, and education. The adjusted average change in casual partnership degree was -0.40 (95% CI: -0.45, -0.35).","1516":"Rodentia is the most speciose order of mammals, and they are known to harbor a wide range of viruses. Although there has been significant research on zoonotic viruses in rodents, research on the diversity of other viruses has been limited, especially for rodents in the families Cricetidae and Heteromyidae. In fecal and liver samples of nine species of rodents, we identify 346 distinct circular DNA viral genomes. Of these, a large portion are circular, single-stranded DNA viruses in the families Anelloviridae (n\u00a0=\u00a03), Circoviridae (n\u00a0=\u00a05), Genomoviridae (n\u00a0=\u00a07), Microviridae (n\u00a0=\u00a0297), Naryaviridae (n\u00a0=\u00a04), Vilyaviridae (n\u00a0=\u00a015) and in the phylum Cressdnaviricota (n\u00a0=\u00a013) that cannot be assigned established families. We also identified two large bacteriophages of 36 and 50\u00a0kb that are part of the class Caudoviricetes. Some of these viruses are clearly those that infect rodents, however, most of these likely infect various organisms associated with rodents, their environment or their diet.","1517":"We estimate a much higher incidence of chikungunya in Dhaka than suggested by official case counts. Vector abundance, local demographics, and population mobility were associated with spatial heterogeneities in incidence in Dhaka. The peak of the outbreak in Dhaka coincided with the annual Eid holidays, during which large numbers of people traveled from Dhaka to other parts of the country. We show that travel during Eid likely resulted in the spread of the infection to the rest of the country.Several large outbreaks of chikungunya have been reported in the Indian Ocean region in the last decade. In 2017, an outbreak occurred in Dhaka, Bangladesh, one of the largest and densest megacities in the world. Population mobility and fluctuations in population density are important drivers of epidemics. Measuring population mobility during outbreaks is challenging but is a particularly important goal in the context of rapidly growing and highly connected cities in low- and middle-income countries, which can act to amplify and spread local epidemics nationally and internationally.Our results highlight the impact of large-scale population movements, for example during holidays, on the spread of infectious diseases. These dynamics are difficult to capture using traditional approaches, and we compare our results to a standard diffusion model, to highlight the value of real-time data from mobile phones for outbreak analysis, forecasting, and surveillance.We first describe the epidemiology of the 2017 chikungunya outbreak in Dhaka and estimate incidence using a mechanistic model of chikungunya transmission parametrized with epidemiological data from a household survey. We combine the modeled dynamics of chikungunya in Dhaka, with mobility estimates derived from mobile phone data for over 4 million subscribers, to understand the role of population mobility on the spatial spread of chikungunya within and outside Dhaka during the 2017 outbreak.","1518":"As of March 31, 2020, the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic that started in China in December 2019 is now generating local transmission around the world. The geographic heterogeneity and associated intervention strategies highlight the need to monitor in real time the transmission potential of COVID-19. Singapore provides a unique case example for monitoring transmission, as there have been multiple disease clusters, yet transmission remains relatively continued.The local incidence curve displays sub-exponential growth dynamics, with the reproduction number following a declining trend and reaching an estimate at 0.7 (95% CI 0.3, 1.0) during the first transmission wave by February 14, 2020, while the overall R based on the cluster size distribution as of March 17, 2020, was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI 0.4, 1.02). The overall mean reporting delay was estimated at 6.4\u2009days (95% CI 5.8, 6.9), but it was shorter among imported cases compared to local cases (mean 4.3 vs. 7.6\u2009days, Wilcoxon test, p\u2009<\u20090.001).The trajectory of the reproduction number in Singapore underscores the significant effects of successful containment efforts in Singapore, but it also suggests the need to sustain social distancing and active case finding efforts to stomp out all active chains of transmission., of COVID-19 in Singapore from the publicly available daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset, after adjusting the local cases for reporting delays as of March 17, 2020. We also derive the reproduction number from the distribution of cluster sizes using a branching process analysis that accounts for truncation of case counts.","1519":"Random effect models for time-to-event data, also known as frailty models, provide a conceptually appealing way of quantifying association between survival times and of representing heterogeneities resulting from factors which may be difficult or impossible to measure. In the literature, the random effect is usually assumed to have a continuous distribution. However, in some areas of application, discrete frailty distributions may be more appropriate. The present paper is about the implementation and interpretation of the Addams family of discrete frailty distributions. We propose methods of estimation for this family of densities in the context of shared frailty models for the hazard rates for case I interval-censored data. Our optimization framework allows for stratification of random effect distributions by covariates. We highlight interpretational advantages of the Addams family of discrete frailty distributions and theK-point distribution as compared to other frailty distributions. A unique feature of the Addams family and the K-point distribution is that the support of the frailty distribution depends on its parameters. This feature is best exploited by imposing a model on the distributional parameters, resulting in a model with non-homogeneous covariate effects that can be analyzed using standard measures such as the hazard ratio. Our methods are illustrated with applications to multivariate case I interval-censored infection data.","1520":"Total direct and indirect costs per IPD case were US$186,791 in Black populations and US$182,689 in non-Black populations; total hospitalized NBP costs per case were US$100,632 (Black) and US$96,781 (non-Black). The difference in population per-person total pneumococcal disease costs between Black and non-Black adults was US$47.85. Combined societal costs of disparities for IPD and hospitalized NBP totaled US$673.2 million for Black adults aged \u2265 \u00a050 years. Disease and disability risks, life expectancy, and case-fatality rates were influential in one-way sensitivity analyses, but the lowest cost across all analyses was US$194 million. The 95% probability range of racial disparity costs were US$227.2-US$1156.9 million in a probabilistic sensitivity analysis.In a model-based analysis, societal costs of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and hospitalized nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia (NBP) were estimated using (1) direct medical costs plus indirect costs of acute illness; (2) indirect costs of pneumococcal mortality; and (3) direct and indirect costs of related disability. Disparities costs were calculated as differences in average per-person pneumococcal disease cost between Black and non-Black adults aged \u2265 \u00a050 years multiplied by the Black population aged \u2265 \u00a050 years. Costs were in 2019 US dollars (US$), with future costs discounted at 3% per year.US societal cost of racial pneumococcal disease disparities in persons aged \u2265 50\u00a0years is substantial. Successful pneumococcal vaccination policy and programmatic interventions to mitigate these disparities could decrease costs and improve health.This study aimed to estimate the societal cost of racial disparities in pneumococcal disease among US adults aged \u2265 \u00a050 years.","1521":"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a global health care problem as we lack sufficient curative treatment options. Elucidating the dynamics of HBV infection and treatment response at the molecular level could facilitate the development of novel, more effective HBV antivirals. Currently, the only well-established small animal HBV infection model available is the chimeric uPA\/SCID mice with humanized livers; however, the HBV inhibition kinetics under pegylated interferon-\u03b1 (pegIFN) in this model system have not been determined in sufficient detail. In this study, viral kinetics in 39 humanized mice treated with pegIFN and\/or lamivudine were monitored and analyzed using a mathematical-modelling approach. We found that the main mode of action of interferon-\u03b1 is blocking HBV DNA synthesis and that the majority of synthesized HBV DNA is secreted. Our study provides novel insights into HBV DNA dynamics within infected human hepatocytes.","1522":"Tissue Forge is an open-source interactive environment for particle-based physics, chemistry and biology modeling and simulation.

The finding that women had a greater likelihood of severe forms of TB and TB-HIV coinfection compared to men has important implications for women's health in TB-HIV high-burden settings. = 41, 266) diagnosed in Harare, Zimbabwe. This cross-sectional study estimated male-to-female ratio (M\/F ratio) for (1) age-specific TB incidence, (2) age-specific HIV prevalence among incident TB cases, and (3) 9 types of TB defined by affected anatomic site.Males were at a 53% higher risk of TB compared to females (risk ratio [RR] = 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-2.09). Based on adjusted odds ratios (aORs) from multinomial logistic regression model, the odds of abdominal TB (aOR = 0.51; 95% CI, .39-.68), TB bones\/joints\/spine (aOR = 0.63; 95% CI, .45-.90), and \"other\" extrapulmonary TB sites (aOR = 0.69; 95% CI = .59-.81) versus pulmonary TB were lower among males compared to females. The risk of TB-HIV coinfection among males was 17% (RR = .83; 95% CI, .74-.93) and 8% (RR = 0.92; 95% CI, .88-.95) lower in the 15- to 24-year and 25- to 44-year age groups, respectively.Previous studies have shown gender differences in tuberculosis (TB) incidence; however, gender disparity has not been well documented across granular categorizations of anatomic sites affected by TB and in the presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection, largely due to small sample size for less common TB clinical presentations and lack of detailed clinical data.","1524":"Michigan experienced a significant measles outbreak in 2019 amidst rising rates of non-medical vaccine exemptions (NMEs) and low vaccination coverage compared with the rest of the United States. There is a critical need to better understand the landscape of non-vaccination in Michigan to assess the risk of vaccine-preventable outbreaks in the state, yet there is no agreed-upon best practice for characterizing spatial clustering of non-vaccination, and numerous clustering metrics are available in the statistical, geographic, and epidemiologic literature. We used school-level NME data to characterize the spatiotemporal landscape of vaccine exemptions in Michigan from 2008-2018 using Moran's I, the Isolation Index, Modified Aggregation Index, and the Theil Index at four spatial scales. We also used thresholds of 5%, 10%, and 20% non-vaccination to assess the bias incurred when aggregating vaccination data. We found that aggregating school-level data to levels commonly used for public reporting can lead to large biases in identifying the number and location of at-risk students, and that different clustering metrics yielded variable interpretations of the non-vaccination landscape in Michigan. This paper shows the importance of choosing clustering metrics with their mechanistic interpretations in mind: be it large- or fine-scale heterogeneity, or between-and-within group contributions to spatial variation.","1525":"COVID-19 dynamics are driven by a complex interplay of factors including population behaviour, new variants, vaccination and immunity from prior infections. We quantify drivers of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the Dominican Republic, an upper-middle income country of 10.8 million people. We then assess the impact of the vaccination campaign implemented in February 2021, primarily using CoronaVac, in saving lives and averting hospitalisations.We fit an age-structured, multi-variant transmission dynamic model to reported deaths, hospital bed occupancy, and seroprevalence data until December 2021, and simulate epidemic trajectories under different counterfactual scenarios.SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in the Dominican Republic were driven by a substantial accumulation of immunity during the first two years of the pandemic but, despite this, vaccination was essential in enabling a return to pre-pandemic mobility levels without considerable additional morbidity and mortality.Medical Research Council, Wellcome Trust, Royal Society, US CDC and Australian National Health and Medical Research Council.We estimate that vaccination averted 7210 hospital admissions (95% credible interval, CrI: 6830-7600), 2180 intensive care unit admissions (95% CrI: 2080-2280) and 766 deaths (95% CrI: 694-859) in the first 6 months of the campaign. If no vaccination had occurred, we estimate that an additional decrease of 10-20% in population mobility would have been required to maintain equivalent death and hospitalisation outcomes. We also found that early vaccination with CoronaVac was preferable to delayed vaccination using a product with higher efficacy.","1526":"Planthoppers are the most notorious rice pests, because they transmit various rice viruses in a persistent-propagative manner. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between virus and vector are crucial for virus transmission by vector insects. However, the number of known PPIs for pairs of rice viruses and planthoppers is restricted by low throughput research methods. In this study, we applied DeNovo, a virus-host sequence-based PPI predictor, to predict potential PPIs at a genome-wide scale between three planthoppers and five rice viruses. PPIs were identified at two different confidence thresholds, referred to as low and high modes. The number of PPIs for the five planthopper-virus pairs ranged from 506 to 1985 in the low mode and from 1254 to 4286 in the high mode. After eliminating the \"one-too-many\" redundant interacting information, the PPIs with unique planthopper proteins were reduced to 343-724 in the low mode and 758-1671 in the high mode. Homologous analysis showed that 11 sets and 31 sets of homologous planthopper proteins were shared by all planthopper-virus interactions in the two modes, indicating that they are potential conserved vector factors essential for transmission of rice viruses. Ten PPIs between small brown planthopper and rice stripe virus (RSV) were verified using glutathione-S-transferase (GST)\/His-pull down or co-immunoprecipitation assay. Five of the ten PPIs were proven positive, and three of the five SBPH proteins were confirmed to interact with RSV. The predicted PPIs provide new clues for further studies of the complicated relationship between rice viruses and their vector insects.","1527":"There is growing attention and evidence that healthcare AI is vulnerable to racial bias. Despite the renewed attention to racism in the United States, racism is often disconnected from the literature on ethical AI. Addressing racism as an ethical issue will facilitate the development of trustworthy and responsible healthcare AI.","1528":"Evidence and advice for pregnant women evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic. We studied social contact behaviour and vaccine uptake in pregnant women between March 2020 and September 2021 in 19 European countries.Limited social contact to avoid pathogen exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge to many, especially women going through pregnancy. More recognition of maternal social support desire is needed in the ongoing pandemic. As COVID-19 vaccination continues to remain an important pillar of outbreak response, strategies to promote correct information can provide reassurance and facilitate informed pregnancy vaccine decisions in this vulnerable group.We recorded 4,129 observations from 1,041 pregnant women, and 115,359 observations from 29,860 non-pregnant individuals aged 18-49. Pregnant women made slightly fewer contacts (3.6, 95%CI\u2009=\u20093.5-3.7) than non-pregnant women (4.0, 95%CI\u2009=\u20093.9-4.0), driven by fewer work contacts but marginally more contacts in non-essential social settings. Approximately 15-20% pregnant and 5% of non-pregnant individuals reported to be in isolation and quarantine for large parts of the study period. COVID-19 vaccine coverage was higher in pregnant women than in non-pregnant women between January and April 2021. Since May 2021, vaccination in non-pregnant women began to increase and surpassed that in pregnant women.In each country, repeated online survey data were collected from a panel of nationally-representative participants. We calculated the adjusted mean number of contacts reported with an individual-level generalized additive mixed model, modelled using the negative binomial distribution and a log link function. Mean proportion of people in isolation or quarantine, and vaccination coverage by pregnancy status and gender were calculated using a clustered bootstrap.","1529":"Data are limited regarding long-term consequences of invasive GBS (iGBS) disease in early infancy, especially from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) where most cases occur. We aimed to estimate risk of neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) in children with a history of iGBS disease.Amongst 138 iGBS survivors and 390 non-iGBS children, 38\u00b71% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 30\u00b70% - 46\u00b76%) of iGBS children had any NDI, compared to 21\u00b77% (95% CI: 17\u00b77% - 26\u00b70%) of non- iGBS children, with notable between-site heterogeneity. Risk of moderate\/severe NDI was 15\u00b70% (95% CI: 3\u00b74% - 30\u00b78%) among GBS-meningitis, 5\u00b76% (95% CI: 1\u00b75% - 13\u00b77%) for GBS-sepsis survivors. The adjusted risk ratio (aRR) for moderate\/severe NDI among iGBS survivors was 1.27 (95% CI: 0.65, 2.45), when compared to non-GBS children. Mild impairment was more frequent in iGBS (27.6% (95% CI: 20.3 - 35.5%)) compared to non-GBS children (12.9% (95% CI: 9.7% - 16.4%)). The risk of emotional-behavioural problems was similar irrespective of iGBS exposure (aRR=0.98 (95% CI: 0.55, 1.77)).This work was supported by a grant (INV-009018) from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to the London School of Hygiene &Tropical Medicine.A multi-country matched cohort study was undertaken in South Africa, India, Mozambique, Kenya, and Argentina from October 2019 to April 2021. The exposure of interest was defined as a history of iGBS disease (sepsis or meningitis) before 90 days of age, amongst children now aged 1\u00b75-18 years. Age and sex-matched, children without history of GBS were also recruited. Age-appropriate, culturally-adapted assessments were used to define NDI across multiple domains (cognitive, motor, hearing, vision, emotional-behaviour, growth). Pooled NDI risk was meta-analysed across sites. Association of iGBS exposure and NDI outcome was estimated using modified Poisson regression with robust variance estimator.Our findings suggest that iGBS disease is on average associated with a higher risk of moderate\/severe NDI, however substantial variation in risk was observed between sites and data are consistent with a wide range of values. Our study underlines the importance of long-term follow-up for at-risk neonates and more feasible, standardised assessments to facilitate diagnosis in research and clinical practice.","1530":"In many social and biological networks, the collective dynamics of the entire system can be shaped by a small set of influential units through a global cascading process, manifested by an abrupt first-order transition in dynamical behaviors. Despite its importance in applications, efficient identification of multiple influential spreaders in cascading processes still remains a challenging task for large-scale networks. Here we address this issue by exploring the collective influence in general threshold models of cascading process. Our analysis reveals that the importance of spreaders is fixed by the subcritical paths along which cascades propagate: the number of subcritical paths attached to each spreader determines its contribution to global cascades. The concept of subcritical path allows us to introduce a scalable algorithm for massively large-scale networks. Results in both synthetic random graphs and real networks show that the proposed method can achieve larger collective influence given the same number of seeds compared with other scalable heuristic approaches.","1531":"Multiplicity of infection (MOI), the number of unique Plasmodium falciparum parasite genotypes found in one infected individual, may contribute to the development of clinical malaria disease. However, the independent contribution of MOI and parasite density to clinical disease has not been well characterized. We conducted a two-year longitudinal cohort study of adults and children in a high-transmission setting in Malawi to test the hypothesis that increased MOI was independently associated with clinical disease, after accounting for parasite density. Of 1,062 episodes of infection, 477 (44.9%) were associated with symptoms. After controlling for repeated measures within an individual, key demographic factors, and parasite density, there was no association between MOI and clinical disease (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.70-1.51). Although the limited ability to discern MOI in low-density asymptomatic infections may have impacted our results, we conclude that MOI is not an independent risk factor for clinical disease.","1532":"EBB is a strong tool to achieve efficient allocation of resources, but in SSA the evidence necessary for USDB populations may be lacking. Rather than excluding USDB populations from the budgeting process, more should be invested in understanding the needs of these populations.To be considered in an EBB cycle, an intervention needs at a minimum to have an estimate of a) the average cost, typically per recipient of the intervention; b) the effectiveness of the intervention and c) the size of the intervention target population. The methods commonly used for general populations are not sufficient for generating valid estimates for USDB populations. USDB populations may require additional resources to learn about, access, and\/or successfully participate in an intervention, increasing the cost per recipient. USDB populations may experience different health outcomes and\/or other benefits than in general populations, influencing the effectiveness of the interventions. Finally, USDB population size estimation is critical for accurate programming but is difficult to obtain with almost no national estimates for countries in SSA. We explain these limitations and make recommendations for addressing them.In recent years, many countries have\u00a0adopted evidence-based budgeting (EBB) to encourage the best use of limited and decreasing HIV resources.\u00a0The lack of data and evidence for hard to reach, marginalized and vulnerable populations could cause EBB to further disadvantage those who are already underserved and who carry a disproportionate HIV burden (USDB). We outline the critical data required to use EBB to support USDB people in the context of the generalized epidemics of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).","1533":" in the general and susceptible populations, respectively.

One critique of such programs focuses on the uncertainty around whether seropositivity means immunity from repeat infection. However, an additional important consideration is that the low positive predictive value of serological tests in the setting of low population seroprevalence and imperfect test specificity will lead to many false-positive 'passport' holders. Here, we pose a simple question: how many false-positive 'passports' could be issued while maintaining herd immunity in the workforce? Answering this question leads to a simple mathematical formula for the minimum requirements of serological tests for a passport program, which depend on population prevalence and the value of R0. Our work replaces speculation in the press with rigorous analysis and will need to be considered in policy decisions that are based on individual and population serology results.","1535":"In this modelling study, we compared four strategies: no vaccination, routine immunisation at 9 months, and routine immunisation at 9 months with catch-up campaigns to either age 5 years or 15 years. For each of the 54 countries eligible for Gavi support, output from an age-structured transmission-dynamic model was combined with country-specific treatment and vaccine-related costs, treatment outcomes, and disability weights to estimate the reduction in typhoid burden, identify the strategy that maximised average net benefit (ie, the optimal strategy) across a range of country-specific willingness-to-pay (WTP) values, estimate and investigate the uncertainties surrounding our findings, and identify the epidemiological conditions under which vaccination is optimal.Countries should establish their own WTP threshold and consider routine TCV introduction, including a catch-up campaign when vaccination is optimal on the basis of this threshold. Obtaining improved estimates of the probability of hospital admission would be valuable whenever the optimal strategy is uncertain.Typhoid fever is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in low-income and middle-income countries. In 2017, WHO recommended the programmatic use of typhoid Vi-conjugate vaccine (TCV) in endemic settings, and Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, has pledged support for vaccine introduction in these countries. Country-level health economic evaluations are now needed to inform decision-making.The optimal strategy was either no vaccination or TCV immunisation including a catch-up campaign. Routine vaccination with a catch-up campaign to 15 years of age was optimal in 38 countries, assuming a WTP value of at least US$200 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted, or assuming a WTP value of at least 25% of each country's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita per DALY averted, at a vaccine price of $1\u00b750 per dose (but excluding Gavi's contribution according to each country's transition phase). This vaccination strategy was also optimal in 48 countries assuming a WTP of at least $500 per DALY averted, in 51 with assumed WTP values of at least $1000, in 47 countries assuming a WTP value of at least 50% of GDP per capita per DALY averted, and in 49 assuming a minimum of 100%. Vaccination was likely to be cost-effective in countries with 300 or more typhoid cases per 100\u2008000 person-years.

However, their respective etiologies are unclear and challenging to diagnose. We report the first case of severe falciparum malaria followed by prolonged haemolytic anaemia and rhinomaxillary mucormycosis in a previously healthy adult male.\r\n\r\nCase presentation\r\nA 30-year old Bangladeshi man was admitted with severe falciparum malaria complicated by hyperlactataemia and haemoglobinuria. Prior to admission he was treated with intravenous quinine and upon admission received intravenous artesunate and empiric ceftriaxone. Thirty hours later the peripheral parasitaemia cleared with resolution of fever and haemoglobinuria. Despite parasite clearance, on day 3 the patient developed recurrent fever and acute haemolytic anaemia requiring seven blood transfusions over six days with no improvement of his haemoglobin or haemoglobinuria. On day 10, he was treated with high-dose dexamethasone and meropenem with discontinuation of the ceftriaxone. Two days later the haemoglobinuria resolved. Ceftriaxone-induced haemolysis was the suspected final diagnosis. On day 16, the patient had progressively worsening right-sided facial pain and swelling; a necrotic ulceration of the hard palate was observed. Rhinomaxillary mucormycosis was diagnosed supported by microscopy findings. The patient initially responded to treatment with urgent surgical debridement, itraconazole, followed by two weeks of amphotericin B deoxycholate, however was subsequently lost to follow up.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nThis case highlights the range of potential alternative aetiologies of acute, prolonged haemolysis and recurrent fever following parasite clearance in severe falciparum malaria. It emphasizes the importance of a high degree of suspicion for alternative causes of haemolysis in order to avoid unnecessary treatments, including blood transfusion and steroids. It is critical to consider and identify common invasive bacterial and rare opportunistic co-infections as a cause of fever in severe malaria patients remaining febrile after parasite clearance to promote antimicrobial stewardship and prompt emergency care.","1537":"An impressive number of COVID-19 data catalogs exist. However, none are fully optimized for data science applications. Inconsistent naming and data conventions, uneven quality control, and lack of alignment between disease data and potential predictors pose barriers to robust modeling and analysis. To address this gap, we generated a unified dataset that integrates and implements quality checks of the data from numerous leading sources of COVID-19 epidemiological and environmental data. We use a globally consistent hierarchy of administrative units to facilitate analysis within and across countries. The dataset applies this unified hierarchy to align COVID-19 epidemiological data with a number of other data types relevant to understanding and predicting COVID-19 risk, including hydrometeorological data, air quality, information on COVID-19 control policies, vaccine data, and key demographic characteristics.","1538":"Chronic immune activation and viral latency are among the main factors behind the persistence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and other viral diseases. Immune activation is chiefly lead by dendritic cells which detect the presence of Virus (HIV) and notify other immune cells particularly the helper T cells via the process called antigen presentation. However, antigen presentation process increases the chances of T cells to be infected by the viral particles trapped by dendritic cells. In this paper, a time-fractional diffusion model is proposed to investigate the impact of dendritic cells on the spread of HIV among susceptible T cells with respect to time and anomalous diffusion posed by cells crowding. The equilibrium points of the model are obtained and analysed. The disease free steady state proved to be stable both in spatially homogeneous case and in the presence diffusion and chemotaxis. The endemic steady state is stable in the absence of diffusion and chemotaxis, however the presence of diffusion induces instability if a thresshold value is exceeded. A priori estimates were also obtained in the appropriate Sobolev spaces. Furthermore, the numerical experiments were conducted to examine the dynamic behaviour of cells densities with respect to time and the sub-diffusion parameter.","1539":" The focus on Black MSM in the N2 Study will allow for a nuanced exploration of the attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, and practices of a diverse group of Black MSM.

A health equity framework ensures that Black MSM are not explicitly or implicitly deemed as deviant, disordered, or the non-reference group. Findings from N2 will provide guidance for the implementation of more impactful HIV prevention interventions that engage a diverse population of Black MSM as we work toward HIV elimination in the U.S.","1540":"In this study, we construct a within-host mathematical model of HCV\/HIV coinfection by adapting a previously published model of HCV monoinfection to include an immune system component in infection clearance. We explore the effect of HIV-coinfection on spontaneous HCV clearance and sustained virologic response (SVR) by building in decreased immune function with increased HIV viral load. Treatment is modeled by modifying HCV burst-size, and we use clinically-relevant parameter estimates. Our model replicates real-world patient outcomes; it outputs infected and uninfected target cell counts, and HCV viral load for varying treatment and coinfection scenarios. Increased HIV viral load and reduced CD4(+) count correlate with decreased spontaneous clearance and SVR chances. Treatment efficacy\/duration combinations resulting in SVR are calculated for HIV-positive and negative patients, and crucially, we replicate the new findings that highly efficacious DAAs reduce treatment differences between HIV-positive and negative patients. However, we also find that if drug efficacy decays sufficiently over treatment course, SVR differences between HIV-positive and negative patients reappear.HIV\/hepatitis C (HCV) coinfection is a major concern in global health today. Each pathogen can exacerbate the effects of the other and affect treatment outcomes. Understanding the within-host dynamics of these coinfecting pathogens is crucial, particularly in light of new, direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for HCV treatment that are becoming available.Our model shows theoretical evidence of the differing outcomes of HCV infection in cases where the immune system is compromised by HIV. Understanding what controls these outcomes is especially important with the advent of efficacious but often prohibitively expensive DAAs. Using a model to predict patient response can lend insight into optimal treatment design, both in helping to identify patients who might respond well to treatment and in helping to identify treatment pathways and pitfalls.","1541":"We and others have previously shown that genetic association can be used to make causal connections between gene loci and small molecules measured by mass spectrometry in the bloodstream and in tissues. We identified a locus on mouse chromosome 7 where several phospholipids in liver showed strong genetic association to distinct gene loci. In this study, we integrated gene expression data with genetic association data to identify a single gene at the chromosome 7 locus as the driver of the phospholipid phenotypes. The gene encodes \u03b1\/\u03b2-hydrolase domain 2 (Abhd2), one of 23 members of the ABHD gene family. We validated this observation by measuring lipids in a mouse with a whole-body deletion of Abhd2. The Abhd2KO mice had a significant increase in liver levels of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Unexpectedly, we also found a decrease in two key mitochondrial lipids, cardiolipin and phosphatidylglycerol, in male Abhd2KO mice. These data suggest that Abhd2 plays a role in the synthesis, turnover, or remodeling of liver phospholipids.","1542":"Despite the major impact of mosquitoes on human health, knowledge gaps exist regarding their natural population dynamics. Even the most basic information-such as spatiotemporal abundance-is mostly unavailable. In the USA, municipalities have created agencies for mosquito control and monitoring, yet no national open-access repository for mosquito surveillance data exists. Vectors, and the pathogens they transmit, know no jurisdictions. We identify >1,000 mosquito control agencies and identify those which make their population abundance surveillance data publicly available. We directly survey Floridian mosquito districts to estimate, from one state alone, the potential amount of hidden data. We generate a large, standardized data set from publicly available online data and demonstrate that spatiotemporal population abundance can be reconstructed and analyzed across data generators. We propose that the ensemble of US mosquito control agencies can, and should, be used to develop a national-and potentially international-open-access repository of mosquito surveillance data, generating the data capital needed to gain a mechanistic understanding of vector population dynamics, and identify existing digital infrastructure that could be leveraged for digitizing and collating extant and future surveillance data for such a repository.","1543":"We analyzed antiviral prescription and clinical data for high-risk outpatients aged \u22656 months with an acute respiratory illness (ARI) and enrolled in the US Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network during the 2011-2012 through 2015-2016 influenza seasons. We obtained clinical information from interviews and electronic medical records and tested all enrollees for influenza with real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). We calculated the number of patients with ARI that must be treated to treat 1 patient with influenza.Influenza antiviral medications were infrequently prescribed for high-risk outpatients with ARI who would benefit most. Efforts to increase appropriate antiviral prescribing are needed to reduce influenza-associated complications.Among high-risk outpatients with ARI who presented to care within 2 days of symptom onset (early), 15% (718\/4861) were prescribed an antiviral medication, including 472 of 1292 (37%) of those with rRT-PCR-confirmed influenza. Forty percent of high-risk outpatients with influenza presented to care early. Earlier presentation was associated with antiviral treatment (odds ratio [OR], 4.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5-4.8), as was fever (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.7-3.8), although 25% of high-risk outpatients with influenza were afebrile. Empiric treatment of 4 high-risk outpatients with ARI was needed to treat 1 patient with influenza.Influenza causes millions of illnesses annually; certain groups are at higher risk for complications. Early antiviral treatment can reduce the risk of complications and is recommended for outpatients at increased risk. We describe antiviral prescribing among high-risk outpatients for 5 influenza seasons and explore factors that may influence prescribing.","1544":"Neonatal invasive disease caused by Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is responsible for much acute mortality and long-term morbidity. To guide development of better prevention strategies, including maternal vaccines that protect neonates against GBS, it is necessary to estimate the burden of this condition globally and in different regions. Here, we present a Bayesian model that estimates country-specific invasive GBS (iGBS) disease incidence in children aged 0 to 6 days. The model combines different types of epidemiological data, each of which has its own limitations: GBS colonization prevalence in pregnant women, risk of iGBS disease in children born to GBS-colonized mothers and direct estimates of iGBS disease incidence where available. In our analysis, we present country-specific maternal GBS colonization prevalence after adjustment for GBS detection assay used in epidemiological studies. We then integrate these results with other epidemiological data and estimate country-level incidence of iGBS disease including in countries with no studies that directly estimate incidence. We are able to simultaneously estimate two key epidemiological quantities: the country-specific incidence of early-onset iGBS disease, and the risk of iGBS disease in babies born to GBS-colonized women. Overall, we believe our method will contribute to a more comprehensive quantification of the global burden of this disease, inform cost-effectiveness assessments of potential maternal GBS vaccines and identify key areas where data are necessary.","1545":"The degree to which artificial intelligence healthcare research is informed by data and stakeholders from community settings has not been previously described. As communities are the principal location of healthcare delivery, engaging them could represent an important opportunity to improve scientific quality. This scoping review systematically maps what is known and unknown about community-engaged artificial intelligence research and identifies opportunities to optimize the generalizability of these applications through involvement of community stakeholders and data throughout model development, validation, and implementation. Embase, PubMed, and MEDLINE databases were searched for articles describing artificial intelligence or machine learning healthcare applications with community involvement in model development, validation, or implementation. Model architecture and performance, the nature of community engagement, and barriers or facilitators to community engagement were reported according to PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Of approximately 10,880 articles describing artificial intelligence healthcare applications, 21 (0.2%) described community involvement. All articles derived data from community settings, most commonly by leveraging existing datasets and sources that included community subjects, and often bolstered by internet-based data acquisition and subject recruitment. Only one article described inclusion of community stakeholders in designing an application-a natural language processing model that detected cases of likely child abuse with 90% accuracy using harmonized electronic health record notes from both hospital and community practice settings. The primary barrier to including community-derived data was small sample sizes, which may have affected 11 of the 21 studies (53%), introducing substantial risk for overfitting that threatens generalizability. Community engagement in artificial intelligence healthcare application development, validation, or implementation is rare. As healthcare delivery occurs primarily in community settings, investigators should consider engaging community stakeholders in user-centered design, usability, and clinical implementation studies to optimize generalizability.","1546":"Technical variation, or variation from non-biological sources, is present in most laboratory assays. Correcting for this variation enables analysts to extract a bio- logical signal that informs questions of interest. However, each assay has different sources and levels of technical variation and the choice of correction methods can impact downstream analyses. Compared to similar assays such as DNA microarrays, relatively few methods have been developed and evaluated for protein microarrays, a versatile tool for measuring levels of various proteins in serum samples. Here, we propose a pre-processing pipeline to correct for some common sources of technical variation in protein microarrays. The pipeline builds upon an existing normalization method by using controls to reduce technical variation. We evaluate our method using data from two protein microarray studies, and by simulation. We demonstrate that pre-processing choices impact the fluorescent-intensity based ranks of proteins, which in turn, impact downstream analysis. This article is protected by copyright.

A major impetus for this workshop is that climate change can affect components of ecological risks in multiple direct and indirect ways, including the use patterns and environmental exposure pathways of chemical stressors such as pesticides, the toxicity of chemicals in receiving environments, and the vulnerability of species of concern related to habitat quality and use. This paper explores a modeling approach for integrating climate model projections into the assessment of near- and long-term ecological risks, developed in collaboration with climate scientists. State-of-the-art global climate modeling and downscaling techniques may enable climate projections at scales appropriate for the study area. It is, however, also important to realize the limitations of individual global climate models and make use of climate model ensembles represented by statistical properties. Here, we present a probabilistic modeling approach aiming to combine projected climatic variables as well as the associated uncertainties from climate model ensembles in conjunction with ERA pathways. We draw upon three examples of ERA that utilized Bayesian networks for this purpose and that also represent methodological advancements for better prediction of future risks to ecosystems. We envision that the modeling approach developed from this international collaboration will contribute to better assessment and management of risks from chemical stressors in a changing climate.","1549":"School closures, while an effective measure against the spread of disease during a pandemic, may carry unintended social and economic consequences for students and families. We evaluated these costs and consequences following a 4-day school closure in Mississippi's Harrison County School District (HCSD).In a survey of all households with students enrolled in HCSD, we collected information on difficulties related to the school closure, including interruption of employment and pay, loss of access to subsidized school meals, and arrangement of alternative childcare. We analyzed this information in the context of certain demographic characteristics of the survey respondents and households, such as race, level of education, and income. We also estimated the average number of lost work days and documented the childcare alternatives chosen by households affected by the school closure.To help prevent undue financial hardship in families of school children, public health authorities and school administrators should provide recommendations for childcare alternatives and paid leave or remote work options during prolonged school closures, particularly to households in which all adults work outside of the home.We received 2,229 (28.4%) completed surveys from an estimated 7,851 households eligible to participate. About half (1,082 [48.5%]) of the households experienced at least some difficulty during the closure, primarily in three areas: uncertainty about duration of the closure, lost income, and the effort of arranging alternate childcare. Adults working outside the home, particularly the major wage earner in the household, were more likely to suffer lost income while schools were closed, an effect mitigated by paid leave benefits. Difficulty arranging childcare was reported most frequently by respondents with lower levels of education and households with younger children. Beyond the top three concerns expressed by households in HCSD, the survey also shed light on the issue of food insecurity when subsidized school meals are not available. Reported by 17.9% of households participating in the subsidized school lunch program, difficulty providing meals during the closure was associated with higher numbers of dependent children, selection of \"other\" as the race of the household respondent, and lower levels of education.","1550":"Researchers from 23 out of the 62 CTSA hubs responded to the survey. 67% of respondents across roles and topics expressed interest in learning about informatics topics. There was high interest in all 30 topics included in the survey, with some variation in interest depending on the role of the respondents.Informatics and data science skills are essential for the full spectrum of translational research, and an increased understanding of informatics issues on the part of translational researchers can alleviate the demand for informaticians and enable more productive collaborations when informaticians are involved. Identifying the level of interest in different topics among various types of of translational researchers will help set priorities for development and dissemination of informatics education.We surveyed clinical and translational science researchers in Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) programs about their educational needs and preferences.Our data support the need to advance training in clinical and biomedical informatics. As the complexity and use of information technology and data science in research studies grows, informaticians will continue to be a limited resource for research collaboration, education, and training. An increased understanding of informatics issues across translational research teams can alleviate this burden and allow for more productive collaborations. To inform a roadmap for informatics education for research professionals, we suggest strategies to use the results of this needs assessment to develop future informatics education.To identify the informatics educational needs of clinical and translational research professionals whose primary focus is not informatics.","1551":"Increasing levels of antibiotic resistance in many bacterial pathogen populations are a major threat to public health. Resistance to an antibiotic provides a fitness benefit when the bacteria are exposed to this antibiotic, but resistance also often comes at a cost to the resistant pathogen relative to susceptible counterparts. We lack a good understanding of these benefits and costs of resistance for many bacterial pathogens and antibiotics, but estimating them could lead to better use of antibiotics in a way that reduces or prevents the spread of resistance. Here, we propose a new model for the joint epidemiology of susceptible and resistant variants, which includes explicit parameters for the cost and benefit of resistance. We show how Bayesian inference can be performed under this model using phylogenetic data from susceptible and resistant lineages and that by combining data from both we are able to disentangle and estimate the resistance cost and benefit parameters separately. We applied our inferential methodology to several simulated datasets to demonstrate good scalability and accuracy. We analysed a dataset of Neisseria gonorrhoeae genomes collected between 2000 and 2013 in the USA. We found that two unrelated lineages resistant to fluoroquinolones shared similar epidemic dynamics and resistance parameters. Fluoroquinolones were abandoned for the treatment of gonorrhoea due to increasing levels of resistance, but our results suggest that they could be used to treat a minority of around 10% of cases without causing resistance to grow again.","1552":"To revisit ELCs, illustrate their benefits using a case study, and promote their adoption by providing open-source code.ELCs combine the probability that each strategy is not cost-effective on the basis of current information and the expected foregone benefits resulting from choosing that strategy (ie, how much is lost if we recommended a strategy with a higher expected loss). ELCs display how the optimal strategy switches across willingness-to-pay thresholds and enables comparison between different strategies in terms of the expected loss.ELCs provide a more comprehensive representation of uncertainty and overcome current limitations of CEACs and the CEAF. Communication of uncertainty in CEA would benefit from greater adoption of ELCs as a complementary method to CEACs, the CEAF, and the expected value of perfect information.Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) and the cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier (CEAF) are the recommended graphical representations of uncertainty in a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). Nevertheless, many limitations of CEACs and the CEAF have been recognized by others. Expected loss curves (ELCs) overcome these limitations by displaying the expected foregone benefits of choosing one strategy over others, the optimal strategy in expectation, and the value of potential future research all in a single figure.We used a probabilistic sensitivity analysis of a CEA comparing 6 cerebrospinal fluid biomarker test-and-treat strategies in patients with mild cognitive impairment. We showed how to calculate ELCs for a set of decision alternatives. We used the probabilistic sensitivity analysis of the case study to illustrate the limitations of currently recommended methods for communicating uncertainty and then demonstrated how ELCs can address these issues.","1553":"Serial screening is critical for restricting spread of SARS-CoV-2 by facilitating the timely identification of infected individuals to interrupt transmission chains. The variation in sensitivity of different diagnostic tests at different stages of infection has not been well documented.This is a longitudinal study of 43 adults newly infected with SARS-CoV-2. All participants provided daily samples for saliva and nasal swab RTqPCR, Quidel SARS Sofia antigen FIA, and live virus culture.RTqPCR tests are more effective than antigen tests at identifying infected individuals prior to or early during the infectious period and thus for minimizing forward transmission (given timely results reporting). All tests showed >98% sensitivity for identifying infected individuals if used at least every three days. Daily screening using antigen tests can achieve ~90% sensitivity for identifying infected individuals while they are viral culture positive.We show that both RTqPCR and the Quidel SARS Sofia antigen FIA peak in sensitivity during the period in which live virus is detected in nasal swabs, but the sensitivity of RTqPCR tests rises more rapidly prior to this period. We also estimate the sensitivities of RTqPCR and antigen tests as a function of testing frequency.","1554":"Offering a choice of influenza vaccine type may increase vaccine coverage and reduce disease burden, but it is more costly. This study calculated the public health impact and cost-effectiveness of 4 strategies: no choice, pediatric choice, adult choice, or choice for both age groups. Using agent-based modeling, individuals were simulated as they interacted with others, and influenza was tracked as it spread through a population in Washington, DC. Influenza vaccination coverage derived from data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was increased by 6.5% (range, 3.25%-11.25%), reflecting changes due to vaccine choice. With moderate influenza infectivity, the number of cases averaged 1,117,285 for no choice, 1,083,126 for pediatric choice, 1,009,026 for adult choice, and 975,818 for choice for both age groups. Averted cases increased with increased coverage and were highest for the choice-for-both-age-groups strategy; adult choice also reduced cases in children. In cost-effectiveness analysis, choice for both age groups was dominant when choice increased vaccine coverage by \u22653.25%. Offering a choice of influenza vaccines, with reasonable resultant increases in coverage, decreased influenza cases by >100,000 with a favorable cost-effectiveness profile. Clinical trials testing the predictions made based on these simulation results and deliberation of policies and procedures to facilitate choice should be considered.","1555":"In December 2013, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) transmission was reported for the first time in the Americas. Since then it has spread quickly, with more than 1 million suspected and confirmed cases being reported in one year, where previously there were only sporadic travel-related cases. Transmission patterns suggest that the epidemic in the southern hemisphere is only beginning and that chikungunya will not go away anytime soon. ","1556":"The aim of the present study was to estimate the economic impact of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection in Colombia from a societal perspective.Our study can help health decision makers to properly assess the burden of disease caused by CHIK in Colombia, an endemic tropical country. We recommend to strength the health information systems and to continue investing in public health measures to prevent CHIK.We conducted a retrospective, bottom-up cost-of-illness study in clinically confirmed cases during the first chikungunya (CHIK) outbreak in Colombia in 2014. Direct and indirect costs were estimated per patient. Economic costs were calculated by the addition of direct costs (direct medical costs and out-of-pocket heath expenditures) and indirect cost as a result of loss of productivity.A total of 126 patients (67 children and 59 adults) with CHIK were included. The median of the direct medical cost in children was US$257.9 (interquartile range [IQR] 121.7-563.8), and US$66.6 (IQR 26.5-317.3) for adults. The productivity loss median expenditures reached US$81.3 (IQR 72.2-203.2) per adult patient. The median economic cost in adults as a result of CHIK was US$152.9 (IQR 101.0-539.6), of which 53.2% was a result of indirect costs. Out-of-pocket expenditures comprised 3.3% of all economic costs.","1557":"Epidemiological data that consist of the date of illness onset and the date of laboratory confirmation were analysed. A functional model that captures the generation-dependent growth patterns of cases was employed, while accounting for the time delay from illness onset to diagnosis.The variance of the generation time is relatively limited compared with the mean for measles, and thus, the proposed model was able to identify the generation-dependent dynamics accurately during the early phase of the epidemic. Model comparison indicated the most likely number of generations, allowing us to assess how effective public health interventions would successfully prevent the secondary transmission.Japan experienced a multi-generation outbreak of measles from March to May, 2018. The present study aimed to capture the transmission dynamics of measles by employing a simple mathematical model, and also forecast the future incidence of cases.As long as the number of generations is correctly captured, the model yielded a valid forecast of measles cases, explicitly addressing the reporting delay. Except for the first generation, the effective reproduction number was estimated by generation, assisting evaluation of public health control programs.","1558":" approach, therefore, may complement current theoretical advances aimed at disentangling the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms shaping species interaction networks.This article is part of the themed issue 'Process and pattern in innovations from cells to societies'.","1559":"The approach demonstrated here provides a framework for identifying key traveller groups and their origins and destinations of travel in combination with knowledge of local epidemiology to inform malaria control and elimination efforts. Working with the NMEP, the findings were used to derive a set of policy recommendations to guide targeting of interventions for elimination.Most travel was in the south of the study region between Cox's Bazar district (coastal region) to forested areas in Bandarban (31% by days and 45% by nights), forming a source-sink route. Less than 1% of travel reported was between the north and south forested areas of the study area. Farmers (21%) and students (19%) were the top two occupations recorded, with 67 and 47% reporting travel to the forest respectively. Males aged 25-49\u2009years accounted for 43% of cases visiting forests but only 24% of the study population. Children did not travel. Women, forest dwellers and farmers did not travel beyond union boundaries. Military personnel travelled the furthest especially to remote forested areas.Spread of malaria and antimalarial resistance through human movement present major threats to current goals to eliminate the disease. Bordering the Greater Mekong Subregion, southeast Bangladesh is a potentially important route of spread to India and beyond, but information on travel patterns in this area are lacking.Using a standardised short survey tool, 2090 patients with malaria were interviewed at 57 study sites in 2015-2016 about their demographics and travel patterns in the preceding 2\u2009months.","1560":" T cells expressing the same TCRB is 1.1 cell. Since TCRA co-expression studies could only increase repertoire diversity, these results reveal that the number of na\u00efve T cells with unique TCRs approaches the number of na\u00efve cells. Since thymocytes undergo multiple rounds of divisions after TCRB rearrangement and 3-5% of thymocytes survive thymic selection events the number of cells expressing the same TCRB was expected to be much higher. Thus, these results suggest a new repertoire selection mechanism, which strongly selects for full TCRB diversity.","1561":"As rich biomedical data streams are accumulating across people and time, they provide a powerful opportunity to address limitations in our existing scientific knowledge and to overcome operational challenges in healthcare and life sciences. Yet the relative weighting of insights vs. methodologies in our current research ecosystem tends to skew the computational community away from algorithm evaluation and operationalization, resulting in a well-reported trend towards the proliferation of scientific outcomes of unknown reliability. Algorithm selection and use is hindered by several problems that persist across our field. One is the impact of the self-assessment bias, which can lead to mis-representations in the accuracy of research results. A second challenge is the impact of data context on algorithm performance. Biology and medicine are dynamic and heterogeneous. Data is collected under varying conditions. For algorithms, this means that performance is not universal - and need to be evaluated across a range of contexts. These issues are increasingly difficult as algorithms are trained and used on data collected in the real-world, outside of the traditional clinical research lab. In these cases, data collection is neither supervised nor well controlled and data access may be limited by privacy or proprietary reasons. Therefore, there is a risk that algorithms will be applied to data that are outside of the scope of the intent of the original training data provided. This workshop will focus on approaches that are emerging across the researcher community to quantify the accuracy of algorithms and the reliability of their outputs.","1562":"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox and reactivation of latent VZV causes herpes zoster (HZ). VZV reactivation is subject to the opposing mechanisms of declining and boosted VZV-specific cellular mediated immunity (CMI). A reduction in exogenous re-exposure 'opportunities' through universal chickenpox vaccination could therefore lead to an increase in HZ incidence. We present the first individual-based model that integrates within-host data on VZV-CMI and between-host transmission data to simulate HZ incidence. This model allows estimating currently unknown pivotal biomedical parameters, including the duration of exogenous boosting at 2 years, with a peak threefold to fourfold increase of VZV-CMI; the VZV weekly reactivation probability at 5% and VZV subclinical reactivation having no effect on VZV-CMI. A 100% effective chickenpox vaccine given to 1 year olds would cause a 1.75 times peak increase in HZ 31 years after implementation. This increase is predicted to occur mainly in younger age groups than is currently assumed. ","1563":"Evolutionary biologists have long trained their sights on adaptation, focusing on the power of natural selection to produce relative fitness advantages while often ignoring changes in absolute fitness. Ecologists generally have taken a different tack, focusing on changes in abundance and ranges that reflect absolute fitness while often ignoring relative fitness. Uniting these perspectives, we articulate various causes of relative and absolute maladaptation and review numerous examples of their occurrence. This review indicates that maladaptation is reasonably common from both perspectives, yet often in contrasting ways. That is, maladaptation can appear strong from a relative fitness perspective, yet populations can be growing in abundance. Conversely, resident individuals can appear locally adapted (relative to nonresident individuals) yet be declining in abundance. Understanding and interpreting these disconnects between relative and absolute maladaptation, as well as the cases of agreement, is increasingly critical in the face of accelerating human-mediated environmental change. We therefore present a framework for studying maladaptation, focusing in particular on the relationship between absolute and relative fitness, thereby drawing together evolutionary and ecological perspectives. The unification of these ecological and evolutionary perspectives has the potential to bring together previously disjunct research areas while addressing key conceptual issues and specific practical problems.","1564":"We constructed dynamic, stochastic, agent-based network models for each region. We compared adult HIV incidence after 10 years under three scenarios: (1) \"Current Practice,\" (2) \"Home HTC\" with linkage to ART for eligible persons (CD4 <350) and (3) \"ART for SDCs\" regardless of CD4, delivered alongside home HTC.ART for SDCs reduced HIV incidence by 38% versus Home HTC: from 1.12 (95% CI: 0.98-1.26) to 0.68 (0.54-0.82) cases per 100 person-years (py) in KZN, and from 0.56 (0.50-0.62) to 0.35 (0.30-0.39) cases per 100 py in SW Uganda. A quarter of incident HIV infections were averted over 10 years, and the proportion of virally suppressed HIV-positive persons increased approximately 15%.Using home HTC to identify SDCs and deliver universal ART could avert substantially more new HIV infections than home HTC alone, with a smaller number needed to treat to prevent new HIV infections. Scale-up of home HTC will not diminish the effectiveness of targeting SDCs for treatment. Increasing rates of couples' testing, disclosure, and linkage to care is an efficient way to increase the impact of home HTC interventions on HIV incidence.Antiretroviral therapy (ART) prevents HIV transmission within HIV serodiscordant couples (SDCs), but slow implementation and low uptake has limited its impact on population-level HIV incidence. Home HIV testing and counselling (HTC) campaigns could increase ART uptake among SDCs by incorporating couples' testing and ART referral. We estimated the reduction in adult HIV incidence achieved by incorporating universal ART for SDCs into home HTC campaigns in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa, and southwestern (SW) Uganda.","1565":"Non-polio enteroviruses (NPEV) cause significant disease worldwide. Population-based sero-surveillance, by measuring antibodies against specific NPEV types, provides additional information on past circulation and the prediction for future upsurges. Virus neutralisation assays (VNA), the current method of choice for measuring NPEV type specific antibodies, are not entirely standardised. Via the European Non-Polio Enterovirus Network, we organised a VNA quality assessment in which twelve laboratories participated. We provided five echovirus (E) types (E1, E18, E30 G2, E30 G6 and E6) and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) as a sample for the NPEV VNA quality assessment. Differences in VNA protocols and neutralising Ab (nAb) titres were found between the participating laboratories with geometric coefficients of variation ranging from 10.3-62.9\u200a%. Mixed-effects regression analysis indicated a small but significant effect of type of cell line used. Harmonisation of cell line passage number, however, did not improve variation between laboratories. Calibration by making use of a reference sample, reduced variation between laboratories but differences in nAb titres remained higher than two log2 dilution steps. In conclusion, sero-surveillance data from different laboratories should be compared with caution and standardised protocols are needed.","1566":"Food web structure plays an important role in determining ecosystem stability against perturbations. High-latitude marine ecosystems are being affected by environmental stressors and biological invasions. In the West Antarctic Peninsula these transformations are mainly driven by climate change, while in the sub-Antarctic region by anthropogenic activities. Understanding the differences between these areas is necessary to monitor the changes that are expected to occur in the upcoming decades. Here, we compared the structure and stability of Antarctic (Potter Cove) and sub-Antarctic (Beagle Channel) marine food webs. We compiled species trophic interactions (predator-prey) and calculated complexity, structure and stability metrics. Even if both food webs presented the same connectance, we found important differences between them. The Beagle Channel food web is more complex, but less stable and sensitive to the loss of its most connected species, while the Potter Cove food web presented lower complexity and greater stability against perturbations.","1567":"Anthropogenic disturbances resulting from human land use affect forest landscapes over a range of spatial and temporal scales, with diverse influences on vegetation patterns and dynamics. These processes fall within the scope of the coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) concept, which has emerged as an important framework for understanding the reciprocal interactions and feedbacks that connect human activities and ecosystem responses. Spatial simulation modeling of forest landscape change is an important technique for exploring the dynamics of CHANS over large areas and long time periods. Landscape models for simulating interactions between human activities and forest landscape dynamics can be grouped into two main categories. Forest landscape models (FLMs) focus on landscapes where forests are the dominant land cover and simulate succession and natural disturbances along with forest management activities. In contrast, land change models (LCMs) simulate mosaics of different land cover and land use classes that include forests in addition to other land uses such as developed areas and agricultural lands. There are also several examples of coupled models that combine elements of FLMs and LCMs. These integrated models are particularly useful for simulating human\u0096natural interactions in landscapes where human settlement and agriculture are expanding into forested areas. Despite important differences in spatial scale and disciplinary scope, FLMs and LCMs have many commonalities in conceptual design and technical implementation that can facilitate continued integration. The ultimate goal will be to implement forest landscape disturbance modeling in a CHANS framework that recognizes the contextual effects of regional land use and other human activities on the forest ecosystem while capturing the reciprocal influences of forests and their disturbances on the broader land use mosaic.","1568":"SM was not associated with differences in baseline demographic or clinical features of participants in this study, nor with additional parasitic infections. Covariate-adjusted analyses indicated that infection with SM was associated with a 4% higher estimated proportion of active TB cases in HIV-uninfected individuals and a 14% higher estimated proportion of active TB cases in HIV-infected individuals. There were no differences in estimated proportions of LTBI cases.We provide evidence that SM infection is associated with a higher probability of active TB disease, particularly in HIV-infected individuals.Helminth infections can modulate immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). However, the effect of helminths, including Schistosoma mansoni (SM), on Mtb infection outcomes is less clear. Furthermore, HIV is a known risk factor for tuberculosis (TB) disease and has been implicated in SM pathogenesis. Therefore, it is important to evaluate whether HIV modifies the association between SM and Mtb infection.We used targeted minimum loss estimation and super learning to estimate a covariate-adjusted association between SM and Mtb infection outcomes, defined as the probability of being Mtb-uninfected healthy controls, LTBI, or TB. HIV status was evaluated as an effect modifier of this association.HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected adults were enrolled in Kisumu County, Kenya, between 2014 and 2017 and categorized into 3 groups based on Mtb infection status: Mtb-uninfected healthy controls, latent TB infection (LTBI), and active TB disease. Participants were subsequently evaluated for infection with SM.","1569":"Serosurveillance provides a unique opportunity to quantify the proportion of the population that has been exposed to pathogens. Here, we developed and piloted Serosurveillance for Continuous, ActionabLe Epidemiologic Intelligence of Transmission (SCALE-IT), a platform through which we systematically tested remnant samples from routine blood draws in two major hospital networks in San Francisco for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during the early months of the pandemic. Importantly, SCALE-IT allows for algorithmic sample selection and rich data on covariates by leveraging electronic health record data. We estimated overall seroprevalence at 4.2%, corresponding to a case ascertainment rate of only 4.9%, and identified important heterogeneities by neighborhood, homelessness status, and race\/ethnicity. Neighborhood seroprevalence estimates from SCALE-IT were comparable to local community-based surveys, while providing results encompassing the entire city that have been previously unavailable. Leveraging this hybrid serosurveillance approach has strong potential for application beyond this local context and for diseases other than SARS-CoV-2.","1570":"Few head-to-head evaluations of immune responses to different vaccines have been reported.Surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) antibody levels of adults receiving either two doses of BNT162b2 (n\u00a0=\u00a0366) or CoronaVac (n\u00a0=\u00a0360) vaccines in Hong Kong were determined. An age-matched subgroup (BNT162b2 [n\u00a0=\u00a049] vs. CoronaVac [n\u00a0=\u00a049]) was tested for plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT) and spike-binding antibody and T-cell reactivity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Vaccination with BNT162b2 induces stronger humoral responses than CoronaVac. CoronaVac induces higher CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to the structural protein than BNT162b2.One month after the second dose of vaccine, BNT162b2 elicited significantly higher PRNT50 , PRNT90 , sVNT, spike receptor binding, spike N-terminal domain binding, spike S2 domain binding, spike FcR binding and antibody avidity levels than CoronaVac. The geometric mean PRNT50 titres in those vaccinated with BNT162b2 and CoronaVac vaccines were 251.6 and 69.45, while PRNT90 titres were 98.91 and 16.57, respectively. All of those vaccinated with BNT162b2 and 45 (91.8%) of 49 vaccinated with CoronaVac achieved the 50% protection threshold for PRNT90. Allowing for an expected seven-fold waning of antibody titres over 6\u2009months for those receiving CoronaVac, only 16.3% would meet the 50% protection threshold versus 79.6% of BNT162b2 vaccinees. Age was negatively correlated with PRNT90 antibody titres. Both vaccines induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses at 1\u00a0month post-vaccination but CoronaVac elicited significantly higher structural protein-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses.","1571":"Influenza A has two hemagglutinin groups, with stronger cross-immunity to reinfection within than between groups. Here, we explore the implications of this heterogeneity for proposed cross-protective influenza vaccines that may offer broad, but not universal, protection. While the development goal for the breadth of human influenza A vaccine is to provide cross-group protection, vaccines in current development stages may provide better protection against target groups than non-target groups. To evaluate vaccine formulation and strategies, we propose a novel perspective: a vaccine population-level target product profile (PTPP). Under this perspective, we use dynamical models to quantify the epidemiological impacts of future influenza A vaccines as a function of their properties. Our results show that the interplay of natural and vaccine-induced immunity could strongly affect seasonal subtype dynamics. A broadly protective bivalent vaccine could lower the incidence of both groups and achieve elimination with sufficient vaccination coverage. However, a univalent vaccine at low vaccination rates could permit a resurgence of the non-target group when the vaccine provides weaker immunity than natural infection. Moreover, as a proxy for pandemic simulation, we analyze the invasion of a variant that evades natural immunity. We find that a future vaccine providing sufficiently broad and long-lived cross-group protection at a sufficiently high vaccination rate, could prevent pandemic emergence and lower the pandemic burden. This study highlights that as well as effectiveness, breadth and duration should be considered in epidemiologically informed TPPs for future human influenza A vaccines.","1572":"Reports of symptomatic rebound and\/or test re-positivity among COVID-19 patients following the standard five-day treatment course of nirmatrelvir\/ritonavir have sparked debates regarding optimal treatment timing and dosage. It is unclear whether initiating nirmatrelvir\/ritonavir immediately after symptom onset would improve clinical outcomes and\/or lead to post-treatment viral burden rebound due to inadequate viral clearance during treatment. Here we show that, by emulating a randomized target trial using real-world electronic medical record data from all 87,070 adult users of nirmatrelvir\/ritonavir in Hong Kong between 16th March 2022 and 15th January 2023, early initiation of nirmatrelvir\/ritonavir treatment (0 to 1 days after symptom onset or diagnosis) significantly reduced the incidence of 28-day all-cause mortality and hospitalization compared to delayed initiation (2 or more days) (absolute risk reduction [ARR]: 1.50% (95% confidence interval 1.17-1.80%); relative risk [RR]: 0.77 (0.73, 0.82)), but may be associated with a significant elevated risk of viral burden rebound (ARR: -1.08% (-1.55%, -0.46%)), although the latter estimates were associated with high uncertainty due to limited sample sizes. As such, patients should continue to initiate nirmatrelvir\/ritonavir early after symptom onset or diagnosis to better protect against the more serious outcomes of hospitalization and mortality.","1573":"Our models achieve a cross-validation accuracy of 84.03% in classifying the presence or absence of severe AD neuropathology, and an external-validation accuracy of 70.14% in classifying in vivo amyloid positivity status.Our models show that clinically accessible features, including APOE genotype and cortical thinning encompassing AD meta-ROIs, are able to classify both postmortem confirmed AD neuropathological status and in vivo amyloid status with reasonable accuracies. These results suggest the potential utility of AD meta-ROIs in determining AD neuropathological status in living persons.AD neuropathological status are assessed at postmortem for participants from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). Clinically available features are utilized, including demographics, Apolipoprotein E(APOE) genotype, and cortical thicknesses derived from ante-mortem MRI scans encompassing AD meta regions of interest (meta-ROI). Both logistic regression and random forest models are trained to identify linearly and nonlinearly separable features between participants with the presence (N\u200a=\u200a91, age-at-MRI\u200a=\u200a73.6\u00b19.24, 38 women) or absence (N\u200a=\u200a53, age-at-MRI\u200a=\u200a68.93\u00b119.69, 24 women) of severe AD neuropathology. The trained models are further validated in an external data set against in vivo amyloid biomarkers derived from PET imaging (amyloid-positive: N\u200a=\u200a71, age-at-MRI\u200a=\u200a74.17\u00b16.37, 26 women; amyloid-negative: N\u200a=\u200a73, age-at-MRI\u200a=\u200a71.59\u00b16.80, 41 women).Computer-aided machine learning models are being actively developed with clinically available biomarkers to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD) in living persons. Despite considerable work with cross-sectional in vivo data, many models lack validation against postmortem AD neuropathological data.Train machine learning models to classify the presence or absence of autopsy-confirmed severe AD neuropathology using clinically available features.","1574":"For infectious diseases such as pertussis, susceptibility is determined by immunity, which is chronological age-dependent. We consider an age-structured epidemiological model that accounts for both passively acquired maternal antibodies that decay and active immunity that wanes, permitting reinfection. The model is a 6-dimensional system of partial differential equations (PDE). By assuming constant rates within each age-group, the PDE system can be reduced to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system with aging from one age-group to the next. We derive formulae for the effective reproduction number \u211b and provide their biological interpretation in some special cases. We show that the disease-free equilibrium is stable when \u211b  1.","1575":"Mosquitoes carrying the endosymbiont bacterium Wolbachia have been deployed in field trials as a biological control intervention due to Wolbachia effects on reducing transmission of arboviruses. We performed mark, release and recapture (MRR) experiments using Wolbachia as an internal marker with daily collections with BG-Traps during the first two weeks of releases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The MRR design allowed us to investigate two critical parameters that determine whether Wolbachia would successful invade a field population: the probability of daily survival (PDS) of Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti females, and the wild population density during releases. Released females had a PDS of 0.82 and 0.89 in the first and second weeks, respectively, immediately after releases, which is well within the range of previous estimates of survivorship of wild mosquitoes in Rio de Janeiro. Abundance estimation of wild population varied up to 10-fold higher depending on the estimation method used (634-3565 females on the average-difference model to 6365-16188 females according to Lincoln-Petersen). Wolbachia-released mosquitoes were lower than the density estimation of their wild counterparts, irrespectively of the model used. Individually screening mosquitoes for the presence of Wolbachia reduced uncertainty on abundance estimations due to fluctuation in capturing per week. A successful invasion into local population requires Ae. aegypti fitness is unaffected by Wolbachia presence, but also reliable estimates on the population size of wild mosquitoes. ","1576":"The universal mercury vapor black light trap is an effective device used for collecting moth specimens in a wide variety of habitats; yet, they can present challenges for researchers. The mercury vapor trap is often powered by a heavy automotive battery making it difficult to conduct extensive surveys in remote regions. The mercury vapor trap also carries a considerable financial cost per trap unit, making trapping challenging with low research budgets. Here, we describe the development and trapping properties of a lighter, simply constructed, and less expensive trap. The LED funnel trap consists of a funnel, soda bottles with plastic vanes, and is powered by rechargeable 9-V batteries. Two strips of low-wavelength LEDs are used as attractants. We tested the trapping parameters of this trap design compared to a standard mercury vapor trap over 10 trap nights in a suburban woodlot in the summer of 2015. The mercury vapor trap caught significantly more moth individuals than the LED trap (average of 78 vs 40 moths per trap night; P < 0.05), and significantly more species than the LED trap (23 vs 15 per trap night; P < 0.05); the mercury vapor trap caught a total of 104 macromoth species over the duration of the study, compared to a total of 87 by the LED trap. Despite the lower yields, the low cost of the LED trap (<$30 ea.) makes it superior to the mercury vapor trap in cost-acquisition per moth species and per moth individual trapped. The LED trap may be a viable alternative to the standard mercury vapor trap, facilitating insect trapping in more diverse settings.","1577":"As transmission intensity has declined in Senegal, so has the genetic complexity of circulating Plasmodium falciparum parasites, resulting in specific genotypes emerging and persisting over years. We address whether changes in parasite genetic signatures can alter the immune repertoire to variant surface antigens, and whether such responses can influence the expansion or contraction of specific parasite genotypes in the population. We characterize parasites within genotypic clusters, defined as identical by a 24-SNP molecular barcode and a haplotype identifier for other highly polymorphic loci; we measure expression of variant surface antigens (VSA) such as PfEMP-1 by transcript expression typing and expressed var DBL1\u03b1 sequencing in ex vivo and short-term adapted RNA samples; and we measure IgG responses against VSAs from short-term adapted parasites. We find that parasites within genotypic clusters are genetically identical at other highly polymorphic loci. These parasites express similar Ups var classes and largely the same dominant var DBL1\u03b1 sequences ex vivo. These parasites are recognized similarly by anti-VSA antibodies after short-term adaptation to culture; however, antibody responses do not correlate with genotype frequencies over time. Both genotype-specific and multiple genotype-reactive surface IgG responses are observed in this population. Parasites with identical genomes are extremely similar in their expression and host antibody recognition of VSAs. Monitoring changes in population-level parasite genomics and transmission dynamics is critical, as fluctuations will influence the breadth of resulting host immune responses to circulating parasite genotypes. These findings suggest shared immune recognition of genetically similar parasites, which has implications for both our understanding of immunity and vaccine development strategies in malaria elimination settings.","1578":" vectors demonstrated predator avoidance behavior during oviposition. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that predators limit disease transmission by reducing both vector survival and vector size, and that associations between drought and human West Nile virus cases could be driven by the vector behavior of predator avoidance during oviposition. These findings are likely to be useful to infectious disease modelers who rely on vector traits as predictors of transmission.","1579":"Malaria burden on Bioko Island has decreased significantly over the past 15 years. The impact of interventions on malaria prevalence, however, has recently stalled. Here, we use data from island-wide, annual malaria indicator surveys to investigate human movement patterns and their relationship to Plasmodium falciparum prevalence. Using geostatistical and mathematical modelling, we find that off-island travel is more prevalent in and around the capital, Malabo. The odds of malaria infection among off-island travelers are significantly higher than the rest of the population. We estimate that malaria importation rates are high enough to explain malaria prevalence in much of Malabo and its surroundings, and that local transmission is highest along the West Coast of the island. Despite uncertainty, these estimates of residual transmission and importation serve as a basis for evaluating progress towards elimination and for efficiently allocating resources as Bioko makes the transition from control to elimination.","1580":"Governments are attempting to control the COVID-19 pandemic with nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). However, the effectiveness of different NPIs at reducing transmission is poorly understood. We gathered chronological data on the implementation of NPIs for several European, and other, countries between January and the end of May 2020. We estimate the effectiveness of NPIs, ranging from limiting gathering sizes, business closures, and closure of educational institutions to stay-at-home orders. To do so, we used a Bayesian hierarchical model that links NPI implementation dates to national case and death counts and supported the results with extensive empirical validation. Closing all educational institutions, limiting gatherings to 10 people or less, and closing face-to-face businesses each reduced transmission considerably. The additional effect of stay-at-home orders was comparatively small.","1581":"Telehealth monitoring significantly reduced postpartum readmissions, 3.7% (8\/214) versus 0.5% (1\/214), and resulted in higher quality-adjusted life years. Telehealth monitoring was cost-effective and cost-saving. Average cost of telehealth per patient was $309, and was cost-effective to a cost of $420 per patient. Telehealth monitoring remained cost-effective down to an admission cost of $10,999 compared to our baseline-estimate for the average admission cost of $14,401. Telehealth monitoring also remained cost-effective when the postpartum readmission rate was 3.0% or higher with standard monitoring. With a cost saving of $93 per patient and an estimated 333,253 pregnant women with hypertension in the US a year, telehealth could reduce health care costs in the US by approximately $31 million a year.A decision tree was developed using results from a non-randomized controlled trial comparing telehealth to standard outpatient blood pressure monitoring. At discharge, postpartum women with a hypertensive disorder received a Bluetooth tablet, blood pressure monitor, and scale to submit vitals daily for 6\u2009weeks. Women were managed and treated with a standard protocol. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis using data from the hospital, device manufacturer supplied charges, and utilities. A cost-effectiveness threshold was set at $100,000\/quality-adjusted life years. One-way and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of our results compared to baseline assumptions.This study demonstrates telehealth with remote blood pressure monitoring may be a cost-effective and cost-saving solution for management of postpartum hypertension.Evaluate cost-effectiveness of telehealth with remote monitoring for postpartum hypertensive disorders from the hospital's perspective.","1582":"The original study aimed to describe HIV transmission patterns by age and race\/ethnicity among men who have sex with men in King County, Washington, by applying probabilistic phylodynamic modelling methods to HIV-1 pol gene sequences collected through MHS. In September 2020, we paused the publication of this research to conduct community engagement: we held two public-facing online presentations, met with a national community coalition that included representatives of networks of people living with HIV, and invited two members of this coalition to provide feedback on our manuscript. During each of these meetings, we shared a brief presentation of our methods and findings and explicitly solicited feedback on the perceived public health benefit and potential harm of our analyses and results.Some community concerns about MHS in public health practice also apply to research using MHS data, namely those related to informed consent, inference of transmission directionality and criminalization. Other critiques were specific to our research study and included feedback about the use of phylogenetic analyses to study assortativity by race\/ethnicity and the importance of considering the broader context of stigma and structural racism. We ultimately decided the potential harms of publishing our study-perpetuating racialized stigma about men who have sex with men and eroding the trust between phylogenetics researchers and communities of people living with HIV-outweighed the potential benefits.HIV phylogenetics research using data collected through MHS data is a powerful scientific technology with the potential to benefit and harm communities of people living with HIV. Addressing criminalization and including people living with HIV in decision-making processes have the potential to meaningfully address community concerns and strengthen the ethical justification for using MHS data in both research and public health practice. We close with specific opportunities for action and advocacy by researchers.The widespread implementation of molecular HIV surveillance (MHS) has resulted in an increased discussion about the ethical, human rights and public health implications of MHS. We narrate our process of pausing our research that uses data collected through MHS in response to these growing concerns and summarize the key lessons we learned through conversations with community members.","1583":"Understanding of spatiotemporal transmission of infectious diseases has improved significantly in recent years. Advances in Bayesian inference methods for individual-level geo-located epidemiological data have enabled reconstruction of transmission trees and quantification of disease spread in space and time, while accounting for uncertainty in missing data. However, these methods have rarely been applied to endemic diseases or ones in which asymptomatic infection plays a role, for which additional estimation methods are required. Here, we develop such methods to analyze longitudinal incidence data on visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and its sequela, post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), in a highly endemic community in Bangladesh. Incorporating recent data on VL and PKDL infectiousness, we show that while VL cases drive transmission when incidence is high, the contribution of PKDL increases significantly as VL incidence declines (reaching 55% in this setting). Transmission is highly focal: 85% of mean distances from inferred infectors to their secondary VL cases were <300 m, and estimated average times from infector onset to secondary case infection were <4 mo for 88% of VL infectors, but up to 2.9 y for PKDL infectors. Estimated numbers of secondary cases per VL and PKDL case varied from 0 to 6 and were strongly correlated with the infector's duration of symptoms. Counterfactual simulations suggest that prevention of PKDL could have reduced overall VL incidence by up to 25%. These results highlight the need for prompt detection and treatment of PKDL to achieve VL elimination in the Indian subcontinent and provide quantitative estimates to guide spatiotemporally targeted interventions against VL.","1584":"Mechanistic within-host models of parasite dynamics were identified through a review of published literature. For a subset of these, model code was reproduced and descriptive statistics compared between the models using fitted data. Through simulation and model analysis, key features of the models were compared, including assumptions on growth, immune response components, variant switching mechanisms, and inter-individual variability.The assessed within-host malaria models generally replicate infection dynamics in malaria-na\u00efve individuals. However, there are substantial differences between the model dynamics after disease onset, and models do not always reproduce late infection parasitaemia data used for calibration of the within host infections. Models have attempted to capture the considerable variability in parasite dynamics between individuals by including stochastic parasite multiplication rates; variant switching dynamics leading to immune escape; variable effects of the host immune responses; or via probabilistic events. For models that capture realistic length of infections, model representations of innate immunity explain early peaks in infection density that cause clinical symptoms, and model representations of antibody immune responses control the length of infection. Models differed in their assumptions concerning variant switching dynamics, reflecting uncertainty in the underlying mechanisms of variant switching revealed by recent clinical data during early infection. Overall, given the scarce availability of the biological evidence there is limited support for complex models.Malaria blood-stage infection length and intensity are important drivers of disease and transmission; however, the underlying mechanisms of parasite growth and the host's immune response during infection remain largely unknown. Over the last 30\u00a0years, several mechanistic mathematical models of malaria parasite within-host dynamics have been published and used in malaria transmission models.This study suggests that much of the inter-individual variability observed in clinical malaria infections has traditionally been attributed in models to random variability, rather than mechanistic disease dynamics. Thus, it is proposed that newly developed models should assume simple immune dynamics that minimally capture mechanistic understandings and avoid over-parameterization and large stochasticity which inaccurately represent unknown disease mechanisms.","1585":"Our study found the training was effective in increasing the knowledge of ticks, tick-borne diseases, and surveillance as well as promoting positive attitudes related to surveillance. While the training, by itself, was not associated with increases in surveillance practices, we were able to empower local public health officials with the knowledge and positive attitudes needed to enact change.We developed and delivered in-person training at local health department offices in each of six Illinois Department of Public Health Environmental Health Regions between April-May of 2019. Pre-, post-, and six-month follow-up questionnaires on knowledge, attitudes, and practices with regards to tick surveillance were administered to training participants. Paired student's t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to compare knowledge, attitudes, and practices scores between questionnaires with Cohen's d being used to calculate effect sizes associated with t-tests. McNemar's and McNemar-Bowker tests were used to evaluate individual questions. Spearman's rank correlation was used to evaluate the relationship between knowledge, attitudes, and practices at pre-, post-, and six-month follow-up.The number of cases of tick-borne diseases in humans is increasing rapidly within Illinois. The responsibility for increased surveillance of tick-borne disease cases and tick vectors is being placed on local health departments throughout the United States, but they often lack the funding, time, and\/or training needed to perform said surveillance. The aims of this study were to develop, deliver, and determine the effectiveness of tick surveillance training workshops for local health department employees within Illinois.Seventy-six employees from 40 local health departments that represent 44% (45\/102) of Illinois counties attended at least one training workshop. Of these attendees, 81.5% (62\/76) participated in at least one survey, 79% (60\/76) in the in-person pre-training survey, 74% (56\/76) in the in-person post-training survey, and 22% (17\/76) in the online six-month follow-up survey. The average knowledge score was significantly increased by 8.21 (95% CI:7.28-9.14) points from pre-training to post-training. The average overall attitude score significantly increased by 5.29 (95% CI: 3.91-6.66) points from pre- to post-training. There were no significant differences in practice scores.","1586":"In settings with zero community transmission, any new SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks are likely to be the result of random incursions. The level of restrictions in place at the time of the incursion is likely to considerably affect possible outbreak trajectories, but the probability that a large outbreak eventuates is not known.Because the chance of an incursion occurring is closely related to border controls, outbreak risk management strategies require an integrated approaching spanning border controls, ongoing restrictions, and plans for response. Each individual restriction or control strategy reduces the risk of an outbreak. They can be traded off against each other, but if too many are removed there is a danger of accumulating an unsafe level of risk. The outbreak probabilities estimated in this study are of particular relevance in assessing the downstream risks associated with increased international travel.We found that a future incursion has a 45% probability of causing an outbreak (defined as a 7-day average of\u2009>\u20095 new cases per day within 60\u00a0days) if no restrictions were in place, decreasing to 23% with a mandatory masks policy, density restrictions on venues such as restaurants, and if employees worked from home where possible. A drop in community symptomatic testing rates was associated with up to a 10-percentage point increase in outbreak probability, highlighting the importance of maintaining high testing rates as part of a suppression strategy.We used an agent-based model to investigate the relationship between ongoing restrictions and behavioural factors, and the probability of an incursion causing an outbreak and the resulting growth rate. We applied our model to the state of Victoria, Australia, which has reached zero community transmission as of November 2020.","1587":"Many parasites have external transmission stages that persist in the environment prior to infecting a new host. Understanding how long these stages can persist, and how abiotic conditions such as temperature affect parasite persistence, is important for predicting infection dynamics and parasite responses to future environmental change. In this study, we explored environmental persistence and thermal tolerance of a debilitating protozoan parasite that infects monarch butterflies. Parasite transmission occurs when dormant spores, shed by adult butterflies onto host plants and other surfaces, are later consumed by caterpillars. We exposed parasite spores to a gradient of ecologically-relevant temperatures for 2, 35, or 93 weeks. We tested spore viability by feeding controlled spore doses to susceptible monarch larvae, and examined relationships between temperature, time, and resulting infection metrics. We also examined whether distinct parasite genotypes derived from replicate migratory and resident monarch populations differed in their thermal tolerance. Finally, we examined evidence for a trade-off between short-term within-host replication and long-term persistence ability. Parasite viability decreased in response to warmer temperatures over moderate-to-long time scales. Individual parasite genotypes showed high heterogeneity in viability, but differences did not cluster by migratory vs. resident monarch populations. We found no support for a negative relationship between environmental persistence and within-host replication, as might be expected if parasites invest in short-term reproduction at the cost of longer-term survival. Findings here indicate that dormant spores can survive for many months under cooler conditions, and that heat dramatically shortens the window of transmission for this widespread and virulent butterfly parasite.","1588":"The rapid development of vaccines to combat the spread of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a great scientific achievement. Before the development of the COVID-19 vaccines, most studies capitalized on the available data that did not include pharmaceutical measures. Such studies focused on the impact of non-pharmaceutical measures such as social distancing, sanitation, use of face masks, and lockdowns to study the spread of COVID-19. In this study, we used the SIDARTHE-V model, an extension of the SIDARTHE model, which includes vaccination rollouts. We studied the impact of vaccination on the severity of the virus, specifically focusing on death rates, in African countries. The SIRDATHE-V model parameters were extracted by simultaneously fitting the COVID-19 cumulative data of deaths, recoveries, active cases, and full vaccinations reported by the governments of Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, Togo, and Zambia. Using South Africa as a case study, our analysis showed that the cumulative death rates declined drastically with the increased extent of vaccination drives. Whilst the infection rates sometimes increased with the arrival of new coronavirus variants, the death rates did not increase as they did before vaccination.","1589":"Metagenomic Hi-C (metaHi-C) can identify contig-to-contig relationships with respect to their proximity within the same physical cell. Shotgun libraries in metaHi-C experiments can be constructed by next-generation sequencing (short-read metaHi-C) or more recent third-generation sequencing (long-read metaHi-C). However, all existing metaHi-C analysis methods are developed and benchmarked on short-read metaHi-C datasets and there exists much room for improvement in terms of more scalable and stable analyses, especially for long-read metaHi-C data. Here we report MetaCC, an efficient and integrative framework for analyzing both short-read and long-read metaHi-C datasets. MetaCC outperforms existing methods on normalization and binning. In particular, the MetaCC normalization module, named NormCC, is more than 3000 times faster than the current state-of-the-art method HiCzin on a complex wastewater dataset. When applied to one sheep gut long-read metaHi-C dataset, MetaCC binning module can retrieve 709 high-quality genomes with the largest species diversity using one single sample, including an expansion of five uncultured members from the order Erysipelotrichales, and is the only binner that can recover the genome of one important species Bacteroides vulgatus. Further plasmid analyses reveal that MetaCC binning is able to capture multi-copy plasmids.","1590":"Background: \r\nPopulation-level estimates of disease prevalence and control are needed to assess prevention and treatment strategies. However, available data often suffer from differential missingness. For example, population-level HIV viral suppression is the proportion of all HIV-positive persons with suppressed viral replication. Individuals with measured HIV status, and among HIV-positive individuals those with measured viral suppression, likely differ from those without such measurements.\r\n\r\nMethods: \r\nWe discuss three sets of assumptions to identify population-level suppression in the intervention arm of the SEARCH Study (NCT01864603), a community randomized trial in rural Kenya and Uganda (2013\u00962017). Using data on nearly 100,000 participants, we compare estimates from (1) an unadjusted approach assuming data are missing-completely-at-random (MCAR); (2) stratification on age group, sex, and community; and (3) targeted maximum likelihood estimation to adjust for a larger set of baseline and time-updated variables.\r\n\r\nResults: \r\nDespite high measurement coverage, estimates of population-level viral suppression varied by identification assumption. Unadjusted estimates were most optimistic: 50% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 46%, 54%) of HIV-positive persons suppressed at baseline, 80% (95% CI = 78%, 82%) at year 1, 85% (95% CI = 83%, 86%) at year 2, and 85% (95% CI = 83%, 87%) at year 3. Stratifying on baseline predictors yielded slightly lower estimates, and full adjustment reduced estimates meaningfully: 42% (95% CI = 37%, 46%) of HIV-positive persons suppressed at baseline, 71% (95% CI = 69%, 73%) at year 1, 76% (95% CI = 74%, 78%) at year 2, and 79% (95% CI = 77%, 81%) at year 3.\r\n\r\nConclusions: \r\nEstimation of population-level disease burden and control requires appropriate adjustment for missing data. Even in large studies with limited missingness, estimates relying on the MCAR assumption or baseline stratification should be interpreted cautiously.","1591":"A surprising feature of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to date is the low burdens reported in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries relative to other global regions. Potential explanations (e.g., warmer environments [1], younger populations [2,3,4]) have yet to be framed within a comprehensive analysis accounting for factors that may offset the effects of climate and demography. Here, we synthesize factors hypothesized to shape the pace of this pandemic and its burden as it moves across SSA, encompassing demographic, comorbidity, climatic, healthcare and intervention capacity, and human mobility dimensions of risk. We find large scale diversity in probable drivers, such that outcomes are likely to be highly variable among SSA countries. While simulation shows that extensive climatic variation among SSA population centers has little effect on early outbreak trajectories, heterogeneity in connectivity is likely to play a large role in shaping the pace of viral spread. The prolonged, asynchronous outbreaks expected in weakly connected settings may result in extended stress to health systems. In addition, the observed variability in comorbidities and access to care will likely modulate the severity of infection: We show that even small shifts in the infection fatality ratio towards younger ages, which are likely in high risk settings, can eliminate the protective effect of younger populations. We highlight countries with elevated risk of slow pace, high burden outbreaks. Empirical data on the spatial extent of outbreaks within SSA countries, their patterns in severity over age, and the relationship between epidemic pace and health system disruptions are urgently needed to guide efforts to mitigate the high burden scenarios explored here.","1592":"As of November 1, 2020, there have been more than 230K deaths and 9M confirmed and probable cases attributable to SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. However, this overwhelming toll has not been distributed equally, with geographic, race-ethnic, age, and socioeconomic disparities in exposure and mortality defining features of the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic.This work suggests that well-documented racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality in hard-hit settings, such as the U.S. state of Michigan, are driven primarily by variation in household, community and workplace exposure rather than case-fatality rates.In crude and age-standardized analyses we found rates of incidence and mortality more than twice as high than Whites for all groups except Native Americans. Blacks experienced the greatest burden of confirmed and probable COVID-19 infection (Age-standardized incidence = 1,626\/100,000 population) and mortality (age-standardized mortality rate 244\/100,000). These rates reflect large disparities, as Blacks experienced age-standardized incidence and mortality rates 5.5 (95% Posterior Credible Interval [CrI] = 5.4, 5.6) and 6.7 (95% CrI = 6.4, 7.1) times higher than Whites, respectively. We found that the bulk of the disparity in mortality between Blacks and Whites is driven by dramatically higher rates of COVID-19 infection across all age groups, particularly among older adults, rather than age-specific variation in case-fatality rates.We used individual-level COVID-19 incidence and mortality data from the U.S. state of Michigan to estimate age-specific incidence and mortality rates by race\/ethnic group. Data were analyzed using hierarchical Bayesian regression models, and model results were validated using posterior predictive checks.","1593":"Previous epidemiological studies on the associations between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and cancer incidence have been inconsistent. We investigated the associations of plasma omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs with the incidence of overall and 19 site-specific cancers in a large prospective cohort. 253,138 eligible UK Biobank participants were included in our study. With a mean follow-up of 12.9\u2009years, 29,838 participants were diagnosed with cancer. The plasma levels of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs were expressed as percentages of total fatty acids (omega-3% and omega-6%). In our main models, both omega-6% and omega-3% were inversely associated with overall cancer incidence (HR per SD\u2009=\u20090.98, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.96-0.99; HR per SD\u2009=\u20090.99, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.97-1.00; respectively). Of the 19 site-specific cancers available, 14 were associated with omega-6% and five with omega-3%, all indicating inverse associations, with the exception that prostate cancer was positively associated with omega-3% (HR per SD\u2009=\u20091.03, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.01-1.05). Our population-based cohort study in UK Biobank indicates small inverse associations of plasma omega-6 and omega-3 PUFAs with the incidence of overall and most site-specific cancers, although there are notable exceptions, such as prostate cancer.","1594":"Experiments and models suggest that climate affects mosquito-borne disease transmission. However, disease transmission involves complex nonlinear interactions between climate and population dynamics, which makes detecting climate drivers at the population level challenging. By analysing incidence data, estimated susceptible population size, and climate data with methods based on nonlinear time series analysis (collectively referred to as empirical dynamic modelling), we identified drivers and their interactive effects on dengue dynamics in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Climatic forcing arose only when susceptible availability was high: temperature and rainfall had net positive and negative effects respectively. By capturing mechanistic, nonlinear and context-dependent effects of population susceptibility, temperature and rainfall on dengue transmission empirically, our model improves forecast skill over recent, state-of-the-art models for dengue incidence. Together, these results provide empirical evidence that the interdependence of host population susceptibility and climate drives dengue dynamics in a nonlinear and complex, yet predictable way.","1595":"Mathematical models are being used extensively in the study of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, becoming an essential tool for decision making concerning disease control. It is now required to understand the mechanisms involved in the interaction between the virus and the immune response effector cells, both innate and adaptive, in order to support lines of research related to the use of drugs, production of protective antibodies and of course, vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. The present study, using a system dynamic approach, hypothesizes over the conditions that characterize the fraction of the population which get infected by SARS-CoV-2 as the asymptomatic patients, the mild symptomatic, acute symptomatic, and also super-spreaders, in terms of innate immune response, the initial virus load, the virus burden with shedding events, and the cytokine levels.","1596":"Promoting asthma self-management education, influenza vaccinations, nebulizers, and spacers can decrease the frequency of healthcare utilization and asthma-related expenditures while improving medication adherence.We obtained patients' data from Medicaid Analytic eXtract files and evaluated patients with persistent asthma in 2010 and 2011. We used difference-in-difference regression to quantify the effect of the intervention on the probability of asthma-related healthcare utilization, asthma medication, and utilization costs. We estimated the average change in outcome measures from pre-intervention\/intervention (2010) to post-intervention (2011) periods for the intervention group by comparing this with the average change in the control group over the same time horizon.We quantify the effect of a set of interventions including asthma self-management education, influenza vaccination, spacers, and nebulizers on healthcare utilization and expenditures for Medicaid-enrolled children with asthma in New York and Michigan.All of the interventions reduced both utilization and asthma medication costs. Asthma self-management education, nebulizer, and spacer interventions reduced the probability of emergency department (20.8-1.5%, 95%CI 19.7-21.9% vs. 0.5-2.5%, respectively) and inpatient (3.5-0.8%, 95%CI 2.1-4.9% vs. 0.4-1.2%, respectively) utilizations. Influenza vaccine decreased the probability of primary care physician (6-3.5%, 95%CI 4.4-7.6% vs. 1.5-5.5%, respectively) visit. The reductions varied by state and intervention.","1597":"219 genotype and 112 secretor studies with data from 38 countries were included in the analysis. Study-level GII.4 proportion among all noroviruses ranged from 0% to 100%. Country secretor proportion ranged from 43.8% to 93.9%. We observed a 0.69% (95% CI: 0.19, 1.18) increase in GII.4 proportion for each percent increase in human secretor proportion, controlling for Human Development Index.Noroviruses are a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis. Genogroup 2 type 4 (GII.4) has been the dominant norovirus genotype worldwide since its emergence in the mid-1990s. Individuals with a functional fucosyltransferase-2 gene, known as secretors, have increased susceptibility to GII.4 noroviruses. We hypothesized that this individual-level trait may drive GII.4 norovirus predominance at the human population level.We conducted a systematic review for studies reporting norovirus outbreak or sporadic case genotypes and merged this with data on proportions of human secretor status in various countries from a separate systematic review. We used inverse variance-weighted linear regression to estimate magnitude of the population secretor-GII.4 proportion association.Norovirus evolution and diversity may be driven by local population human host genetics. Our results may have vaccine development implications including whether specific antigenic formulations would be required for different populations.","1598":"Viral load data can be used to overcome sampling bias in studies of pathogen-pathogen interactions. When applied to respiratory pathogens, we found evidence of viral-SPn facilitation and several examples of viral-viral interference. Multipathogen surveillance is a cost-efficient data collection approach, with added clinical and epidemiological informational value over single-pathogen testing, but requires careful analysis to mitigate selection bias.We conducted an observational, cross-sectional study using samples collected by the Seattle Flu Study between 11 November 2018 and 20 August 2021. Samples that tested positive via RT-qPCR for at least one of 17 potential respiratory pathogens were included in this study. Semi-quantitative cycle threshold (Ct) values were used to measure pathogen load. Differences in pathogen load between monoinfected and coinfected samples were assessed using linear regression adjusting for age, season, and recruitment channel.21,686 samples were positive for at least one potential pathogen. Most prevalent were rhinovirus (33\u00b75%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPn, 29\u00b70%), SARS-CoV-2 (13.8%) and influenza A\/H1N1 (9\u00b76%). 140 potential pathogen pairs were included for analysis, and 56 (40%) pairs yielded significant Ct differences (p < 0.01) between monoinfected and co-infected samples. We observed no virus-virus pairs showing evidence of significant facilitating interactions, and found significant viral load decrease among 37 of 108 (34%) assessed pairs. Samples positive with SPn and a virus were consistently associated with increased SPn load.Co-circulating respiratory pathogens can interfere with or promote each other, leading to important effects on disease epidemiology. Estimating the magnitude of pathogen-pathogen interactions from clinical specimens is challenging because sampling from symptomatic individuals can create biased estimates.","1599":"The recurrent events joint model, which yielded higher hazard ratios of clinical malaria, was more precise and in most cases produced smaller standard errors than the single-event joint model; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.42, [95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.22, 2.03] vs. HR = 1.29, [95% CI:1.60, 2.45] among participants who reported not to use LLINs every night compared to those who used the nets every night; HR = 0.96, [ 95% CI: 0.94, 0.98] vs. HR = 0.81, [95% CI: 0.75, 0.88] for each 1-year increase in participants' age; and HR = 1.36, [95% CI: 1.05, 1.75] vs. HR = 1.10, [95% CI: 0.83, 4.11] for observations during the rainy season compared to the dry season.The recurrent events joint model in this study provides a way of estimating the risk of recurrent clinical malaria in a cohort where the effect of immunity on malaria disease acquired due to P. falciparum parasitemia with aging is captured. The simulation study has shown that if correctly specified, the recurrent events joint model can give risk estimates with low bias.The single event joint model comprised Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) sub-model for time-to-first clinical malaria episode and Negative Binomial (NB) mixed-effects sub-model for the longitudinal parasitemia. The recurrent events joint model extends the survival sub-model to a Gamma shared frailty model to include all recurrent clinical episodes. The models were applied to cohort data from Malawi. Simulations were also conducted to assess the performance of the model under different conditions.Recurrent clinical malaria episodes due to Plasmodium falciparum parasite infection are common in endemic regions. With each infection, acquired immunity develops, making subsequent disease episodes less likely. To capture the effect of acquired immunity to malaria, it may be necessary to model recurrent clinical disease episodes jointly with P. falciparum parasitemia data. A joint model of longitudinal parasitemia and time-to-first clinical malaria episode (single-event joint model) may be inaccurate because acquired immunity is lost when subsequent episodes are excluded. This study's informativeness assessed whether joint modeling of recurrent clinical malaria episodes and parasitemia is more accurate than a single-event joint model where the subsequent episodes are ignored.","1600":"50 years after a noble but flawed attempt to eradicate malaria in the mid-20th century, the global malaria community is once again seriously considering eradication. Momentum towards eradication has been building for decades, and more than half of the world's countries are now malaria free. Since 2000, a surge of global progress has occurred, facilitated by the roll-out of new technologies and the substantial growth in political and financial commitment by countries, regions, and their global partners. Annual domestic and international spending on malaria increased from roughly US$1\u00b75 billion in 2000 to $4\u00b73 billion in 2016. Simultaneously, the number of countries with endemic malaria dropped from 106 to 86, the worldwide annual incidence rate of malaria declined by 36%, and the annual death rate declined by 60%.","1601":"Measles-rubella supplementary immunization activities (MR-SIAs) are conducted to address inequalities in coverage and fill population immunity gaps when routine immunization services fail to reach all children with two doses of a measles-containing vaccine (MCV). We used data from a post-campaign coverage survey in Zambia to measure the proportion of measles zero-dose and under-immunized children who were reached by the 2020 MR-SIA and identified reasons associated with persistent inequalities following the MR-SIA.Overall, 4640 children were enrolled in the nationwide coverage survey. Only 68.6% (95% CI: 66.7%, 70.6%) received MCV during the MR-SIA. The MR-SIA provided MCV1 to 4.2% (95% CI: 0.9%, 4.6%) and MCV2 to 6.3% (95% CI: 5.6%, 7.1%) of enrolled children, but 58.1% (95% CI: 59.8%, 62.8%) of children receiving the MR-SIA dose had received at least two prior MCV doses. Furthermore, 27.8% of measles zero-dose children were vaccinated through the MR-SIA. The MR-SIA reduced the proportion of measles zero-dose children from 15.1% (95% CI: 13.6%, 16.7%) to 10.9% (95% CI: 9.7%, 12.3%). Zero-dose and under-immunized children were more likely to miss MR-SIA doses (prevalence ratio (PR): 2.81; 95% CI: 1.80, 4.41 and 2.22; 95% CI: 1.21 and 4.07) compared to fully vaccinated children.Children between 9 and 59 months were enrolled in a nationally representative, cross-sectional, multistage stratified cluster survey in October 2021 to estimate vaccination coverage during the November 2020 MR-SIA. Vaccination status was determined by immunization card or through caregivers' recall. MR-SIA coverage and the proportion of measles zero-dose and under-immunized children reached by MR-SIA were estimated. Log-binomial models were used to assess risk factors for missing the MR-SIA dose.The MR-SIA reached more under-immunized children with MCV2 than measles zero-dose children with MCV1. However, improvement is needed to reach the remaining measles zero-dose children after SIA. One possible solution to address the inequalities in vaccination is to transition from nationwide non-selective SIAs to more targeted and selective strategies.","1602":"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), identified in China at the end of December 2019 and causing the disease COVID-19, has meanwhile led to outbreaks all over the globe with about 2.2 million confirmed cases and more than 150,000 deaths as of April 17, 2020. In view of most recent information on testing activity, we present here an update of our initial work. In this work, mathematical models have been developed to study the spread of COVID-19 among the population in Germany and to asses the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Systems of differential equations of SEIR type are extended here to account for undetected infections, as well as for stages of infections and age groups. The models are calibrated on data until April 5, data from April 6 to 14 are used for model validation. We simulate different possible strategies for the mitigation of the current outbreak, slowing down the spread of the virus and thus reducing the peak in daily diagnosed cases, the demand for hospitalization or intensive care units admissions, and eventually the number of fatalities. Our results suggest that a partial (and gradual) lifting of introduced control measures could soon be possible if accompanied by further increased testing activity, strict isolation of detected cases and reduced contact to risk groups.","1603":"A simulation model indicates that initiation of medications for opioid use disorder and linkage policies among detox patients in Massachusetts, USA could prevent fatal opioid overdoses in the opioid use disorder population and would be cost-effective from a healthcare sector perspective.Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are shown to reduce opioid use and the risk of overdose. People with opioid use disorder (OUD) who exit inpatient medically managed withdrawal programs (detox) without initiating MOUD and linking to outpatient care have high rates of overdose. While detox encounters provide a theoretical opportunity for MOUD initiation, this is not ubiquitous in the United States (US). We used simulation modeling to estimate the population-level health effects and cost-effectiveness of a policy encouraging MOUD initiation during inpatient detox encounters.budgetary impact to the Massachusetts healthcare sector, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), and total counts and percent differences of fatal overdoses prevented.Initiating MOUD in detox with perfect linkage to outpatient MOUD would reduce fatal overdoses by 4.1% (95% confidence interval: 2.3-5.9%), at an ICER of $55,576 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, compared with the standard of care. With moderate linkage, fatal overdoses would be reduced by 2.1% (95% confidence interval 1.2-3.1%) with an ICER of $78,526 per QALY gained, compared with standard of care. Budgetary increase to Massachusetts healthcare spending ranged from 0.5-1%.We employed a dynamic population state-transition model to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using detox programs as venues for initiating MOUD in Massachusetts, USA. We compared standard of care, where no detox patients initiate MOUD or link to outpatient MOUD providers, to strategies of offering MOUD to detox patients and linking those patients to outpatient MOUD.","1604":"Wastewater has emerged as a crucial tool for infectious disease surveillance, offering a valuable means to bridge the equity gap between underserved communities and larger urban municipalities. However, using wastewater surveillance in a predictive manner remains a challenge. In this study, we tested if detecting SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater can forecast outbreaks in rural communities. Under the CDC National Wastewater Surveillance program, we monitored the SARS-CoV-2 in the wastewater of five rural communities and a small city in Idaho (USA). We then used a particle filter method coupled with a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model to infer active case numbers using quantities of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. Our findings revealed that while high daily variations in wastewater viral load made real-time interpretation difficult, the SEIR model successfully factored out this noise, enabling accurate forecasts of the Omicron outbreak in five of the six towns shortly after initial increases in SARS-CoV-2 concentrations were detected in wastewater. The model predicted outbreaks with a lead time of 0 to 11 days (average of 6 days +\/- 4) before the surge in reported clinical cases. This study not only underscores the viability of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) in rural communities-a demographic often overlooked in WBE research-but also demonstrates the potential of advanced epidemiological modeling to enhance the predictive power of wastewater data. Our work paves the way for more reliable and timely public health guidance, addressing a critical gap in the surveillance of infectious diseases in rural populations.","1605":"COVID-19 vaccination is allowing a progressive release of restrictions worldwide. Using a mathematical model, we assess the impact of vaccination in Italy since December 27, 2020 and evaluate prospects for societal reopening after emergence of the Delta variant. We estimate that by June 30, 2021, COVID-19 vaccination allowed the resumption of about half of pre-pandemic social contacts. In absence of vaccination, the same number of cases is obtained by resuming only about one third of pre-pandemic contacts, with about 12,100 (95% CI: 6,600-21,000) extra deaths (+27%; 95% CI: 15-47%). Vaccination offset the effect of the Delta variant in summer 2021. The future epidemic trend is surrounded by substantial uncertainty. Should a pediatric vaccine (for ages 5 and older) be licensed and a coverage >90% be achieved in all age classes, a return to pre-pandemic society could be envisioned. Increasing vaccination coverage will allow further reopening even in absence of a pediatric vaccine.","1606":"Economic evidence is increasingly being used for informing health policies. However, the underlining principles of health economic analyses are not always fully understood by non-health economists, and inappropriate types of analyses, as well as inconsistent methodologies, may be being used for informing health policy decisions. In addition, there is a lack of open access information and methodological guidance targeted to public health professionals, particularly those based in low- and middle-income country (LMIC) settings. The objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive and accessible introduction to economic evaluations for public health professionals with a focus on LMIC settings. We cover the main principles underlining the most common types of full economic evaluations used in healthcare decision making in the context of priority setting (namely cost-effectiveness\/cost-utility analyses, cost-benefit analyses), and outline their key features, strengths and weaknesses. It is envisioned that this will help those conducting such analyses, as well as stakeholders that need to interpret their output, gain a greater understanding of these methods and help them select\/distinguish between the different approaches. In particular, we highlight the need for greater awareness of the methods used to place a monetary value on the health benefits of interventions, and the potential for such estimates to be misinterpreted. Specifically, the economic benefits reported are typically an approximation, summarising the health benefits experienced by a population monetarily in terms of individual preferences or potential productivity gains, rather than actual realisable or fiscal monetary benefits to payers or society.","1607":"Individuals exhibited highly consistent behavior across adjacent years, yet, across the complete extent of the longitudinal study, they were far more likely to repeat the earlier decision to vaccinate. Surprisingly, the results of the mathematical model suggest that individuals are better characterized as having a stable propensity to repeat their previous decisions rather than a stable propensity to vaccinate per se. Although most individuals had an extremely strong tendency to repeat the previous decision, some had a far weaker propensity to do so.This suggests that interventions intended to increase vaccination uptake might be most impactful for those individuals with only a weak tendency to vaccinate or not to vaccinate.Seasonal influenza vaccination is an important behavior with significant individual and public health consequences, yet fewer than half of individuals in the USA are vaccinated annually. To promote vaccination adherence, it is important to understand the factors that affect vaccination behavior.In this research, we focused on one such factor, an individual's vaccination history. We gathered longitudinal data to track and understand the relationship between an individual's vaccination history and their current behaviors.U.S. adults completed multiple surveys over an 8 year period, which asked about whether they had received the influenza vaccination during the previous flu season. We analyzed the data to determine the strength of the relationship between vaccination decisions across single-year and multiyear intervals. Additionally, we fitted two mathematical models to the data to determine whether individuals were better characterized as having a stable propensity to vaccinate or a stable propensity to repeat their previous decisions.","1608":"The Cycladic, the Minoan, and the Helladic (Mycenaean) cultures define the Bronze Age (BA) of Greece. Urbanism, complex social structures, craft and agricultural specialization, and the earliest forms of writing characterize this iconic period. We sequenced six Early to Middle BA whole genomes, along with 11 mitochondrial genomes, sampled from the three BA cultures of the Aegean Sea. The Early BA (EBA) genomes are homogeneous and derive most of their ancestry from Neolithic Aegeans, contrary to earlier hypotheses that the Neolithic-EBA cultural transition was due to massive population turnover. EBA Aegeans were shaped by relatively small-scale migration from East of the Aegean, as evidenced by the Caucasus-related ancestry also detected in Anatolians. In contrast, Middle BA (MBA) individuals of northern Greece differ from EBA populations in showing \u223c50% Pontic-Caspian Steppe-related ancestry, dated at ca. 2,600-2,000 BCE. Such gene flow events during the MBA contributed toward shaping present-day Greek genomes.","1609":"Tuberculosis is the primary infectious disease killer worldwide, with a growing threat from multidrug-resistant cases. Unfortunately, classic growth-based phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) remains difficult, costly, and time consuming, while current rapid molecular testing options are limited by the diversity of antimicrobial-resistant genotypes that can be detected at once. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) offers the opportunity for rapid, comprehensive DST without the time or cost burden of phenotypic tests and can provide useful information for global surveillance. As access to NGS expands, it will be important to ensure that results are communicated clearly, consistent, comparable between laboratories, and associated with clear guidance on clinical interpretation of results. In this viewpoint article, we summarize 2 expert workshops regarding a standardized report format, focusing on relevant variables, terminology, and required minimal elements for clinical and laboratory reports with a proposed standardized template for clinical reporting NGS results for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.","1610":" Both service and individual characteristics were associated with contraceptive use, suggesting the importance of coordination between efforts to improve access to services and social and behavior change interventions that address motivations, knowledge, and attitudes toward FP.","1611":"Abstract\r\nAim\r\nConservation planning and prioritization generally have focused on protecting taxa based on assessments of their long\u2010term persistence or on protecting habitats and sites with high species richness. An implicit assumption of these approaches is that species are equally different from each other. We propose metrics for conservation planning and prioritization that include consideration of differences among taxa in their functional characteristics to ensure long\u2010term maintenance of ecosystem functioning and services.\r\n\r\nInnovation\r\nWe define metrics of functional distinctiveness, irregularity and singularity for a species. Functional distinctiveness is the mean distance in trait space of a species to all other species in a community. Functional irregularity is the variation in the proportional distances of a focal species to all other species based on a Hill function. Functional singularity is the product of those two metrics. These metrics can be weighted based on proportional abundance, biomass or frequency of occurrence. The metrics can be used to prioritize particular species for conservation based on their functional characteristics or to identify functionally distinct priority areas for conservation using the mean functional distinctiveness, irregularity and singularity of a set of species in an area. The metrics can be compared to the species richness of that area, thereby identifying areas that might have low species richness, but whose species are especially functionally distinct, providing important information of conservation relevance.\r\n\r\nMain Conclusions\r\nApplying these metrics to data on the global distributions of parrots, we identified species that are not of current conservation concern because they are geographically widespread, but which might be prioritized due to their functional singularity (e.g., the scarlet macaw). We also identified areas that are species poor and not generally considered noteworthy for their parrot fauna, but that contain a fauna that is functionally singular (e.g., Chile). Together, these metrics broaden the criteria used for conservation prioritization.","1612":"We use Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data to evaluate the impact of random spatial displacements on analyses that involve assigning covariate values from ancillary areal and point feature data. We introduce a method to determine the maximum probability covariate (MPC), and compare this to the naive covariate (NC) selection method with respect to obtaining the true covariate of interest. The MPC selection method outperforms the NC selection method by increasing the probability that the correct covariate is chosen. Proposed guidelines also address how characteristics of ancillary areal and point features contribute to uncertainty in covariate assignment.","1613":"Mathematical modelling has played an important role in offering informed advice during the COVID-19 pandemic. In England, a cross government and academia collaboration generated medium-term projections (MTPs) of possible epidemic trajectories over the future 4-6 weeks from a collection of epidemiological models. In this article, we outline this collaborative modelling approach and evaluate the accuracy of the combined and individual model projections against the data over the period November 2021-December 2022 when various Omicron subvariants were spreading across England. Using a number of statistical methods, we quantify the predictive performance of the model projections for both the combined and individual MTPs, by evaluating the point and probabilistic accuracy. Our results illustrate that the combined MTPs, produced from an ensemble of heterogeneous epidemiological models, were a closer fit to the data than the individual models during the periods of epidemic growth or decline, with the 90% confidence intervals widest around the epidemic peaks. We also show that the combined MTPs increase the robustness and reduce the biases associated with a single model projection. Learning from our experience of ensemble modelling during the COVID-19 epidemic, our findings highlight the importance of developing cross-institutional multi-model infectious disease hubs for future outbreak control.","1614":"The role of balancing selection in maintaining genetic variation remains an open question in population genetics. Recent years have seen numerous studies identifying candidate loci potentially experiencing balancing selection, most predominantly in human populations. There are however numerous alternative evolutionary processes that may leave similar patterns of variation, thereby potentially confounding inference, and the expected signatures of balancing selection additionally change in a temporal fashion. Here we use forward-in-time simulations to quantify expected statistical power to detect balancing selection using both site frequency spectrum (SFS)- and linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based methods under a variety of evolutionarily realistic null models. We find that whilst SFS-based methods have little power immediately after a balanced mutation begins segregating, power increases with time since the introduction of the balanced allele. Conversely, LD-based methods have considerable power whilst the allele is young, and power dissipates rapidly as the time since introduction increases. Taken together, this suggests that SFS-based methods are most effective at detecting long-term balancing selection (>25N generations since the introduction of the balanced allele) whilst LD-based methods are effective over much shorter timescales (<1N generations), thereby leaving a large time frame over which current methods have little power to detect the action of balancing selection. Finally, we investigate the extent to which alternative evolutionary processes may mimic these patterns, and demonstrate the need for caution in attempting to distinguish the signatures of balancing selection from those of both neutral processes (e.g., population structure and admixture) as well as of alternative selective processes (e.g., partial selective sweeps).","1615":"The projected trajectory of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) epidemics depends on the reproductive fitness of circulating strains of MDR M. tuberculosis (Mtb). Previous efforts to characterize the fitness of MDR Mtb have found that Mtb strains of the Beijing sublineage (Lineage 2.2.1) may be more prone to develop resistance and retain fitness in the presence of resistance-conferring mutations than other lineages. Using Mtb genome sequences from all culture-positive cases collected over two years in Moldova, we estimate the fitness of Ural (Lineage 4.2) and Beijing strains, the two lineages in which MDR is concentrated in the country. We estimate that the fitness of MDR Ural strains substantially exceeds that of other susceptible and MDR strains, and we identify several mutations specific to these MDR Ural strains. Our findings suggest that MDR Ural Mtb has been transmitting efficiently in Moldova and poses a substantial risk of spreading further in the region.","1616":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is endemic in people who inject drugs (PWID), with prevalence estimates above 60% for PWID in the United States. Previous modeling studies suggest that direct acting antiviral (DAA) treatment can lower overall prevalence in this population, but treatment is often delayed until the onset of advanced liver disease (fibrosis stage 3 or later) due to cost. Lower cost interventions featuring syringe access (SA) and medically assisted treatment (MAT) have shown mixed results in lowering HCV rates below current levels. However. little is known about the potential cumulative effects of combining DAA and MAT treatment. While simulation experiments can reveal likely long-term effects, most prior simulations have been performed on closed populations of model agents-a scenario quite different from the open, mobile populations known to most health agencies. This paper uses data from the Centers for Disease Control's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance project, IDU round 3, collected in New York City in 2012 to parameterize simulations of open populations. To test the effect of combining DAA treatment with SA\/MAT participation, multiple, scaled implementations of the two intervention strategies were simulated. Our results show that, in an open population, SA\/MAT by itself has only small effects on HCV prevalence, while DAA treatment by itself can lower both HCV and HCV-related advanced liver disease prevalence. More importantly, the simulation experiments suggest that combinations of the two strategies can, when implemented together and at sufficient levels, dramatically reduce HCV incidence. We conclude that adopting SA\/MAT implementations alongside DAA interventions can play a critical role in reducing the long-term consequences of ongoing HCV infection.","1617":"CRD42018099008.The protocol was designed and will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P). The protocol will include randomized controlled trials that assess the effect of interventions based on mobile phones for the prevention of STIs\/HIV. The interventions of interest will be those targeting mobile phone users and should consist of providing information by mobile phone through any function or application that can be used or sent to, and that has been designed to educate, promote or modify sexual behaviors and prevent STIs, including HIV. The data sources to identify these studies will be the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE and MEDLINE. The risk of bias will be assessed using the tool recommended by Cochrane. Finally, a meta-analysis will be done and data will be presented following the GRADE method.This research was exempted by the Ethics Committee of Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile (ID 171128002).Sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, are an important public health problem. Every day, over one million persons become infected with a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Health systems are searching for solutions to improve sex education and change the sexual behavior of people in order to prevent them. In public health, digital interventions based on mobile health technologies (M-health), especially those based on mobile phones, might be a crucial tool for the prevention of STIs and HIV. This systematic will review and summarize the evidence on the effectiveness of mobile phone-based interventions for the prevention of STIs and HIV.","1618":"Like humans, animals use plants and other materials as medication against parasites. Recent decades have shown that the study of insects can greatly advance our understanding of medication behaviors. The ease of rearing insects under laboratory conditions has enabled controlled experiments to test critical hypotheses, while their spectrum of reproductive strategies and living arrangements - ranging from solitary to eusocial communities - has revealed that medication behaviors can evolve to maximize inclusive fitness through both direct and indirect fitness benefits. Studying insects has also demonstrated in some cases that medication can act through modulation of the host's innate immune system and microbiome. We highlight outstanding questions, focusing on costs and benefits in the context of inclusive host fitness.","1619":" Given the limited understanding of prolapse development, more research is needed to quantify the microstructure of the pelvic organs and pelvic support structures, with and without prolapse. Identifying biomechanical properties in multiaxial configurations will improve our understanding of pelvic tissue support, as well as our ability to establish predictive models and improve clinical treatment strategies.","1620":"Pertussis, which is caused by Bordetella pertussis, has plagued humans for at least 800\u2009years, is highly infectious and can be fatal in the unvaccinated, especially very young infants. Although the rollout of whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccines in the 1940s and 1950s was associated with a drastic drop in incidence, concerns regarding the reactogenicity of wP vaccines led to the development of a new generation of safer, acellular (aP) vaccines that have been adopted mainly in high-income countries. Over the past 20\u2009years, some countries that boast high aP coverage have experienced a resurgence in pertussis, which has led to substantial debate over the basic immunology, epidemiology and evolutionary biology of the bacterium. Controversy surrounds the duration of natural immunity and vaccine-derived immunity, the ability of vaccines to prevent transmission and severe disease, and the impact of evolution on evading vaccine immunity. Resolving these issues is made challenging by incomplete detection of pertussis cases, the absence of a serological marker of immunity, modest sequencing of the bacterial genome and heterogeneity in diagnostic methods of surveillance. In this Review, we lay out the complexities of contemporary pertussis and, where possible, propose a parsimonious explanation for apparently incongruous observations.","1621":" for the treated surface as a base case assumption. This single touch scenario was used to develop a generalizable model for estimating risks and comparing scenarios with and without treatment to more realistic multiple touch scenarios over time periods and with contact rates previously reported in the literature. The results of this study and understanding of product efficacy on risk reduction inform and broaden the range of risk management strategies for influenza A by demonstrating effective risk reduction associated with treating nonporous fomites that cannot be laundered at high temperatures.","1622":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is responsible for the new pandemic, which remains an important health and economic challenge worldwide. The causative agent is a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is similar to SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Adult infection with respiratory symptoms was considered in the beginning of the pandemic. Now, it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 infects children and other organs such as the gastrointestinal tract. SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cells through angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors as the main receptor expressed in various organs such as the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Studies on children and the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 do not completely explain the natural course of infection in children, and precisely how the GI tract is involved is not understood. The present article highlights the gastrointestinal manifestations and pathological findings in children with COVID-19. According to the evidence, SARS-CoV-2 infection is milder in children and may present different clinical symptoms from adults. Common clinical manifestations of pediatric COVID-19 include cough, fever, sore throat, malaise, fatigue, and GI symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Furthermore, liver and pancreatic enzymes may be elevated during the pediatric COVID-19 course. Asymptomatic children carriers are potential sources of infection for adults, especially elderly ones. Diagnosis, treatment, and isolation of children are the most effective ways to control the expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic.","1623":"A valuable metric in understanding local infectious disease dynamics is the local time-varying reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary local cases caused by each infected individual. Accurate estimation of this quantity requires distinguishing cases arising from local transmission from those imported from elsewhere. Realistically, we can expect identification of cases as local or imported to be imperfect. We study the propagation of such errors in estimation of the local time-varying reproduction number. In addition, we propose a Bayesian framework for estimation of the true local time-varying reproduction number when identification errors exist. And we illustrate the practical performance of our estimator through simulation studies and with outbreaks of COVID-19 in Hong Kong and Victoria, Australia.","1624":"Much of the world experiences influenza in yearly recurring seasons, particularly in temperate areas. These patterns can be considered repeatable if they occur predictably and consistently at the same time of year. In tropical areas, including southeast Asia, timing of influenza epidemics is less consistent, leading to a lack of consensus regarding whether influenza is repeatable. This study aimed to assess repeatability of influenza in Vietnam, with repeatability defined as seasonality that occurs at a consistent time of year with low variation. We developed a mathematical model incorporating parameters to represent periods of increased transmission and then fitted the model to data collected from sentinel hospitals throughout Vietnam as well as four temperate locations. We fitted the model for individual (sub)types of influenza as well as all combined influenza throughout northern, central, and southern Vietnam. Repeatability was evaluated through the variance of the timings of peak transmission. Model fits from Vietnam show high variance (sd = 64-179 days) in peak transmission timing, with peaks occurring at irregular intervals and throughout different times of year. Fits from temperate locations showed regular, annual epidemics in winter months, with low variance in peak timings (sd = 32-57 days). This suggests that influenza patterns are not repeatable or seasonal in Vietnam. Influenza prevention in Vietnam therefore cannot rely on anticipation of regularly occurring outbreaks.","1625":"Seasonal forcing and contact patterns are two key features of many disease dynamics that generate periodic patterns. Both features have not been ascertained deeply in the previous works. In this work, we develop and analyze a non-autonomous degree-based mean field network model within a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) framework. We assume that the disease transmission rate being periodic to study synergistic impacts of the periodic transmission and the heterogeneity of the contact network on the infection threshold and dynamics for seasonal diseases. We demonstrate both analytically and numerically that (1) the disease free equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is less than one; and (2) there exists a unique global periodic solution that both susceptible and infected individuals coexist if the basic reproduction number is larger than one. We apply our framework to Scale-free contact networks for the simulation. Our results show that heterogeneity in the contact networks plays an important role in accelerating disease spreading and increasing the amplitude of the periodic steady state solution. These results confirm the need to address factors that create periodic patterns and contact patterns in seasonal disease when making policies to control an outbreak.","1626":"The analysis was based on repeated cross-sectional contact survey data collected in a standardized international study from 21 European countries between March 2020 and March 2022. We calculated the mean daily contacts reported using a clustered bootstrap by country and by settings (at home, at work, or in other settings). Where data were available, contact rates during the study period were compared with rates recorded prior to the pandemic. We fitted censored individual-level generalized additive mixed models to examine the effects of various factors on the number of social contacts.Our study, coordinated at the regional level, provides important insights into the understanding of the factors associated with social contacts to support future infectious disease outbreak responses.The survey recorded 463,336 observations from 96,456 participants. In all countries where comparison data were available, contact rates over the previous two years were substantially lower than those seen prior to the pandemic (approximately from over 10 to\u2009<\u20095), predominantly due to fewer contacts outside the home. Government restrictions imposed immediate effect on contacts, and these effects lingered after the restrictions were lifted. Across countries, the relationships between national policy, individual perceptions, or personal circumstances determining contacts varied.Most countries have enacted some restrictions to reduce social contacts to slow down disease transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic. For nearly two years, individuals likely also adopted new behaviours to avoid pathogen exposure based on personal circumstances. We aimed to understand the way in which different factors affect social contacts - a critical step to improving future pandemic responses.","1627":"The uptake of COVID-19 vaccines remains low despite their high effectiveness. Epidemic models that represent decision-making psychology can provide insight into the potential impact of vaccine promotion interventions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We coupled a network-based mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Georgia, USA with a social-psychological vaccination decision-making model in which vaccine side effects, post-vaccination infections, and other unidentified community-level factors could \"nudge\" individuals towards vaccine resistance while hospitalization spikes could nudge them towards willingness. Combining an increased probability of hospitalization-prompted resistant-to-willing switches with a decreased probability of willing-to-resistant switches prompted by unidentified community-level factors increased vaccine uptake and decreased SARS-CoV-2 incidence by as much as 30.7% and 24.0%, respectively. The latter probability had a greater impact than the former. This illustrates the disease prevention potential of vaccine promotion interventions that address community-level factors influencing decision-making and anticipate the case curve instead of reacting to it.","1628":"Self-reported lifetime nonmedical prescription opioid use.To report the prevalence of and risk factors associated with lifetime nonmedical prescription opioid use in a high-risk community sample of transgender adolescent girls and young women who are sexually active.Among 297 transgender adolescent girls and young women (mean [SD] age, 23.4 [3.5] years), 145 (48.8%) identified as non-Hispanic\/Latinx black, 76 (25.6%) identified as non-Hispanic\/Latinx white, 37 (12.5%) identified as Hispanic\/Latinx, 7 (2.4%) identified as non-Hispanic\/Latinx Asian, and 32 (10.8%) identified as multiracial or other race\/ethnicity. Thirty-five participants (11.8%) reported lifetime nonmedical prescription opioid use. Young transgender women who smoked cigarettes monthly or less (adjusted odds ratio, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.10-13.89) and who smoked daily (adjusted odds ratio, 5.69; 95% CI, 1.87-17.33) had greater odds of nonmedical prescription opioid use compared with those who did not smoke. Additionally, participants who identified as a sexual orientation other than heterosexual, gay, lesbian, or bisexual had significantly greater odds of lifetime nonmedical prescription opioid use compared with those who identified as heterosexual (adjusted odds ratio, 3.69; 95% CI, 1.07-12.72).These findings suggest that transgender adolescent girls and young women have similar prevalence of lifetime nonmedical prescription opioid use compared with the US general population prevalence of 12.5%. These findings may serve as a call-to-action for public health surveillance studies and evidence-based interventions to be comprehensively tailored to examine and respond to specific trends of substance use, particularly opioid use disorder, among transgender populations.Nonmedical prescription opioid use is a pressing public health issue in the United States. Transgender youth, including adolescent girls and young women who were assigned male at birth and currently identify as women, female, transgender women, or another diverse gender identity along the transfeminine gender spectrum, are more likely than their cisgender peers to report illicit substance use and meet diagnostic criteria for substance use disorders. However, relatively little is known about the experiences of these populations in the current era of opioid addiction and misuse.This cross-sectional study used 2012 to 2015 baseline data from Project LifeSkills, a randomized clinical trial of a behavioral intervention to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition and transmission among a diverse sample of transgender adolescent girls and young women recruited from Boston, Massachusetts, and Chicago, Illinois. A total of 297 transgender girls and women aged 16 to 29 years who were sexually active were included in this analysis. Data were analyzed from June 2019 to August 2019.Transgender woman identification.","1629":"African swine fever (ASF) is considered the most impactful transboundary swine disease. In the absence of effective vaccines, control strategies are heavily dependent on mass depopulation and movement restrictions. Here we developed a nested multiscale model for the transmission of ASF, combining spatially explicit network model of animal movements with a deterministic compartmental model for the dynamics of two ASF strains within-pixels of 3 km \u00d7 3 km, amongst the pig population in one Brazilian state. The model outcomes are epidemic duration, number of secondary infected farms and pigs, and distance of ASF spread. The model also shows the spatial distribution of ASF epidemics. We analyzed quarantine-based control interventions in the context of mortality trigger thresholds for the deployment of control strategies. The mean epidemic duration of a moderately virulent strain was 11.2 days assuming the first infection is detected (best-case scenario) and 15.9 days when detection is triggered at 10 % mortality. For a highly virulent strain, the epidemic duration was 6.5 days and 13.1 days, respectively. The distance from the source to infected locations and the spatial distribution was not dependent on strain virulence. Under the best-case scenario, we projected an average number of infected farms of 23.77 farms and 18.8 farms for the moderate and highly virulent strains, respectively. At 10% mortality-trigger, the predicted number of infected farms was on average 46.27 farms and 42.96 farms, respectively. We also demonstrated that the establishment of ring quarantine zones regardless of size (i.e., 5 km, 15 km) was outperformed by backward animal movement tracking. The proposed modeling framework provides an evaluation of ASF epidemic potential, providing a ranking of quarantine-based control strategies that could assist animal health authorities in planning the national preparedness and response plan.

This study assesses the antimicrobial resistance prevalence and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) trends in S. pseudintermedius (n=1804) isolated from canine skin samples at the Cornell University Animal Health Diagnostic Center (AHDC) between 2007 and 2020. Not susceptible (NS) prevalence, Cochran-Armitage tests, logrank tests, MIC50 and MIC90 quantiles, and survival analysis models were used to evaluate resistance prevalence and temporal trends to 23 antimicrobials. We use splines as predictors in accelerated failure time (AFT) models to model non-linear temporal trends in MICs. Multidrug resistance was common among isolates (47%), and isolates had moderate to high NS prevalence to the beta-lactams, chloramphenicol, the fluoroquinolones, gentamicin, the macrolides\/lincosamides, the tetracyclines, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. However, low levels of NS to amikacin, rifampin, and vancomycin were observed. Around one third of isolates (38%) were found to be methicillin resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP), and these isolates had a higher prevalence of NS to all tested antimicrobials than methicillin susceptible isolates. Amongst the MRSP isolates, one phenotypically vancomycin resistant isolate (MIC >16\u202f\u00b5g\/mL) was identified, but genomic sequence data was unavailable. AFT models showed increasing MICs across time to the beta-lactams, chloramphenicol, the fluoroquinolones, gentamicin, and the macrolides\/lincosamides, and decreasing temporal resistance (decreasing MICs) to doxycycline was observed amongst isolates. Notably, ATF modeling showed changes in MIC distributions that were not identified using Cochran-Armitage tests on prevalence, MIC quantiles, and logrank tests. Increasing resistance amongst these S. pseudintermedius isolates highlights the need for rational, empirical prescribing practices and increased antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance to maintain the efficacy of current therapeutic agents. AFT models with non-linear predictors may be a useful, breakpoint-independent, surveillance tool alongside other modeling methods and antibiograms.","1631":"Despite repeated spillover transmission and their potential to cause significant morbidity and mortality in human hosts, the New World mammarenaviruses remain largely understudied. These viruses are endemic to South America, with animal reservoir hosts covering large geographic areas and whose transmission ecology and spillover potential are driven in part by land use change and agriculture that put humans in regular contact with zoonotic hosts.We compiled published studies about Guanarito virus, Junin virus, Machupo virus, Chapare virus, Sabia virus, and Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis virus to review the state of knowledge about the viral hemorrhagic fevers caused by New World mammarenaviruses. We summarize what is known about rodent reservoirs, the conditions of spillover transmission for each of these pathogens, and the characteristics of human populations at greatest risk for hemorrhagic fever diseases. We also review the implications of repeated outbreaks and biosecurity concerns where these diseases are endemic, and steps that countries can take to strengthen surveillance and increase capacity of local healthcare systems. While there are unique risks posed by each of these six viruses, their ecological and epidemiological similarities suggest common steps to mitigate spillover transmission and better contain future outbreaks.","1632":"Dengue has been estimated to cause a substantial health and economic burden in Vietnam. The most recent studies have estimated that it is responsible for 39884 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) annually, representing an economic burden of US$94.87 million per year (in 2016 prices). However, there are alternative burden estimates that are notably lower. This variation is predominantly due to differences in how the number of symptomatic dengue cases is estimated. Understanding the methodology of these burden calculations is vital when interpreting health economic analyses of dengue. This review aims to provide an overview of the health and economic burden estimates of dengue in Vietnam. We also highlight important research gaps for future studies.","1633":"Multiple candidate vaccines to prevent COVID-19 have entered large-scale phase 3 placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials, and several have demonstrated substantial short-term efficacy. At some point after demonstration of substantial efficacy, placebo recipients should be offered the efficacious vaccine from their trial, which will occur before longer-term efficacy and safety are known. The absence of a placebo group could compromise assessment of longer-term vaccine effects. However, by continuing follow-up after vaccination of the placebo group, this study shows that placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy can be mathematically derived by assuming that the benefit of vaccination over time has the same profile for the original vaccine recipients and the original placebo recipients after their vaccination. Although this derivation provides less precise estimates than would be obtained by a standard trial where the placebo group remains unvaccinated, this proposed approach allows estimation of longer-term effect, including durability of vaccine efficacy and whether the vaccine eventually becomes harmful for some. Deferred vaccination, if done open-label, may lead to riskier behavior in the unblinded original vaccine group, confounding estimates of long-term vaccine efficacy. Hence, deferred vaccination via blinded crossover, where the vaccine group receives placebo and vice versa, would be the preferred way to assess vaccine durability and potential delayed harm. Deferred vaccination allows placebo recipients timely access to the vaccine when it would no longer be proper to maintain them on placebo, yet still allows important insights about immunologic and clinical effectiveness over time.","1634":"Currently there are a number of coalescent simulation programs that support a wide range of features, such as arbitrary demographic models, migration, and sub structure. Defining the model is done typically with either text files or command line switches. Although this has proven to be a powerful method of defining models of high complexity, it is often error prone and difficult to read without familiarity both with command lines and the program in question. A intuitive GUI based population structure program that can both read and write applicable command lines would dramatically simplify the construction, modification, and error checking of such models by a wider user base.PopPlanner is a tool to both construct and inspect complicated demographic models visually with a GUI where the user's primary interaction is through mouse gestures. Because of their popularity, we focus on ms and by extension msms, command line coalescent simulation programs. Our program can be used to find errors with existing command lines, or to build original command lines. Furthermore, the graphical output supports a number of editing and output features including export of publication quality figures.","1635":"Commonly used drawing tools for interactive image segmentation and labeling include active contours or boundaries, scribbles, rectangles and other shapes. Thin vessel shapes in images of vascular networks are difficult to segment using automatic or interactive methods. This paper introduces the novel use of a sparse set of user-defined seed points (supervised labels) for precisely, quickly and robustly segmenting complex biomedical images. A multiquadric spline-based binary classifier is proposed as a unique approach for interactive segmentation using as features color values and the location of seed points. Epifluorescence imagery of the dura mater microvasculature are difficult to segment for quantitative applications due to challenging tissue preparation, imaging conditions, and thin, faint structures. Experimental results based on twenty epifluorescence images is used to illustrate the benefits of using a set of seed points to obtain fast and accurate interactive segmentation compared to four interactive and automatic segmentation approaches.","1636":"We introduced a new methodology to rank individuals for surveillance in temporal networks, which was more practical than the static networks. By targeting previously infected nodes, this method used readily available EHR data instead of the contact-network structure.We validated this method qualitatively in a real-world cohort study and evaluated our approach quantitatively by comparing it to other surveillance methods on three temporal and empirical networks. We found that, despite not explicitly exploiting the contacts' network structure, it remained the best or close to the best strategy. We related the performance of the method to the public health goals, the reproduction number of the disease, and the underlying temporal-network structure (e.g., burstiness).The ease of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) non-pharmacological interventions and the increased susceptibility during the past COVID-19 pandemic could be a precursor for the resurgence of influenza, potentially leading to a severe outbreak in the winter of 2022 and future seasons. The recent increased availability of data on Electronic Health Records (EHR) in public health systems, offers new opportunities to monitor individuals to mitigate outbreaks.The proposed strategy of using historical records for sentinel surveillance selection can be taken as a practical and robust alternative without the knowledge of individual contact behaviors for public health policymakers.","1637":"Using an individual-based model (IBM), we reproduced methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonisation transmission dynamics over a detailed contact network recorded within a French LTCF of 327 patients and 263 staff over 3 months. Simulated baseline cumulative colonisation incidence was 21 patients (prediction interval: 11, 31) and 35 staff (prediction interval: 19, 54). We examined the potential impact of 3 types of interventions against transmission (reallocation reducing the number of unique contacts per staff, reinforced contact precautions, and hypothetical vaccination protecting against acquisition), targeted towards specific populations. All 3 interventions were effective when applied to all nurses or healthcare assistants (median reduction in MRSA colonisation incidence up to 35%), but the benefit did not exceed 8% when targeting any other single staff category. We identified \"supercontactor\" individuals with most contacts (\"frequency-based,\" overrepresented among nurses, porters, and rehabilitation staff) or with the longest cumulative time spent in contact (\"duration-based,\" overrepresented among healthcare assistants and patients in elderly care or persistent vegetative state (PVS)). Targeting supercontactors enhanced interventions against pathogen spread in the LTCF. With contact precautions, targeting frequency-based staff supercontactors led to the highest incidence reduction (20%, 95% CI: 19, 21). Vaccinating a mix of frequency- and duration-based staff supercontactors led to a higher reduction (23%, 95% CI: 22, 24) than all other approaches. Although based on data from a single LTCF, when varying epidemiological parameters to extend to other pathogens, our results suggest that targeting supercontactors is always the most effective strategy, indicating this approach could be applied to prevent transmission of other nosocomial pathogens.Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are hotspots for pathogen transmission. Infection control interventions are essential, but the high density and heterogeneity of interindividual contacts within LTCF may hinder their efficacy. Here, we explore how the patient-staff contact structure may inform effective intervention implementation.By characterising the contact structure in hospital settings and identifying the categories of staff and patients more likely to be supercontactors, with either more or longer contacts than others, interventions against nosocomial spread could be more effective. We find that the most efficient implementation strategy depends on the intervention (reallocation, contact precautions, vaccination) and target population (staff, patients, supercontactors). Importantly, both staff and patients may be supercontactors, highlighting the importance of including patients in measures to prevent pathogen transmission in LTCF.","1638":"In the United States, schools closed in March 2020 due to COVID-19 and began reopening in August 2020, despite continuing transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In states where in-person instruction resumed at that time, two major unknowns were the capacity at which schools would operate, which depended on the proportion of families opting for remote instruction, and adherence to face-mask requirements in schools, which depended on cooperation from students and enforcement by schools. To determine the impact of these conditions on the statewide burden of COVID-19 in Indiana, we used an agent-based model calibrated to and validated against multiple data types. Using this model, we quantified the burden of COVID-19 on K-12 students, teachers, their families, and the general population under alternative scenarios spanning three levels of school operating capacity (50 %, 75 %, and 100 %) and three levels of face-mask adherence in schools (50 %, 75 %, and 100 %). Under a scenario in which schools operated remotely, we projected 45,579 (95 % CrI: 14,109-132,546) infections and 790 (95 % CrI: 176-1680) deaths statewide between August 24 and December 31. Reopening at 100 % capacity with 50 % face-mask adherence in schools resulted in a proportional increase of 42.9 (95 % CrI: 41.3-44.3) and 9.2 (95 % CrI: 8.9-9.5) times that number of infections and deaths, respectively. In contrast, our results showed that at 50 % capacity with 100 % face-mask adherence, the number of infections and deaths were 22 % (95 % CrI: 16 %-28 %) and 11 % (95 % CrI: 5 %-18 %) higher than the scenario in which schools operated remotely. Within this range of possibilities, we found that high levels of school operating capacity (80-95 %) and intermediate levels of face-mask adherence (40-70 %) resulted in model behavior most consistent with observed data. Together, these results underscore the importance of precautions taken in schools for the benefit of their communities.","1639":"Two mass azithromycin administrations, 6 months apart, in preschool children led to long-term alterations of the gut microbiome structure and community diversity. Here, long-term microbial alterations in the community did not imply disease but were associated with an improvement in childhood mortality.NCT02048007.Mass distributions of oral azithromycin have long been used to eliminate trachoma, and they are now being proposed to reduce childhood mortality. The observed benefit appears to be augmented with each additional treatment, suggesting a possible community-level effect. Here, we assess whether 2 biannual mass treatments of preschool children affect the community's gut microbiome at 6 months after the last distribution.In this cluster-randomized controlled trial, children aged 1-60 months in the Dossa region of Niger were randomized at the village level to receive a single dose of azithromycin or placebo every 6 months. Fecal samples were collected 6 months after the second treatment for metagenomic deep sequencing. The prespecified primary outcome was the Euclidean PERMANOVA of the gut microbiome, or effectively the distance between the genus-level centroid at the community level, with the secondary outcome being the Simpson's \u03b1 diversity.In the azithromycin arm, the gut microbial structures were significantly different than in the placebo arm (Euclidean PERMANOVA, P < .001). Further, the diversity of the gut microbiome in the azithromycin arm was significantly lower than in the placebo arm (inverse Simpson's index, P = .005).","1640":"We estimated two of the most influential entomological variables related to cumulative vectorial\u00a0capacity, which is a modification of the traditional vectorial capacity equation, of three Colombian\u00a0mosquito populations. Laboratory studies were undertaken to measure vector competence and man biting\u00a0rate of local mosquito populations. In addition, the assessment of cumulative vectorial capacity also incorporated\u00a0site-specific estimations of mosquito density and the probability of daily survival from previous\u00a0studies conducted in those cities.We aimed to determine the utility of vectorial capacity to explain the observed dengue infection\u00a0rates in three hyperendemic cities in Colombia, and tested hypotheses related to three variables: mosquito density, effective vector competence, and biting rate.Specific mosquito-biting rate is likely sufficient to explain transmission differences in these three cities, confirming that this parameter is a critical parameter when predicting and assessing dengue transmission in three Colombian cities with different field observed transmission patterns.Measuring dengue virus transmission in endemic areas is a difficult task as many variables drive transmission, and often are not independent of one another.We found that the biting rates and mosquito infection rates differed among populations of mosquitoes from these three cities, resulting in differences in the site-specific measures of transmission\u00a0potential. Specifically, we found that using site-specific entomological measures to populate the cumulative\u00a0vectorial capacity equation was best at recapitulating observed mosquito infection rates when mosquito density was discounted compared to when we incorporated site-specific density measures.","1641":"Computational social science is more than just large repositories of digital data and the computational methods needed to construct and analyse them. It also represents a convergence of different fields with different ways of thinking about and doing science. The goal of this Perspective is to provide some clarity around how these approaches differ from one another and to propose how they might be productively integrated. Towards this end we make two contributions. The first is a schema for thinking about research activities along two dimensions-the extent to which work is explanatory, focusing on identifying and estimating causal effects, and the degree of consideration given to testing predictions of outcomes-and how these two priorities can complement, rather than compete with, one another. Our second contribution is to advocate that computational social scientists devote more attention to combining prediction and explanation, which we call integrative modelling, and to outline some practical suggestions for realizing this goal.","1642":"We use an agent-based model to study the spread of influenza in Delhi through person-to-person contact. Two different networks are used: one in which slum and non-slum regions are treated the same, and the other in which 298 slum zones are identified. In the second network, slum-specific demographics and activities are assigned to the individuals whose homes reside inside these zones. The main effects of integrating slums are that the network has more home-related contacts due to larger family sizes and more outside contacts due to more daily activities outside home. Various vaccination and social distancing interventions are applied to control the spread of influenza.Simulation-based results show that when slum attributes are ignored, the effectiveness of vaccination can be overestimated by 30%-55%, in terms of reducing the peak number of infections and the size of the epidemic, and in delaying the time to peak infection. The slum population sustains greater infection rates under all intervention scenarios in the network that treats slums differently. Vaccination strategy performs better than social distancing strategies in slums.This research studies the role of slums in the spread and control of infectious diseases in the National Capital Territory of India, Delhi, using detailed social contact networks of its residents.Unique characteristics of slums play a significant role in the spread of infectious diseases. Modelling slums and estimating their impact on epidemics will help policy makers and regulators more accurately prioritise allocation of scarce medical resources and implement public health policies.","1643":"The accuracy of a diagnostic test has always been essential in detecting disease staging. Many diagnostic tests of accuracy measures are used in binary diagnosis tests. Some measures apply to multi-stage diagnosis. Yet, there are limitations to the implementation, and the performance highly depends on the distribution of diagnostic outcomes. Another essential aspect of medical diagnostic testing using biomarkers is to find an optimal cut-point that categorizes a patient as diseased or healthy. This aspect was extended to the diseases with more than two stages. We propose a diagnostic accuracy measure and optimal cut-points selection (CD), using concordance and discordance for k-stages diseases. The CD measure uses the classification agreement and disagreement between tests outcomes and diseases stages. Simulations for power studies suggest that CD can detect the differences between the null and alternative hypotheses that other methods cannot for some scenarios. Simulation results indicate that using CD measures to select optimal cut-points can provide relatively high correct classification rates than the existing measures and more balanced accurate classification rates than the generalized Youden Index (GYI). An illustration is provided using the ANDI data to choose biomarkers for diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and select optimal cut-points for the chosen biomarkers.","1644":"Understanding the risk factors for breakthrough coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (BC19) is critical to inform policy. Herein, we assessed Delta (Lineage B.1.617.2) variant-specific effectiveness of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine and characterized Delta-driven BC19 cases (fully vaccinated individuals who get infected) with known-time-since-vaccination. In this longitudinal prospective study (January 21-October 30, 2021), 90 na\u00efve and 15 convalescent individuals were enrolled at the initiation of vaccination. Samples from 27 unvaccinated individuals with previous laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were collected at a single time point. Longitudinal serology profile (antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] S and N proteins) and live-virus-based neutralization capacities were assessed while controlling for age. Sex, age, history of reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine, and viral neutralization capacities were identified as significant risk factors for breakthrough COVID-19. At 8 months postvaccination, male sex, individuals \u2a7e65 years of age, and individuals who experienced noticeable side effects with the COVID-19 vaccine were at 5.47 (p-value = 0.0102), 4.33 (p-value = 0.0236), and 4.95 (p-value = 0.0159) fold greater risk of BC19 as compared to their peers, respectively. Importantly, every five-fold increase in viral neutralization capacities (by live-virus-based assays) was significantly associated with ~4-fold reduction in the risk occurrence of breakthrough COVID-19 (p-value = 0.045). Vaccine boosting remarkably increased these viral neutralization capacities by 16.22-fold (p- value = 0.0005), supporting the importance of the BNT162b2 booster in efforts to control the incursion of future variants into the population at large. Strikingly, BC19 cases exhibited a delayed\/absent antibody response to the N protein, suggesting limited exposure to the virus. Since antibodies against N protein are widely used to evaluate the extent of virus spread in communities, our finding has important implications on the utility of existing serological diagnostic and surveillance for COVID-19.","1645":"The basic reproductive number, R0, is one of the most common and most commonly misapplied numbers in public health. Often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that different epidemics can exhibit, even when they have the same R0. Here, we reformulate and extend a classic result from random network theory to forecast the size of an epidemic using estimates of the distribution of secondary infections, leveraging both its average R0 and the underlying heterogeneity. Importantly, epidemics with lower R0 can be larger if they spread more homogeneously (and are therefore more robust to stochastic fluctuations). We illustrate the potential of this approach using different real epidemics with known estimates for R0, heterogeneity and epidemic size in the absence of significant intervention. Further, we discuss the different ways in which this framework can be implemented in the data-scarce reality of emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19 the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond R0.","1646":" genomes.

Here, we present a Bayesian hierarchical model that jointly estimates the genomic RNA viral load, the subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) viral load (correlated to active viral replication), and the rate and timing of seroconversion (correlated to presence of antibodies). Our proposed method accounts for the dynamical relationship and correlation structure between the two types of viral load, allows for borrowing of information between viral load and antibody data, and identifies potential correlates of viral load characteristics and propensity for seroconversion. We demonstrate the features of the joint model through application to the COVID-19 post-exposure prophylaxis study and conduct a cross-validation exercise to illustrate the model's ability to impute the sgRNA viral trajectories for people who only had genomic RNA viral load data.","1648":"West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging mosquito-borne pathogen in Europe where it represents a new public health threat. While climate change has been cited as a potential driver of its spatial expansion on the continent, a formal evaluation of this causal relationship is lacking. Here, we investigate the extent to which WNV spatial expansion in Europe can be attributed to climate change while accounting for other direct human influences such as land-use and human population changes. To this end, we trained ecological niche models to predict the risk of local WNV circulation leading to human cases to then unravel the isolated effect of climate change by comparing factual simulations to a counterfactual based on the same environmental changes but a counterfactual climate where long-term trends have been removed. Our findings demonstrate a notable increase in the area ecologically suitable for WNV circulation during the period 1901-2019, whereas this area remains largely unchanged in a no-climate-change counterfactual. We show that the drastic increase in the human population at risk of exposure is partly due to historical changes in population density, but that climate change has also been a critical driver behind the heightened risk of WNV circulation in Europe.","1649":"Computer simulation is the only method available for evaluating vaccination policy for rare diseases or emergency use of new vaccines. The most realistic simulation of vaccination policy is agent-based simulation (ABS) in which agents have similar socio-demographic characteristics to a population of interest. Currently, analysts use published information about vaccine efficacy (VE) as the probability that a vaccinated agent develops immunity; however, VE trials typically report only a single overall VE, or VE conditioned on one covariate (e.g., age). Thus, ABS's potential to realistically simulate the effects of co-existing diseases, gender, and other characteristics of a population is underused. We developed a Bayesian network (BN) model as a compact representation of a VE trial dataset for use in ABS of vaccination policy. We compared BN-based VEs to the VEs estimated directly from the dataset. Our evaluation results suggest that VE trials should release statistical models of their datasets for use in ABS of vaccination policy.","1650":"Introduction of mask use with 50% efficacy worn by 50% of individuals reduces the cumulative infection attack rate (IAR) by 27%, the peak prevalence by 49%, and population-wide mortality by 29%. If 90% of individuals wear 50% efficacious masks, this decreases IAR by 54%, peak prevalence by 75%, and population-wide mortality by 55%; similar improvements hold if 70% of individuals wear 75% efficacious masks. Late adoption reduces IAR and deaths by 18% or more compared to no adoption. Lower adoption in rural areas than urban would lead to rural areas having the highest IAR.To evaluate the effectiveness of widespread adoption of masks or face coverings to reduce community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.We created an agent-based stochastic network simulation using a variant of the standard SEIR dynamic infectious disease model. We considered a mask order that was initiated 3.5 months after the first confirmed COVID-19 case. We varied the likelihood of individuals wearing masks from 0-100% in steps of 20% (mask adherence) and considered 25% to 90% mask-related reduction in viral transmission (mask efficacy). Sensitivity analyses assessed early (by week 13) versus late (by week 42) adoption of masks and geographic differences in adherence (highest in urban and lowest in rural areas).Even after community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been established, adoption of mask-wearing by a majority of community-dwelling individuals can meaningfully reduce the number and outcome of COVID-19 infections over and above physical distancing interventions.","1651":"Results indicate ARIMA models can be applied to forecast malaria patterns in Afghanistan, complementing current surveillance systems. The models provide a means to better understand malaria dynamics in a resource-limited context with minimal data input, yielding forecasts that can be used for public health planning at the national level.Malaria remains endemic in Afghanistan. National control and prevention strategies would be greatly enhanced through a better ability to forecast future trends in disease incidence. It is, therefore, of interest to develop a predictive tool for malaria patterns based on the current passive and affordable surveillance system in this resource-limited region.This study employs data from Ministry of Public Health monthly reports from January 2005 to September 2015. Malaria incidence in Afghanistan was forecasted using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models in order to build a predictive tool for malaria surveillance. Environmental and climate data were incorporated to assess whether they improve predictive power of models.Two models were identified, each appropriate for different time horizons. For near-term forecasts, malaria incidence can be predicted based on the number of cases in the four previous months and 12 months prior (Model 1); for longer-term prediction, malaria incidence can be predicted using the rates 1 and 12 months prior (Model 2). Next, climate and environmental variables were incorporated to assess whether the predictive power of proposed models could be improved. Enhanced vegetation index was found to have increased the predictive accuracy of longer-term forecasts.","1652":"We observed a significant increase of F\/B ratio in the obese group, compared to the normal weight group (p = 0.002). Although A. muciniphila (p = 0.039) and Bifidobacterium (p = 0.049) abundance significantly decreased, the abundance of F. prausnitzii (p = 0.046) significantly elevated with BMI increase in the studied groups.Obesity is a complex disorder influenced by various genetic and environmental factors. It has been shown that gut microbiota, which colonizes gastrointestinal tract, has a substantial role as an environmental factor in the pathophysiology of obesity. Since the composition of gut microbiota alters with regard to different criteria, such as ethnicity, geographical location, diet, lifestyle, age, and gender, we aimed to determine firmicutes\/bacteroidetes (F\/B) ratio and the abundance of important gut microbiota members, Akkermansia muciniphila, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia, Bifidobacterium, and Prevotella in Iranian obese and normal weight individuals, for the first time.In this study, 50 normal and 50 obese subjects were recruited and classified based on their body mass index into normal weight and obese groups. Stool samples were collected. Following DNA extraction from the samples, quantitative PCR was conducted based on 16s rDNA universal primers. Finally, the correlation between the bacterial abundance and obesity was analyzed by statistical analyses.Owing to the importance of the gut microbiota composition in obesity development, determination and targeted restoration of gut microbiota pattern could be valuable in the control and treatment of obesity in certain populations.","1653":" these approaches work remains open. We addressed this question using Wikipedia access logs and category links. Our experiments, replicable and extensible using our open source code and data, test the effect of semantic article filtering, amount of training data, forecast horizon, and model staleness by comparing across 6 diseases and 4 countries using thousands of individual models. We found that our minimal-configuration, language-agnostic article selection process based on semantic relatedness is effective for improving predictions, and that our approach is relatively insensitive to the amount and age of training data. We also found, in contrast to prior work, very little forecasting value, and we argue that this is consistent with theoretical considerations about the nature of forecasting. These mixed results lead us to propose that the currently observational field of internet-based disease surveillance must pivot to include theoretical models of information flow as well as controlled experiments based on simulations of disease.","1654":"The transport of intracellular organelles is accomplished by groups of molecular motors, such as kinesin, myosin, and dynein. Previous studies have demonstrated that the cooperation between kinesins on a track is beneficial for long transport. However, within crowded three-dimensional (3D) cytoskeletal networks, surplus motors could impair transport and lead to traffic jams of cargos. Comprehensive understanding of the effects of the interactions among molecular motors, cargo, and tracks on the 3D cargo transport dynamics is still lack. In this work, a 3D stochastic multiphysics model is introduced to study the synergistic and antagonistic motions of kinesin motors walking on multiple mircotubules (MTs). Based on the model, we show that kinesins attaching to a common cargo can interact mechanically through the transient forces in their cargo linkers. Under different environmental conditions, such as different MT topologies and kinesin concentrations, the transient forces in the kinesins, the stepping frequency and the binding and unbinding probabilities of kinesins are changed substantially. Therefore, the macroscopic transport properties, specifically the stall force of the cargo, the transport direction at track intersections, and the mean-square displacement (MSD) of the cargo along the MT bundles vary over the environmental conditions. In general, conditions that improve the synergistic motion of kinesins increase the stall force of the cargo and the capability of maintaining the transport. In contrast, the antagonistic motion of kinesins temporarily traps the cargo and slows down the transport. Furthermore, this study predicts an optimal number of kinesins for the cargo transport at MT intersections and along MT bundles.","1655":"We used an individual-based simulation model to examine the role of phenotypic plasticity on persistence and adaptation to two patterns of environmental variation, a single, abrupt step change and continual, linear change. Our model tested the assumptions and predictions of the theory of genetic assimilation, explored the evolutionary dynamics of the Baldwin effect, and provided expectations for the evolutionary response to climate change. We found that genetic assimilation as originally postulated is not likely to occur because the replacement of plasticity by fixed genetic effects takes much longer than the environment is likely to remain stable. On the other hand, trait plasticity as an enhancement to continual evolutionary change may be an important evolutionary mechanism as long as plasticity has little or no costs. Whether or not plasticity helps or hinders evolutionary rescue following a step change in the environment depends on whether plasticity is costly. For linear environmental change, noncostly plasticity always decreases extinction rates, while costly plasticity can create a fitness drag and increase the chance of extinction. Thus, with changing climates plasticity can enhance adaptation and prevent extinction under some conditions, but not others.","1656":" are at high risk of mortality at public district hospitals in South Africa. Tuberculosis should be considered an additional risk factor for CDI in populations with high tuberculosis and HIV comorbidity. Interventions for CDI prevention and management are urgently needed. infection (CDI) in low-resource settings and settings with high prevalence of HIV. We aimed to determine baseline CDI patient characteristics and management and their contribution to mortality. risk factors (positive vs negative) and CDI treatment.positive (29%) patients were not treated.","1657":"Evolutionary computational methods have adopted attributes of natural selection and evolution to solve problems in computer science, engineering, and other fields. The method is growing in use in zoology and ecology. Evolutionary principles may be merged with an agent-based modeling perspective to have individual animals or other agents compete. Four main categories are discussed: genetic algorithms, evolutionary programming, genetic programming, and evolutionary strategies. In evolutionary computation, a population is represented in a way that allows for an objective function to be assessed that is relevant to the problem of interest. The poorest performing members are removed from the population, and remaining members reproduce and may be mutated. The fitness of the members is again assessed, and the cycle continues until a stopping condition is met. Case studies include optimizing: egg shape given different clutch sizes, mate selection, migration of wildebeest, birds, and elk, vulture foraging behavior, algal bloom prediction, and species richness given energy constraints. Other case studies simulate the evolution of species and a means to project shifts in species ranges in response to a changing climate that includes competition and phenotypic plasticity. This introduction concludes by citing other uses of evolutionary computation and a review of the flexibility of the methods. For example, representing species' niche spaces subject to selective pressure allows studies on cladistics, the taxon cycle, neutral versus niche paradigms, fundamental versus realized niches, community structure and order of colonization, invasiveness, and responses to a changing climate.","1658":"Norovirus is increasingly recognized as a major cause of acute gastroenteritis among children <5 years of age. We searched for publications that reported detailed age distributions of pediatric norovirus cases, and assessed associations between age distribution and socio-demographic factors to identify the most critical age periods to prevent norovirus cases among young children. Approximately 70% of pediatric norovirus cases occurred between 6 and 23 months of age. A younger age distribution was found in lower income countries and inpatient settings. These findings suggest that a norovirus immunization schedule completed by 6 months could have the potential to prevent about 85% of pediatric cases, while a vaccine delivered at 12 months of age would only have the potential to prevent about 50% of pediatric cases. With a younger age distribution in lower income settings, early prevention would be even more critical. ","1659":"We estimated the speed of Zika virus introduction in Brazil by using confirmed cases at the municipal level. Our models indicate a southward pattern of introduction starting from the northeastern coast and a pattern of movement toward the western border with an average speed of spread of 42 km\/day or 15,367 km\/year.","1660":"Urgently needed is a debiased spatiotemporal characterization of mask-wearing behavior in the U.S. This information is critical to further assess the effectiveness of masking, evaluate drivers of transmission at different time points during the pandemic, and guide future public health decisions through, for example, forecasting disease surges.We analyze spatiotemporal masking patterns in over eight million behavioral survey responses from across the United States starting in September 2020 through May 2021. We adjust for sample size and representation using binomial regression models and survey raking, respectively, to produce county-level monthly estimates of masking behavior. We additionally debias self-reported masking estimates using bias measures derived by comparing vaccination data from the same survey to official records at the county-level. Lastly, we evaluate whether individuals' perceptions of their social environment can serve as a less biased form of behavioral surveillance than self-reported data.Our work highlights the importance of characterizing public health behaviors at fine spatiotemporal scales to capture heterogeneities that may drive outbreak trajectories. Our findings also emphasize the need for a standardized approach to incorporating behavioral big data into public health response efforts. Even large surveys are prone to bias; thus, we advocate for a social sensing approach to behavioral surveillance to enable more accurate estimates of health behaviors. Finally, we invite the public health and behavioral research communities to use our publicly available estimates to consider how bias-corrected behavioral estimates may improve our understanding of protective behaviors during crises and their impact on disease dynamics.Face mask-wearing has been identified as an effective strategy to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, yet mask mandates were never imposed nationally in the United States. This decision resulted in a patchwork of local policies and varying compliance potentially generating heterogeneities in the local trajectories of COVID-19 in the U.S. While numerous studies have investigated patterns and predictors of masking behavior nationally, most suffer from survey biases and none have been able to characterize mask-wearing at fine spatial scales across the U.S. through different phases of the pandemic.We find that county-level masking behavior is spatially heterogeneous along an urban-rural gradient, with mask-wearing peaking in winter 2021 and declining sharply through May 2021. Our results identify regions where targeted public health efforts could have been most effective and suggest that individuals' frequency of mask-wearing may be influenced by national guidance and disease prevalence. We validate our bias-correction approach by comparing debiased self-reported mask-wearing estimates with community-reported estimates, after addressing issues of small sample size and representation. Self-reported behavior estimates are especially prone to social desirability and non-response biases and our findings demonstrate that these biases can be reduced if individuals are asked to report on community rather than self behaviors.","1661":"Mosquitoes that carry Wolbachia endosymbionts may help control the spread of arboviral diseases, such as dengue, Zika and chikungunya. Wolbachia frequencies systematically increase only when the frequency-dependent advantage due to cytoplasmic incompatibility exceeds frequency-independent costs, which may be intrinsic to the Wolbachia and\/or can be associated with the genetic background into which Wolbachia are introduced. Costs depend on field conditions such as the environmental pesticide load. Introduced mosquitoes need adequate protection against insecticides to ensure survival after release. We model how insecticide resistance of transinfected mosquitoes determines the success of local Wolbachia introductions and link our theoretical results to field data. Two Ae. aegypti laboratory strains carrying Wolbachia were released in an isolated district of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: wMelBr (susceptible to pyrethroids) and wMelRio (resistant to pyrethroids). Our models elucidate why releases of the susceptible strain failed to result in Wolbachia establishment, while releases of the resistant strain led to Wolbachia transforming the native Ae. aegypti population. The results highlight the importance of matching insecticide resistance levels in release stocks to those in the target natural populations during Wolbachia deployment.","1662":"Two years into the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, populations with less built-up immunity continued to devise ways to optimize social distancing measures (SDMs) relaxation levels for outbreaks triggered by SARS-CoV-2 and its variants to resume minimal economics activities while avoiding hospital system collapse.At VC of 65%, scenarios of full SDMs relaxation (mean daily social encounters prior to COVID-19 pandemic\u00a0=\u00a014.1 contacts) for outbreaks triggered by ancestral strain, Alpha and Beta were sustainable. Restricting levels of SDMs was required such that the optimal population mobility had to be reduced to 0.9, 0.65 and 0.37 for Gamma, Delta and Omicron associated outbreaks respectively. VC improvement from 65% to 75% and 95% allowed complete SDMs relaxation in Gamma-, and Delta-driven epidemic respectively. However, this was not supported for Omicron-triggered epidemic.An age-stratified compartmental model featuring social mixing patterns was first fitted the incidence data in second wave in Hong Kong. Hypothetical scenario analysis was conducted by varying population mobility and vaccination coverages (VCs) to predict the number of hospital and intensive-care unit admissions in outbreaks initiated by ancestral strain and its variants (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron). Scenarios were \"unsustainable\" if either of admissions was larger than the maximum of its occupancy.To seek a path to normality, speedy vaccine and booster distribution to the majority across all age groups is the first step. Gradual or complete SDMs lift could be considered if the hybrid immunity could be achieved due to high vaccination coverage and natural infection rate among vaccinated or the COVID-19 case fatality rate could be reduced similar to that for seasonal influenza to secure hospital system sustainability.","1663":"If enough individuals in a population are immune to a pathogen, it cannot cause an outbreak. Deliberately seeking such herd immunity through infection during a potentially lethal pandemic is contrary to all principles of public health, given the potential for uncontrolled outbreaks and risks to vulnerable populations.","1664":"Transportation-related risk factors are a major source of morbidity and mortality in China, where the expansion of road networks and surges in personal vehicle ownership are having profound effects on public health. Road traffic injuries and fatalities have increased alongside increased use of motorised transport in China, and accident injury risk is aggravated by inadequate emergency response systems and trauma care. National air quality standards and emission control technologies are having a positive effect on air quality, but persistent air pollution is increasingly attributable to a growing and outdated vehicle fleet and to famously congested roads. Urban design favours motorised transport, and physical activity and its associated health benefits are hindered by poor urban infrastructure. Transport emissions of greenhouse gases contribute substantially to regional and global climate change, which compound public health risks from multiple factors. Despite these complex challenges, technological advances and innovations in planning and policy stand to make China a leader in sustainable, healthy transportation.","1665":" ) remains a major knowledge gap. We conducted a literature review and identified 24 host-parasite systems that had information on the temperature dependence of parasitism at both individual host and host population levels: 13 vector-borne systems and 11 environmentally transmitted systems. We found a strong positive correlation between the thermal optima of individual- and population-level parasitism, though several of the environmentally transmitted systems exhibited thermal optima >5\u00b0C apart between individual and population levels. Parasitism thermal optima were close to vector performance thermal optima in vector-borne systems but not hosts in environmentally transmitted systems, suggesting these thermal mismatches may be more common in certain types of host-parasite systems. We also adapted and simulated simple models for both types of transmission modes and found the same pattern across the two modes: thermal optima were more strongly correlated across scales when there were more traits linking individual- to population-level processes. Generally, our results suggest that information on the temperature dependence, and specifically the thermal optimum, at either the individual- or population-level should provide a useful-though not quantitatively exact-baseline for predicting temperature dependence at the other level, especially in vector-borne parasite systems. Environmentally transmitted parasitism may operate by a different set of rules, in which temperature-dependence is decoupled in some systems, requiring the need for trait-based studies of temperature-dependence at individual and population levels.","1666":"In this study, 17.7% (95% CI: 14.7, 20.5) of the respondents apply the basic preventive measures towards the prevention of the pandemic COVID-19.

Systematic random sampling method was applied among the predetermined 634 samples. Variables which had p-value less than 0.25 in bivariate analysis were considered as candidate for multivariable logistic regression model. P-value <0.05 was used as a cutoff point to determine statistical significance in multiple logistic regressions for the final model.Internationally, countries have reacted to the COVID-19 outbreak by introducing key public health non-pharmaceutical interventions to protect vulnerable population groups. In response to COVID-19, the Government of Ethiopia has been taking a series of policy actions beyond public health initiatives alone. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the applicability of basic preventive measures of the pandemic COVID-19 and associated factors among the residents of Guraghe Zone from 18th to 29th September, 2020.Despite the application of preventive measures and vaccine delivery, the applicability of the pandemic COVID-19 preventive measures was too low, which indicate that the Zone is at risk for the infection. Rural residents, those who have lower educational level, farmers, non-marrieds, those who have lower family size, those who have diagnosed medical illnesses and those who have poor knowledge were prone to the infection with the pandemic COVID-19 due to the lower practice of applying the basic preventive measures. In addition, awareness creation should be in practice at all levels of the community especially lower educational classes and rural residents.","1667":"Clostridioides difficile is the leading cause of infectious diarrhea and one of the most common healthcare-acquired infections worldwide. We performed a systematic search and a bibliometric analysis of mathematical and computational models for Clostridioides difficile transmission. We identified 33 publications from 2009 to 2021. Models have underscored the importance of asymptomatic colonized patients in maintaining transmission in health-care settings. Infection control, antimicrobial stewardship, active testing, and vaccination have often been evaluated in models. Despite active testing and vaccination being not currently implemented, they are the most commonly evaluated interventions. Some aspects of C.\u00a0difficile transmission, such community transmission and interventions in health-care settings other than in acute-care hospitals, remained less evaluated through modeling.","1668":"Predicting how pathogen populations will change over time is challenging. Such has been the case with Streptococcus pneumoniae, an important human pathogen, and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs), which target only a fraction of the strains in the population. Here, we use the frequencies of accessory genes to predict changes in the pneumococcal population after vaccination, hypothesizing that these frequencies reflect negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS) on the gene products. We find that the standardized predicted fitness of a strain, estimated by an NFDS-based model at the time the vaccine is introduced, enables us to predict whether the strain increases or decreases in prevalence following vaccination. Further, we are able to forecast the equilibrium post-vaccine population composition and assess the invasion capacity of emerging lineages. Overall, we provide a method for predicting the impact of an intervention on pneumococcal populations with potential application to other bacterial pathogens in which NFDS is a driving force.","1669":" = 0.12), although a modest effect is consistent with our findings.

The COVID-19 pandemic provided a singular opportunity to evaluate how influenza circulation worldwide was perturbed by human behavioral changes. We combine molecular, epidemiological, and international travel data and find that the pandemic's onset led to a shift in the intensity and structure of international influenza lineage movement. During the pandemic, South Asia played an important role as a phylogenetic trunk location of influenza A viruses, whereas West Asia maintained the circulation of influenza B\/Victoria. We explore drivers of influenza lineage dynamics across the pandemic period and reasons for the possible extinction of the B\/Yamagata lineage. After a period of 3 years, the intensity of among-region influenza lineage movements returned to pre-pandemic levels, with the exception of B\/Yamagata, after the recovery of global air traffic, highlighting the robustness of global lineage dispersal patterns to substantial perturbation.","1672":"Alternative states maintained by feedbacks are notoriously difficult, if not impossible, to reverse. Although positive interactions that modify soil conditions may have the greatest potential to alter self-reinforcing feedbacks, the conditions leading to these state change reversals have not been resolved. In a 9-yr study, we modified horizontal connectivity of resources by wind or water on different geomorphic surfaces in an attempt to alter plant-soil feedbacks and shift woody-plant-dominated states back toward perennial grass dominance. Modifying connectivity resulted in an increase in litter cover regardless of the vector of transport (wind, water) followed by an increase in perennial grass cover 2 yr later. Modifying connectivity was most effective on sandy soils where wind is the dominant vector, and least effective on gravelly soils on stable surfaces with low sediment movement by water. We found that grass cover was related to precipitation in the first 5\u00a0yr of our study, and plant-soil feedbacks developed following 6\u00a0yr of modified connectivity to overwhelm effects of precipitation on sandy, wind-blown soils. These feedbacks persisted through time under variable annual rainfall. On alluvial soils, either plant-soil feedbacks developed after 7\u00a0yr that were not persistent (active soils) or did not develop (stable soils). This novel approach has application to drylands globally where desertified lands have suffered losses in ecosystem services, and to other ecosystems where connectivity-mediated feedbacks modified at fine scales can be expected to impact plant recovery and state change reversals at larger scales, in particular for wind-impacted sites.","1673":" intrapulmonary basal-like progenitor cells.

Our foundational dataset elucidates the biological impact of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection across the body, a key step towards new treatments.","1674":"A one-year-follow-up retrospective cohort study has been conducted among NHS employees working at 123 facilities in Lincolnshire, UK.The reason why Black and South Asian healthcare workers are at a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection remain unclear. We aim to quantify risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among ethnic minority healthcare staff and elucidate pathways of infection.Overall, 13,366 professionals were included. SARS-CoV-2 incidence per person-year was 5.2% [95%CI: 3.6%-7.6%] during the first COVID-19 wave (Jan-Aug 2020) and 17.2% [13.5%-22.0%] during the second wave (Sep 2020-Feb 2021). Compared to White staff, Black and South Asian employees were at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection during both the first wave (HR, 1.58 [0.91-2.75] and 1.69 [1.07-2.66] respectively) and the second wave (HR 2.09 [1.57-2.76] and 1.46 [1.24-1.71]). Higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection persisted even after controlling for age, gender, pay grade, residence environment, type of work and time exposure at work. Higher adjusted risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection were also found among lower-paid health professionals.Black and South Asian health workers continue to be more at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to their White counterparts. Urgent interventions are required to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection in these ethnic groups.","1675":"Numerous social and behavioral factors have been implicated in vaccination coverage. There is no single measure that describes a country's ability to improve or maintain its immunization coverage.Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.In 1990, the mean VIP score was 0.49 (range\u00a0=\u00a00.13 to 0.86). In 2019, the mean score was 0.59 (range\u00a0=\u00a00.25 to 0.84). Consistent high performers included countries in Western Europe and high-income North America and East Asia. Important differences in subcomponents of the index drove major trends including vaccine hesitancy in Western Europe and Asia as well as lower levels of per capita health spending and development assistance in sub-Saharan Africa.The VIP Index is a first-of-its-kind tool for understanding the capacity that exists in a country to realize improved immunization rates. It is a new resource that can guide researchers, policymakers, and health officials to more effectively deploy resources to realize improvements in vaccination coverage, assess the impact of those improvements, and identify countries that might require additional support to improve vaccine coverage.We estimated the \"Vaccination Improvement Potential\" (VIP) by taking the geometric mean of 13 different indicators on health financing, vaccine confidence, and socio-demographics for more than 200 countries across 30 years. Potential VIP Index values range from 0 to 1, with a higher score indicating greater potential to improve or maintain high vaccination rates.","1676":" < 0.05). On multivariate analysis, only age remained significantly associated with increased odds of seropositivity. Despite high seroprevalence among camels, there was no serological confirmation of MERS-CoV infection among camel pastoralists in Marsabit County. The high seropositivity suggests that MERS-CoV or other closely related virus continues to circulate in camels and highlights ongoing potential for animal-to-human transmission.","1677":"Prediction and control of emerging pathogens is a fundamental challenge for public health. To meet this challenge, new analytic tools are needed to characterize the underlying dynamics of the geographical spread of pathogens, identify predictable changes in their dynamics, and support strategic planning for disease elimination and control. Nonparametric and model-independent tools are particularly needed. Here, we propose a multivariate method that uses similarity in cross-spectral density between measured spatial time series of disease prevalence as a feature measuring the proximity of a tipping point, i.e., emergence or elimination. In particular, we show that the increase in the average value of spectral similarity in measured epidemiological time series contains crucial information about the underlying dynamics and proximity to critical points in infectious disease systems. Theoretical analysis of a standard metapopulation SIR model and empirical analysis of case reports of pertussis in the continental USA demonstrate that this increase is observed when the disease approaches elimination. Therefore, this nonparametric indicator provides insight into the fundamental underlying state of the epidemiological system, which is key in developing appropriate strategies to more quickly achieve elimination goals.","1678":"The presence of influenza viral shedding in patients with influenza who have very few or no symptoms reflects their potential for transmitting the virus to close contacts. These findings suggest that further research is needed to investigate the contribution of persons with asymptomatic or clinically mild influenza virus infections to influenza virus transmission in household, institutional, and community settings.Influenza virus infections are associated with a wide spectrum of disease. However, few studies have investigated in detail the epidemiological and virological characteristics of asymptomatic and mild illness with influenza virus infections.In a community-based study in Hong Kong from 2008 to 2014, we followed up initially healthy individuals who were household contacts of symptomatic persons with laboratory-confirmed influenza, to identify secondary infections. Information from daily symptom diaries was used to classify infections as symptomatic (\u22652 signs\/symptoms, including fever \u226537.8\u00b0C, headache, myalgia, cough, sore throat, runny nose and sputum), paucisymptomatic (1 symptom only), or asymptomatic (none of these symptoms). We compared the patterns of influenza viral shedding between these groups.We identified 235 virologically confirmed secondary cases of influenza virus infection in the household setting, including 31 (13%) paucisymptomatic and 25 (11%) asymptomatic cases. The duration of viral RNA shedding was shorter and declined more rapidly in paucisymptomatic and asymptomatic than in symptomatic cases. The mean levels of influenza viral RNA shedding in asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic cases were approximately 1-2 log10 copies lower than in symptomatic cases.","1679":"Over 850 resistance indices globally were identified and abstracted, totaling >5 million isolates, from 340 unique locations. Resistance index coverage spanned 41 countries, 6 continents, 43 of 50 US states, and 8 of 10 Canadian provinces. When compared to reported values, aggregated resistance values for the United States and Canada during 2013 and 2014 demonstrated agreements ranging from 94% to 97%. For the United States, state-specific resistance estimates demonstrated an agreement of 92%. Large differences in antimicrobial susceptibility were seen within countries.Our understanding of the global burden of antimicrobial resistance is limited. Complementary approaches to antimicrobial resistance surveillance are needed.Using existing nontraditional data sources, we have developed a Web-based platform for aggregating antimicrobial resistance indices to support monitoring of regional antimicrobial resistance patterns.We developed a Web-based\/mobile platform for aggregating, analyzing, and disseminating regional antimicrobial resistance information. Antimicrobial resistance indices from existing but disparate online sources were identified and abstracted. To validate antimicrobial resistance data, in the absence of regional comparators, US and Canadian indices were aggregated and compared to existing national and state estimates. Measures of variability of antimicrobial susceptibility were determined for the United States and Canada to evaluate magnitudes of differences within countries.","1680":"We examine similar and differential effects of two senolytic treatments, ABT-263 and dasatinib + quercetin (D\u2009+\u2009Q), in preserving cognition, markers of peripheral senescence, and markers of brain aging thought to underlie cognitive decline. Male F344 rats were treated from 12 to 18\u2009months of age with D\u2009+\u2009Q, ABT-263, or vehicle, and were compared to young (6\u00a0months). Both senolytic treatments rescued memory, preserved the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and prevented the age-related decline in hippocampal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) function associated with impaired cognition. Senolytic treatments decreased senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and inflammatory cytokines\/chemokines in the plasma (IL-1\u03b2, IP-10, and RANTES), with some markers more responsive to D\u2009+\u2009Q (TNF\u03b1) or ABT-263 (IFN\u03b3, leptin, EGF). ABT-263 was more effective in decreasing senescence genes in the spleen. Both senolytic treatments decreased the expression of immune response and oxidative stress genes and increased the expression of synaptic genes in the dentate gyrus (DG). However, D\u2009+\u2009Q influenced twice as many genes as ABT-263. Relative to D\u2009+\u2009Q, the ABT-263 group exhibited increased expression of DG genes linked to cell death and negative regulation of apoptosis and microglial cell activation. Furthermore, D\u2009+\u2009Q was more effective at decreasing morphological markers of microglial activation. The results indicate that preserved cognition was associated with the removal of peripheral senescent cells, decreasing systemic inflammation that normally drives neuroinflammation, BBB breakdown, and impaired synaptic function. Dissimilarities associated with brain transcription indicate divergence in central mechanisms, possibly due to differential access.","1681":"In March 2021, following the annual International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) ratification vote on newly proposed taxa, the phylum Negarnaviricota was amended and emended. The phylum was expanded by four families (Aliusviridae, Crepuscuviridae, Myriaviridae, and Natareviridae), three subfamilies (Alpharhabdovirinae, Betarhabdovirinae, and Gammarhabdovirinae), 42 genera, and 200 species. Thirty-nine species were renamed and\/or moved and seven species were abolished.

The study was conducted at Aga Khan University, Hospital. Parents visiting the Community Health Center for 6-week vaccination of their children were recruited. The study was conducted in two stages. Stage 1 consisted of qualitative interviews that grasped the parent's attitudes and challenges to immunization, as well as their acceptability and accessibility of the smartphone-based behavior-change application to increase vaccine uptake. Stage 1 was followed by stage 2, in which data were collected through a questionnaire designed by using data from qualitative interviews.The majority of participants agreed that immunization serves an important role in protecting their child from illnesses that cause morbidity and mortality. Almost all of them emphasized the importance of using a pre-appointment method at vaccination center in order to reduce the waiting time. Furthermore, participants were also interested in AI-based behavior modification applications related to immunization. They also wanted to have applications in their native language for better understanding and communication of related information. In our study, approximately 95.2 percent of participants agreed to accept SMS immunization updates, which was also reasonably high. Lastly, the majority of them identified forgetfulness as a significant contributor to regular immunization.To enhance the uptake of childhood vaccines, overall vaccination rates, and overcome barriers related to vaccination coverage, cost-effective and user-friendly mHealth AI-based smart phone applications are required to raise awareness regarding the continuation of vaccination service and the importance of timely vaccination. Parents' experiences and attitudes must be considered while designing and evaluating the efficacy of mHealth-based interventions.Pakistan's immunization uptake rates are still significantly lower than anticipated despite several initiatives. Lack of awareness, forgetting about vaccination schedule, and vaccine misconception\/misinformation are a few of the major drivers that mitigate the rates of immunization. The current COVID-19 pandemic emphasizes the importance of immunization. The significant reductions in regular childhood vaccination during pandemic have increased the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Concerns among parents over possibly exposing their children to COVID-19 during child visits may have contributed to the reported declines. Innovative and cost-effective mHealth interventions must be implemented in order to address the problem of inadequate immunization rates. In addition, it is also critical to understand the end user needs in order to reflect on the highly relevant essence of the customized healthcare experience.The aim of this study was to learn about caregivers' attitudes toward the usability and acceptability of behavior-change smartphone applications (mobile phones) for improving immunization coverage in Pakistan.","1683":"SARS-CoV-2 infection causes diverse outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infection to respiratory distress and death. A major unresolved question is whether prior immunity to endemic, human common cold coronaviruses (hCCCoVs) impacts susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or immunity following infection and vaccination. Therefore, we analyzed samples from the same individuals before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We found hCCCoV antibody levels increase after SARS-CoV-2 exposure, demonstrating cross-reactivity. However, a case-control study indicates that baseline hCCCoV antibody levels are not associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Rather, higher magnitudes of pre-existing betacoronavirus antibodies correlate with more SARS-CoV-2 antibodies following infection, an indicator of greater disease severity. Additionally, immunization with hCCCoV spike proteins before SARS-CoV-2 immunization impedes the generation of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in mice. Together, these data suggest that pre-existing hCCCoV antibodies hinder SARS-CoV-2 antibody-based immunity following infection and provide insight on how pre-existing coronavirus immunity impacts SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is critical considering emerging variants.","1684":"Tuberculosis is a leading cause of global childhood mortality; however, interventions to detect undiagnosed tuberculosis in children are underused. Child contact tracing has been widely recommended but poorly implemented in resource-constrained settings. WHO has proposed a pragmatic screening approach for managing child contacts. We assessed the effectiveness of this screening approach and alternative symptom-based algorithms in identifying secondary tuberculosis in a prospectively followed cohort of Ugandan child contacts.Of 1718 household child contacts, 126 (7%) had coprevalent tuberculosis and 24 (1%) developed incident tuberculosis, diagnosed over the 2-year study period. Of these 150 cases of tuberculosis, 95 (63%) were microbiologically confirmed with a positive sputum culture. Using the WHO approach, 364 (21%) of 1718 child contacts had at least one tuberculosis-related symptom and 85 (23%) were identified as having coprevalent tuberculosis, 67% of all coprevalent cases detected (diagnostic odds ratio 9\u00b78, 95% CI 6\u00b78-14\u00b75; p<0\u00b70001). 1354 (79%) of 1718 child contacts had no symptoms, of whom 41 (3%) had coprevalent tuberculosis. The WHO approach was effective in contacts younger than 5 years: 70 (33%) of 211 symptomatic contacts had coprevalent disease compared with 23 (6%) of 367 asymptomatic contacts (p<0\u00b70001). This approach was also effective in contacts aged 5 years and older: 15 (10%) of 153 symptomatic contacts had coprevalent disease compared with 18 (2%) of 987 asymptomatic contacts (p<0\u00b70001). More coprevalent disease was detected in child contacts recommended for screening when the study population was restricted by HIV-serostatus (11 [48%] of 23 symptomatic HIV-seropositive child contacts vs two [7%] of 31 asymptomatic HIV-seropositive child contacts) or to only culture-confirmed cases (47 [13%] culture confirmed cases of 364 symptomatic child contacts vs 29 [2%] culture confirmed cases of 1354 asymptomatic child contacts). In the modified algorithm, high-risk asymptomatic child contacts were at increased risk for coprevalent disease versus low-risk asymptomatic contacts (14 [6%] of 224 vs 27 [2%] of 1130; p=0\u00b70021). The presence of tuberculosis infection did not predict incident disease in either symptomatic or asymptomatic child contacts: in symptomatic contacts, eight (5%) of 169 infected contacts and six (5%) of 111 uninfected contacts developed incident tuberculosis (p=0\u00b780). Among asymptomatic contacts, incident tuberculosis occurred in six (<1%) of 795 contacts infected at baseline versus four (<1%) of 518 contacts uninfected at baseline, respectively (p=1\u00b700).We identified index patients aged at least 18 years with microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis at Old Mulago Hospital (Kampala, Uganda) between Oct 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2008. Households of index patients were visited by fieldworkers within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Coprevalent and incident tuberculosis were assessed in household contacts through clinical, radiographical, and microbiological examinations for 2 years. Disease rates were compared among children younger than 16 years with and without symptoms included in the WHO pragmatic guideline (presence of haemoptysis, fever, chronic cough, weight loss, night sweats, and poor appetite). Symptoms could be of any duration, except cough (>21 days) and fever (>14 days). A modified WHO decision-tree designed to detect high-risk asymptomatic child contacts was also assessed, in which all asymptomatic contacts were classified as high risk (children younger than 3 years or immunocompromised [HIV-infected]) or low risk (aged 3 years or older and immunocompetent [HIV-negative]). We also assessed a more restrictive algorithm (ie, assessing only children with presence of chronic cough and one other tuberculosis-related symptom).WHO's pragmatic, symptom-based algorithm was an effective case-finding tool, especially in children younger than 5 years. A modified decision-tree identified 6% of asymptomatic child contacts at high risk for subclinical disease. Increasing the feasibility of child-contact tracing using these approaches should be encouraged to decrease tuberculosis-related paediatric mortality in high-burden settings, but this should be partnered with increasing access to microbiological point-of-care testing.National Institutes of Health, Tuberculosis Research Unit, AIDS International Training and Research Program of the Fogarty International Center, and the Center for AIDS Research.","1685":"A community mobilization protocol began with community discussion of baseline results. Each intervention cluster adapted the basic intervention-chemical-free prevention of mosquito reproduction-to its own circumstances. All clusters continued the government run dengue control program.Residents in a random sample of census enumeration areas across both countries: 75 intervention and 75 control clusters (about 140 households each) were randomized and analyzed (60 clusters in Nicaragua and 90 in Mexico), including 85,182 residents in 18,838 households.Pragmatic open label parallel group cluster randomized controlled trial. Those assessing the outcomes and analyzing the data were blinded to group assignment. Centralized computerized randomization after the baseline study allocated half the sites to intervention, stratified by country, evidence of recent dengue virus infection in children aged 3-9, and vector indices.ISRCTN27581154.Evidence based community mobilization can add effectiveness to dengue vector control. Each site implementing the intervention in its own way has the advantage of local customization and strong community engagement.To test whether community mobilization adds effectiveness to conventional dengue control.With cluster as the unit of analysis, serological evidence from intervention sites showed a lower risk of infection with dengue virus in children (relative risk reduction 29.5%, 95% confidence interval 3.8% to 55.3%), fewer reports of dengue illness (24.7%, 1.8% to 51.2%), fewer houses with larvae or pupae among houses visited (house index) (44.1%, 13.6% to 74.7%), fewer containers with larvae or pupae among containers examined (container index) (36.7%, 24.5% to 44.8%), fewer containers with larvae or pupae among houses visited (Breteau index) (35.1%, 16.7% to 55.5%), and fewer pupae per person (51.7%, 36.2% to 76.1%). The numbers needed to treat were 30 (95% confidence interval 20 to 59) for a lower risk of infection in children, 71 (48 to 143) for fewer reports of dengue illness, 17 (14 to 20) for the house index, 37 (35 to 67) for the container index, 10 (6 to 29) for the Breteau index, and 12 (7 to 31) for fewer pupae per person. Secondary per protocol analysis showed no serological evidence of a protective effect of temephos.Primary outcomes per protocol were self reported cases of dengue, serological evidence of recent dengue virus infection, and conventional entomological indices (house index: households with larvae or pupae\/households examined; container index: containers with larvae or pupae\/containers examined; Breteau index: containers with larvae or pupae\/households examined; and pupae per person: pupae found\/number of residents). Per protocol secondary analysis examined the effect of Camino Verde in the context of temephos use.Random sample of communities in Managua, capital of Nicaragua, and three coastal regions in Guerrero State in the south of Mexico.","1686":"We tested whether pregnant and non-pregnant women differ in COVID-19 symptom profile and severity, and we extended previous investigations on hospitalized pregnant women to those who did not require hospitalization. Two female community-based cohorts (18-44\u00a0years) provided longitudinal (smartphone application, N\u2009=\u20091,170,315, n\u2009=\u200979 pregnant tested positive) and cross-sectional (web-based survey, N\u2009=\u20091,344,966, n\u2009=\u2009134 pregnant tested positive) data, prospectively collected through self-participatory citizen surveillance in UK, Sweden and USA. Pregnant and non-pregnant were compared for frequencies of events, including SARS-CoV-2 testing, symptoms and hospitalization rates. Multivariable regression was used to investigate symptoms severity and comorbidity effects. Pregnant and non-pregnant women positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were not different in syndromic severity, except for gastrointestinal symptoms. Pregnant were more likely to have received testing, despite reporting fewer symptoms. Pre-existing lung disease was most closely associated with syndromic severity in pregnant hospitalized. Heart and kidney diseases and diabetes increased risk. The most frequent symptoms among non-hospitalized women were anosmia [63% pregnant, 92% non-pregnant] and headache [72%, 62%]. Cardiopulmonary symptoms, including persistent cough [80%] and chest pain [73%], were more frequent among pregnant who were hospitalized. Consistent with observations in non-pregnant populations, lung disease and diabetes were associated with increased risk of more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy.","1687":"Wildlife are important reservoirs for many pathogens, yet the role that different species play in pathogen maintenance frequently remains unknown. This is the case for rabies, a viral disease of mammals. While Carnivora (carnivores) and Chiroptera (bats) are the canonical mammalian orders known to be responsible for the maintenance and onward transmission of Rabies lyssavirus (RABV), the role of most species within these orders remains unknown and is continually changing as a result of contemporary host shifting. We combined a trait-based analytical approach with gradient boosting machine learning models (GBM models) to identify physiological and ecological host features associated with being a reservoir for RABV. We then used a cooperative game theory approach to determine species-specific traits associated with known RABV reservoirs. Being a carnivore reservoir for RABV was associated with phylogenetic similarity to known RABV reservoirs, along with other traits such as having larger litters and earlier sexual maturity. For bats, location in the Americas and geographic range were the most important predictors of RABV reservoir status, along with having a large litter. Our models identified 44 carnivore and 34 bat species that are currently not recognized as RABV reservoirs, but have trait profiles suggesting their capacity to be or become reservoirs. Further, our findings suggest that potential reservoir species among bats and carnivores occur both within and outside of areas with current rabies circulation. These results show the ability of a trait-based approach to detect potential reservoirs of infection and could inform rabies control programs and surveillance efforts by identifying the types of species and traits that facilitate RABV maintenance and transmission.","1688":"A qualitative exploratory study was conducted. A total of twenty one in-depth interviews were conducted with deceased infants' parents, elders of the family, religious leaders, community leaders, and funeral workers. Focus group discussions were conducted with health care providers (n\u2009=\u200914) in two peri-urban slum areas of Karachi, Pakistan. The duration of this study was from August to October 2020. Data was analyzed using thematic analysis and was coded and merged into categories forming eight major themes.This study is critical for understanding the challenges associated with implementation of community-based MITS sampling in Pakistan. Integrating the use of a mobile van for sample collection, grief counseling along with community engagement sessions and advocacy will help address community-based misinformation and develop community trust.Minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS) has increasingly been used to improve the diagnosis of disease and identification of the cause of death, particularly in underserved areas. However, there are multiple barriers to accessing those who die within the community, our study aimed to explore the perceptions and insights of community members and healthcare providers regarding the feasibility of implementing MITS in community settings.In general, participants viewed minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS) as beneficial for improving child health, though some had concerns about disrespecting the deceased during sample collection. Misinformation, fear of needles, and medical procedures were major barriers to MITS implementation. To enhance acceptance, community and religious leaders suggested using religious rulings, obtaining parental consent, ensuring confidentiality, and increasing efforts of community engagement. Community healthcare providers, along with funeral workers, recommended providing community members with grief counseling to increase study participation. Besides concerns about sampling interfering with respect for the decease, community members also raised concerns about misinformation. Further, participants provided feedback on the design and appearance of the mobile van used to collect MITS samples from children under the age of five.","1689":"Using a recent benchmark of 52.2% vaccination coverage among pregnant women, we studied a hypothetical cohort of 2,753,015 vaccinated pregnant women. With an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 73% among pregnant women and 63% among infants <6 months, QALY gains for each season were 305 (2010-2011), 123 (2011-2012), and 610 (2012-2013). Compared with no vaccination, seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy was cost-saving when using data from the 2010-2011 and 2012-2013 influenza seasons. The cost-effectiveness ratio was greater than $100,000\/QALY with the 2011-2012 influenza season data, when CDC reported a low attack rate compared to other recent seasons.Total costs (direct and indirect), effects (QALY gains, averted case numbers), and incremental cost-effectiveness of seasonal inactivated influenza vaccination among pregnant women (cost per QALY gained).We developed a decision-analytic model following a cohort of 5.2 million pregnant women and their infants aged <6 months to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating women against seasonal influenza during pregnancy from a societal perspective. The main outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained and cost-effectiveness ratios. Data sources included surveillance data, epidemiological studies, and published vaccine cost data. Sensitivity analyses were also performed. All costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% annually.Influenza vaccination for pregnant women can reduce morbidity from influenza in both pregnant women and their infants aged <6 months. Seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy is cost-saving during moderate to severe influenza seasons.To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of seasonal inactivated influenza vaccination among pregnant women using data from three recent influenza seasons in the United States.","1690":"Estimation of influenza-like illness (ILI) using search trends activity was intended to supplement traditional surveillance systems, and was a motivation behind the development of Google Flu Trends (GFT). However, several studies have previously reported large errors in GFT estimates of ILI in the US. Following recent release of time-stamped surveillance data, which better reflects real-time operational scenarios, we reanalyzed GFT errors. Using three data sources-GFT: an archive of weekly ILI estimates from Google Flu Trends; ILIf: fully-observed ILI rates from ILINet; and, ILIp: ILI rates available in real-time based on partial reporting-five influenza seasons were analyzed and mean square errors (MSE) of GFT and ILIp as estimates of ILIf were computed. To correct GFT errors, a random forest regression model was built with ILI and GFT rates from the previous three weeks as predictors. An overall reduction in error of 44% was observed and the errors of the corrected GFT are lower than those of ILIp. An 80% reduction in error during 2012\/13, when GFT had large errors, shows that extreme failures of GFT could have been avoided. Using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, one- to four-week ahead forecasts were generated with two separate data streams: ILIp alone, and with both ILIp and corrected GFT. At all forecast targets and seasons, and for all but two regions, inclusion of GFT lowered MSE. Results from two alternative error measures, mean absolute error and mean absolute proportional error, were largely consistent with results from MSE. Taken together these findings provide an error profile of GFT in the US, establish strong evidence for the adoption of search trends based 'nowcasts' in influenza forecast systems, and encourage reevaluation of the utility of this data source in diverse domains.","1691":"The evidence that dyadic adaptations of financial incentive treatments were feasible and tolerable, and the positive preliminary efficacy outcomes suggest that adequately powered RCTs formally evaluating the efficacy of dyadic adaptations of financial incentive treatments for dual-smoker couples are warranted.Dyadic implementations of financial incentive treatments are feasible to implement and tolerable to participants.Results suggest dyadic adaptations were feasible to implement (89% retention rate) and highly tolerable for participants (p's < .001). Neither feasibility nor tolerability varied across treatment arm. Preliminary efficacy outcomes indicated partner-involved financial incentive treatments have promise for increasing smoking cessation in dual-smoker couples (OR range: 2.36-13.06).Members of dual-smoker couples (in which both partners smoke) are unlikely to try to quit smoking and are likely to relapse if they do make an attempt. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility, tolerability, and preliminary outcomes of dyadic adaptations of financial incentive treatments to promote smoking cessation in dual-smoker couples.We enrolled 95 dual-smoker couples (N=190) in a three-arm feasibility RCT comparing two partner-involved financial incentive treatments (single vs. dual incentives) against a no-treatment control condition. Participants in all conditions were offered nicotine replacement and psychoeducation. A three-month follow-up provided information about retention, tolerability (i.e., self-reported benefits and costs of the study), and preliminary efficacy (i.e., program completion, quit attempts, point-prevalent abstinence, joint quitting).","1692":"In urban areas, Chinese caregivers' intent to delay vaccination in favour of 9vHPV vaccine over receiving the more accessible options was influenced by a mix of individual and contextual factors. Focussed health communication strategies are needed to accelerate HPV vaccination among adolescents.Adolescent girls in China have a low HPV vaccination rate. Although vaccination is recommended by the Chinese health authorities, the cost is not covered by the national immunisation programme. Vaccination delay, among other reasons such as supply shortage and poor affordability, may contribute to low uptake. This sequential mixed methods study aimed to identify potential factors of delayed HPV vaccination among Chinese adolescent girls.A total of 100 caregivers - 85 were mothers and 15 were fathers - participated in the survey; 21 caregivers joined focus group discussions. When asked about their intended course of action if the 9vHPV vaccine was out-of-stock, 74% chose to delay until the 9vHPV vaccine is available while 26% would consider 2vHPV or 4vHPV vaccines or seek alternative ways to procure the vaccine. Qualitative results confirmed that caregivers preferred delaying HPV vaccination for adolescent girls. The intent to delay was influenced by systemic barriers such as supply shortage and individual-level factors such as a preference for the 9vHPV vaccine, safety concerns, inadequate health communication, and the belief that adolescents were unlikely to be sexually active.Quantitative data about the attitudes and perceptions of HPV vaccination were collected from 100 caregivers of 14-18-year-old girls using an online survey in Chengdu, China. The survey data informed a subsequent qualitative study using four focus group discussions. We conducted a descriptive analysis of the survey data and a thematic analysis of the qualitative data. The findings were interpreted using a health behaviour model adapted from the Health Belief Model and the Andersen's Behavioural Model for Health Services Use.","1693":"BackgroundTo control epidemic waves, it is important to know the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and its evolution over time in relation to the control measures taken.AimTo assess the evolving SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and seroincidence related to the first national lockdown in Belgium, we performed a nationwide seroprevalence study, stratified by age, sex and region using 3,000-4,000 residual samples during seven periods between 30 March and 17 October 2020.MethodsWe analysed residual sera from ambulatory patients for IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein with a semiquantitative commercial ELISA. Weighted seroprevalence (overall and by age category and sex) and seroincidence during seven consecutive periods were estimated for the Belgian population while accommodating test-specific sensitivity and specificity.ResultsThe weighted overall seroprevalence initially increased from 1.8% (95% credible interval (CrI): 1.0-2.6) to 5.3% (95% CrI: 4.2-6.4), implying a seroincidence of 3.4% (95% CrI: 2.4-4.6) between the first and second collection period over a period of 3 weeks during lockdown (start lockdown mid-March 2020). Thereafter, seroprevalence stabilised, however, significant decreases were observed when comparing the third with the fifth, sixth and seventh period, resulting in negative seroincidence estimates after lockdown was lifted. We estimated for the last collection period mid-October 2020 a weighted overall seroprevalence of 4.2% (95% CrI: 3.1-5.2).ConclusionDuring lockdown, an initially small but increasing fraction of the Belgian population showed serologically detectable signs of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, which did not further increase when confinement measures eased and full lockdown was lifted.","1694":"When the body gets infected by a pathogen the immune system develops pathogen-specific immunity. Induced immunity decays in time and years after recovery the host might become susceptible again. Exposure to the pathogen in the environment boosts the immune system thus prolonging the time in which a recovered individual is immune. Such an interplay of within host processes and population dynamics poses significant challenges in rigorous mathematical modeling of immuno-epidemiology. We propose a framework to model SIRS dynamics, monitoring the immune status of individuals and including both waning immunity and immune system boosting. Our model is formulated as a system of two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) coupled with a PDE. After showing existence and uniqueness of a classical solution, we investigate the local and the global asymptotic stability of the unique disease-free stationary solution. Under particular assumptions on the general model, we can recover known examples such as large systems of ODEs for SIRWS dynamics, as well as SIRS with constant delay. ","1695":"The evolution of postzygotic reproductive isolation is an important component of speciation. But before isolation is complete there is sometimes a phase of heterosis in which hybrid fitness exceeds that of the two parental species. The genetics and evolution of heterosis and postzygotic isolation have typically been studied in isolation, precluding the development of a unified theory of speciation. Here, we develop a model that incorporates both positive and negative gene interactions, and accounts for the evolution of both heterosis and postzygotic isolation. We parameterize the model with recent data on the fitness effects of 10,000 mutations in yeast, singly and in pairwise epistatic combinations. The model makes novel predictions about the types of interactions that contribute to declining hybrid fitness. We reproduce patterns familiar from earlier models of speciation (e.g. Haldane's Rule and Darwin's Corollary) and identify new mechanisms that may underlie these patterns. Our approach provides a general framework for integrating experimental data from gene interaction networks into speciation theory and makes new predictions about the genetic mechanisms of speciation.","1696":"Conflict is significantly associated with increased CL\/ML cases. This is especially true at higher conflict levels, marking when conflict turns violent. The destruction of critical infrastructure (e.g., that related to healthcare, water, and sanitation) often seen during conflict could drive this association. Such environments can be hospitable to sandflies and can heighten individuals' vulnerability through increased malnutrition, poverty, and displacement. Understanding this relationship is crucial for public health preparedness and response, especially as conflicts become increasingly violent and protracted.Cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (CL\/ML) cause significant morbidity globally and are vulnerable to changes from environmental events and conflict. In this ecological study, we aim to measure the associations between annual CL\/ML cases, conflict intensity, and environmental factors between 2005 and 2022 globally.We pulled annual case data from the WHO for 52 nations that had conflict intensity scores (ranging from 1-10) from the Bertelsmann Transformation Index. Using Earth observation tools, we gathered temperature, precipitation, vegetation, and humidity data, in addition to data on annual estimates of population, internal displacement, and GDP. We fit a negative binomial generalized additive model with a random nation-level intercept.Conflict was positively associated with increased CL\/ML across the studied nations (IRR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.01-1.16, p = 0.02). Given this, intense conflict (a score of ten) was associated with over double the risk of CL\/ML compared to the lowest conflict levels (score of one). We also identified a curvilinear relationship between mean temperature and cases, as well as between vegetation level and cases. Each had small pockets of significant increased and decreased risk, respectively. Larger mean humidity ranges were negatively associated with cases. Importantly, the relationship between conflict intensity and cases was mediated by displacement.","1697":"Branching processes are a class of continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) with ubiquitous applications. A general difficulty in statistical inference under partially observed CTMC models arises in computing transition probabilities when the discrete state space is large or uncountable. Classical methods such as matrix exponentiation are infeasible for large or countably infinite state spaces, and sampling-based alternatives are computationally intensive, requiring integration over all possible hidden events. Recent work has successfully applied generating function techniques to computing transition probabilities for linear multi-type branching processes. While these techniques often require significantly fewer computations than matrix exponentiation, they also become prohibitive in applications with large populations. We propose a compressed sensing framework that significantly accelerates the generating function method, decreasing computational cost up to a logarithmic factor by only assuming the probability mass of transitions is sparse. We demonstrate accurate and efficient transition probability computations in branching process models for blood cell formation and evolution of self-replicating transposable elements in bacterial genomes.","1698":"Our findings indicate that sepsis was substantially associated with an increased risk of renal failure. The risk was highest during the first week following sepsis for both acute temporary and chronic dialysis cases.Patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) are at risk of kidney damage, potentially necessitating acute temporary or chronic dialysis. Our study aims to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of preceding sepsis among patients requiring their first dialysis.A nationwide population-based case-only study was conducted using claims records from the National Health insurance database of Taiwan. All patients over 20 years of age who underwent their first dialysis between 2004 and 2016 were included in the study. The six months prior to their first dialysis served as a self-control period.The study included 147,201 patients who required acute temporary and 75,031 patients who required chronic dialysis. The odds ratios for patients needing acute temporary dialysis after 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks of exposure periods were 15.8, 10.7, 9.2, and 8.4, respectively. The ORs for patients requiring chronic dialysis were 7.0, 4.1, 4.2, and 3.7, respectively.","1699":"The most important determinants of the decision to test onsite versus send-out were the clinical utility lost due to send-out testing delays and the accuracy decrement with onsite testing. When the sensitivity decrements of onsite testing were minimal, onsite testing tended to be preferred when send-out delays reduced clinical utility by >20%. By contrast, when onsite testing incurred large reductions in sensitivity, onsite testing tended to be preferred when utility lost due to delays was >50%. The relative cost of onsite versus send-out testing affected these thresholds, particularly when testing costs were >10% of treatment costs.We developed a decision model to compare the incremental utility of onsite versus send-out testing for clinical purposes. We then performed Monte Carlo simulations to identify the settings under which each strategy would be preferred. Tuberculosis was modeled as an exemplar.Laboratory networks provide services through onsite testing or through specimen transport to higher-tier laboratories. This decision is based on the interplay of testing characteristics, treatment characteristics, and epidemiological characteristics.The design of laboratory networks, including the decision to place diagnostic instruments at the point-of-care or at higher tiers as accessed through specimen transport, can be informed using the threshold approach to medical decision making.The most important determinants of the decision to test onsite versus send-out were the clinical utility lost due to send-out testing delays and the accuracy decrement with onsite testing.The threshold approach to medical decision making can be used to compare point-of-care testing accuracy decrements with the lost utility of treatment due to send-out testing delays.The relative cost of onsite versus send-out testing affected these thresholds, particularly when testing costs were >10% of treatment costs.Our objective was to develop a generalizable model using the threshold approach to medical decision making to inform test placement decisions.Decision makers can select onsite versus send-out testing in an evidence-based fashion using estimates of the percentage of clinical utility lost due to send-out delays and the relative accuracy of onsite versus send-out testing. This model is designed to be generalizable to a wide variety of use cases.","1700":"The COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for models that can project epidemic trends, explore intervention scenarios, and estimate resource needs. Here we describe the methodology of Covasim (COVID-19 Agent-based Simulator), an open-source model developed to help address these questions. Covasim includes country-specific demographic information on age structure and population size; realistic transmission networks in different social layers, including households, schools, workplaces, long-term care facilities, and communities; age-specific disease outcomes; and intrahost viral dynamics, including viral-load-based transmissibility. Covasim also supports an extensive set of interventions, including non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as physical distancing and protective equipment; pharmaceutical interventions, including vaccination; and testing interventions, such as symptomatic and asymptomatic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine. These interventions can incorporate the effects of delays, loss-to-follow-up, micro-targeting, and other factors. Implemented in pure Python, Covasim has been designed with equal emphasis on performance, ease of use, and flexibility: realistic and highly customized scenarios can be run on a standard laptop in under a minute. In collaboration with local health agencies and policymakers, Covasim has already been applied to examine epidemic dynamics and inform policy decisions in more than a dozen countries in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America.","1701":". Although marine stickleback and some susceptible lake fish permit fast-growing tapeworms, other lake populations are resistant and suppress tapeworm growth via a fibrosis response. We subjected lab-raised fish from three populations (susceptible marine \"ancestors,\" a susceptible lake population, and a resistant lake population) to a novel immune challenge using an injection of (1) a saline control, (2) alum, a generalized pro-inflammatory adjuvant that causes fibrosis, (3) a tapeworm protein extract, or (4) a combination of alum and tapeworm protein. With enough time, all three populations generated a robust fibrosis response to the alum treatments. Yet, only the resistant population exhibited a fibrosis response to the tapeworm protein alone. Thus, these populations differed in their ability to respond to the tapeworm protein but shared an intact fibrosis pathway. The resistant population also initiated fibrosis faster in response to alum, and was able to attenuate fibrosis, unlike the susceptible populations' slow but longer lasting response to alum. As fibrosis has pathological side effects that reduce fecundity, the faster recovery by the resistant population may reflect an adaptation to mitigate the costs of immunity. Broadly, our results confirm that parasite detection and immune initiation, activation speed, and immune attenuation simultaneously contribute to the evolution of parasite resistance and adaptations to infection in natural populations.","1702":"Since the initial description of the genomic patterns expected under models of positive selection acting on standing genetic variation and on multiple beneficial mutations-so-called soft selective sweeps-researchers have sought to identify these patterns in natural population data. Indeed, over the past two years, large-scale data analyses have argued that soft sweeps are pervasive across organisms of very different effective population size and mutation rate-humans, Drosophila, and HIV. Yet, others have evaluated the relevance of these models to natural populations, as well as the identifiability of the models relative to other known population-level processes, arguing that soft sweeps are likely to be rare. Here, we look to reconcile these opposing results by carefully evaluating three recent studies and their underlying methodologies. Using population genetic theory, as well as extensive simulation, we find that all three examples are prone to extremely high false-positive rates, incorrectly identifying soft sweeps under both hard sweep and neutral models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that well-fit demographic histories combined with rare hard sweeps serve as the more parsimonious explanation. These findings represent a necessary response to the growing tendency of invoking parameter-heavy, assumption-laden models of pervasive positive selection, and neglecting best practices regarding the construction of proper demographic null models.","1703":"This randomized controlled trial (NCT02408926) followed term infants born to mothers vaccinated with tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine during pregnancy in Thailand. Infants received either acellular pertussis (aP)- or wP-containing vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 18 months of age. A comparison group comprised wP-vaccinated children born to mothers not vaccinated during pregnancy. Antibodies against pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), and pertactin (PRN) were evaluated using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Functionality of antibodies against Bordetella pertussis was measured using Bordetella pertussis growth inhibition assay.Maternal Tdap vaccination inhibited more pertussis-specific responses in wP-vaccinated infants compared to aP-vaccinated infants, and the control group of unvaccinated women had highest PT-specific responses, persisting until after the booster dose. Antibody functionality was better in the wP groups.NCT02408926.Infant whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccine responses are blunted after maternal Tdap vaccination. Pertussis antibody titers are higher in acellular pertussis (aP)- than wP-vaccinated infants of immunized mothers, yet quality of antibodies, measured as serum-mediated bacterial growth inhibition, is better after wP than aP vaccination.The blunting effect of pertussis immunization during pregnancy on infant antibody responses induced by whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccination is not well-defined.After maternal Tdap vaccination, 158 infants vaccinated with aP-containing vaccines possessed higher antibody levels (P < .001) against all tested B. pertussis antigens postpriming compared to 157 infants receiving wP-containing vaccines. At 1 month postbooster, only anti-FHA and anti-PRN antibodies were still significantly higher (P < .001) in the aP group. Significantly higher anti-PT and anti-FHA (P < .001), but not anti-PRN immunoglobulin G, were observed among 69 wP-vaccinated infants born to control mothers compared with wP-vaccinated infants of Tdap-vaccinated mothers after primary and booster vaccination. The antibody functionality was higher in all wP-vaccinated infants at all times.","1704":"Hookworm infection (Necator americanus and Ancylostoma spp) causes significant morbidity in resource-limited countries. Dog and pig ownership is associated with human infection, although the mechanism through which animals increase risk remains unknown. We first confirmed this association in Kintampo North, Ghana, using a retrospective analysis and serology, followed by a prospective molecular study of animal faeces. As a proxy of exposure to dog faeces, we analysed immunoreactivity of human serum to the zoonotic nematode Toxocara canis. Anti-Toxocara antibodies were present in 62% of samples (n\u00a0=\u00a089), and reactivity was associated with dog ownership. A subsequent prospective study revealed that 43% of dog and 56% of pig faecal samples contained hookworm eggs by microscopy. PCR analysis confirmed the presence of N.\u00a0americanus DNA in 47% of samples from dogs and 56% pig samples. Nematode larvae were successfully cultured from samples collected from 36 dogs and seven pigs. These results demonstrate that dogs and pigs have a likely role in the transmission of N.\u00a0americanus in endemic communities.","1705":"An edge switch is an operation on a graph (or network) where two edges are selected randomly and one of their end vertices are swapped with each other. Edge switch operations have important applications in graph theory and network analysis, such as in generating random networks with a given degree sequence, modeling and analyzing dynamic networks, and in studying various dynamic phenomena over a network. The recent growth of real-world networks motivates the need for efficient parallel algorithms. The dependencies among successive edge switch operations and the requirement to keep the graph simple (i.e., no self-loops or parallel edges) as the edges are switched lead to significant challenges in designing a parallel algorithm. Addressing these challenges requires complex synchronization and communication among the processors leading to difficulties in achieving a good speedup by parallelization. In this paper, we present distributed memory parallel algorithms for switching edges in massive networks. These algorithms provide good speedup and scale well to a large number of processors. A harmonic mean speedup of 73.25 is achieved on eight different networks with 1024 processors. One of the steps in our edge switch algorithms requires the computation of multinomial random variables in parallel. This paper presents the first non-trivial parallel algorithm for the problem, achieving a speedup of 925 using 1024 processors.","1706":"The development of antiviral treatments for SARS-CoV-2 was an important turning point for the pandemic. Availability of safe and effective antivirals has allowed people to return back to normal life. While SARS-CoV-2 antivirals are highly effective at preventing severe disease, there have been concerning reports of viral rebound in some patients after cessation of antiviral treatment. In this study, we use a mathematical model of viral infection to study the potential of different antivirals to prevent viral rebound. We find that antivirals that block production are most likely to result in viral rebound if the treatment time course is not sufficiently long. Since these antivirals do not prevent infection of cells, cells continue to be infected during treatment. When treatment is stopped, the infected cells will begin producing virus at the usual rate. Antivirals that prevent infection of cells are less likely to result in viral rebound since cells are not being infected during treatment. This study highlights the role of antiviral mechanism of action in increasing or reducing the probability of viral rebound.","1707":"This study relied upon data sourced from the first Integrated Biological and Behavioural Survey among Mozambican miners earning their living in South African mines. It employs quantitative techniques using standard statistical tools to substantiate the laid-down objectives. The primary technique applied in this paper is the multivariable statistical method used in the formulation and application of a proximate determinants framework.The odds of reporting one sexual partner were roughly three times higher for miners working as perforators as opposed to other types of occupation. As well, the odds of condom use - always or sometimes - for miners in the 31-40 age group were three times higher than the odds of condom use in the 51+ age group. Miners with lower education levels were less likely to use condoms. The odds of being HIV positive when the miner reports use of alcohol or drugs (sometimes\/always) is 0.32 times lower than the odds for those reporting never use of alcohol or drugs. And finally, the odds of HIV positive status for those using condoms were 2.16 times that of miners who never used condoms, controlling for biological and other proximate determinants.In Mozambique, behavioural theory emphasising personal behavioural changes is the main strategy to combat HIV among miners. Our findings suggest there is a need to change thinking processes about how to influence safer sexual behaviour. This is viewed to be the result of a person's individual decision, due to of the complexity of social and contextual factors that may also influence sexual behaviours. This only stresses the need for HIV prevention strategies to exclusively transcend individual factors while considering the broader social and contextual phenomena influencing HIV risk among Mozambican miners.Information dealing with social and behavioural risk factors as well as their mechanisms among Mozambican migrants working in South African mines remains undocumented. This study aims to understand the various factors influencing HIV-related risk behaviours and the resulting HIV positive status of Mozambican miners employed by South African mines. This analysis was undertaken in order to inform a broader and more effective HIV preventive framework in Mozambique.","1708":"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed weaknesses in healthcare systems in the emerging economies of Turkey, Egypt, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Poland, and highlighted the intricate link between health and economy. Individual-level testing, isolation, and contact tracing are effective public health interventions in mitigating the health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison to population-level measures of lockdowns. Smart investments in public health, including digital health and linking health security with sustainable development, are key for economic gain, social stability, and more equitable and sustainable development.The COVID-19 pandemic had a colossal impact on human society globally. There were similarities and differences in the public health and social measures taken by countries, and comparative analysis facilitates cross-country learning of contextual practices and sharing lessons to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic impact. Our aim is to conduct a situational analysis of the public health and social measures to mitigate the health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey, Egypt, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Poland during 2020-2021.We conducted a situational analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic response in Turkey, Egypt, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Poland from the perspectives of the health system and health finance, national coordination, surveillance, testing capacity, health infrastructure, healthcare workforce, medical supply, physical distancing and non-pharmaceutical interventions, health communication, impact on non-COVID-19 health services, impact on the economy, education, gender and civil liberties, and COVID-19 vaccination.Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Turkey, Egypt, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Poland have expanded COVID-19 testing and treatment capacity over time. However, they faced a shortage of healthcare workforce and medical supplies. They took population-based quarantine measures rather than individual-based isolation measures, which significantly burdened their economies and disrupted education. The unemployment rate increased, and economic growth stagnated. Economic stimulus policy was accompanied by high inflation. Despite the effort to sustain essential health services, healthcare access declined. Schools were closed for 5-11\u00a0months. Gender inequality was aggravated in Turkey and Ukraine, and an issue was raised for balancing public health measures and civil liberties in Egypt and Poland. Digital technologies played an important role in maintaining routine healthcare, education, and public health communication.","1709":"Adults with HM in general and patients with lymphoid malignancies in particular have an increased risk for IPD, compared with patients with other types of cancer and with individuals free of cancer. The pneumococcal vaccination uptake is extremely low in this at risk-population. Efforts to prevent IPD in HM patients are continuously warranted.Patients with hematological malignancies (HM) are known to carry an increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). However, temporal variations in IPD risks following a cancer diagnosis remain poorly characterized. To inform vaccine guidelines and patient management, we assessed the IPD incidence among patients with HM and other malignancies.During 85\u2005002 224 person-years of observation, 13\u2005332 episodes of a first IPD were observed, of which 765 (5.7%) occurred among individuals with HM. Among HM patients, the IPD incidence rate decreased continuously during the study period (rate ratio per year,\u20050.91; 95% confidence interval, .90-.92). The risk of IPD in patients with HM was up to 39 times higher when compared to the background population and was highest for multiple myeloma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Unlike other malignancies, the increased IPD risk did not wane with the time since HM diagnosis. We found a vaccination uptake of only \u22642% in patients with HM and \u22641% for those with other types of malignancies.The study population included all individuals aged\u2005\u226515 years during 2000-2016 in Denmark. Variations in incidences of IPD over time and between different types of hematological malignancies and diagnoses were assessed by Poisson regression.","1710":"When estimating important measures such as the herd immunity threshold, and the corresponding efforts required to eliminate measles, it is often assumed that susceptible individuals are uniformly distributed throughout populations. However, unvaccinated individuals may be clustered in a variety of ways, including by geographic location, by age, in schools, or in households. Here, we investigate to which extent different levels of within-household clustering of susceptible individuals may impact the risk and persistence of measles outbreaks. To this end, we apply an individual-based model, Stride, to a population of 600,000 individuals, using data from Flanders, Belgium. We construct a metric to estimate the level of within-household susceptibility clustering in the population. Furthermore, we compare realistic scenarios regarding the distribution of susceptible individuals within households in terms of their impact on epidemiological measures for outbreak risk and persistence. We find that higher levels of within-household clustering of susceptible individuals increase the risk, size and persistence of measles outbreaks. Ignoring within-household clustering thus leads to underestimations of required\u00a0measles elimination and outbreak mitigation efforts.","1711":"In this study, we develop a fractional tumor-immune interaction model specifically for lung cancer (FTIIM-LC). We present some definitions and significant results related to the Caputo operator. We employ the generalized Laguerre polynomials (GLPs) method to find the optimal solution for the FTIIM-LC model. We then conduct a numerical simulation and compare the results of our method with other techniques and real-world data.Cancer, a complex and deadly health concern today, is characterized by forming potentially malignant tumors or cancer cells. The dynamic interaction between these cells and their environment is crucial to the disease. Mathematical models can enhance our understanding of these interactions, helping us predict disease progression and treatment strategies.We propose a FTIIM-LC model in this paper. The approximate solution for the proposed model is derived using a series of expansions in a new set of polynomials, the GLPs. To streamline the process, we integrate Lagrange multipliers, GLPs, and operational matrices of fractional and ordinary derivatives. We conduct a numerical simulation to study the effects of varying fractional orders and achieve the expected theoretical results.The findings of this study demonstrate that the optimization methods used can effectively predict and analyze complex phenomena. This innovative approach can also be applied to other nonlinear differential equations, such as the fractional Klein-Gordon equation, fractional diffusion-wave equation, breast cancer model, and fractional optimal control problems.","1712":"A key unknown for SARS-CoV-2 is how asymptomatic infections contribute to transmission. We used a transmission model with asymptomatic and presymptomatic states, calibrated to data on disease onset and test frequency from the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak, to quantify the contribution of asymptomatic infections to transmission. The model estimated that 74% (70-78%, 95% posterior interval) of infections proceeded asymptomatically. Despite intense testing, 53% (51-56%) of infections remained undetected, most of them asymptomatic. Asymptomatic individuals were the source for 69% (20-85%) of all infections. The data did not allow identification of the infectiousness of asymptomatic infections, however low ranges (0-25%) required a net reproduction number for individuals progressing through presymptomatic and symptomatic stages of at least 15. Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections may contribute substantially to transmission. Control measures, and models projecting their potential impact, need to look beyond the symptomatic cases if they are to understand and address ongoing transmission.","1713":"Death or discharge to hospice.A retrospective cohort study using discrete-time survival models, fit with generalised estimating equations.To assess whether increasing levels of hospital stress-measured by intensive care unit (ICU) bed occupancy (primary), ventilators in use and emergency department (ED) overflow-were associated with decreasing COVID-19 ICU patient survival in Colorado ICUs during the pre-Delta, Delta and Omicron variant eras.Overall, and especially during the Delta era (when most Colorado facilities were at their fullest), increasing exposure to a fuller hospital was associated with an increasing mortality hazard for COVID-19 ICU patients.For Delta-era COVID-19 ICU patients in Colorado, the odds of death were estimated to be 26% greater for patients exposed every day of their ICU admission to a facility experiencing its all-era 75th percentile ICU fullness or above, versus patients exposed for none of their days (OR: 1.26; 95%\u2009CI: 1.04 to 1.54; p=0.0102), adjusting for age, sex, length of ICU stay, vaccination status and hospital quality rating. For both Delta-era and Omicron-era patients, we also detected significantly increased mortality hazard associated with high ventilator utilisation rates and (in a subset of facilities) states of ED overflow. For pre-Delta-era patients, we estimated relatively null or even protective effects for the same fullness exposures, something which provides a meaningful contrast to previous studies that found increased hazards but were limited to pre-Delta study windows.34 hospital systems in Colorado, USA, with the highest patient volume ICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic.9196 non-paediatric SARS-CoV-2 patients in Colorado hospitals admitted once to an ICU between 1 August 2020 and 1 March 2022 and followed for 28 days.","1714":" CovMulNet19 can be suitably used for network medicine analysis, as a valuable tool for exploring drug repurposing while accounting for the intervening multidimensional factors, from molecular interactions to symptoms.","1715":"National Institute on Drug Abuse and National Institute of Mental Health.Long-acting injectable PrEP has the potential to produce larger reductions in HIV transmission in MSM than oral PrEP. However, the real-world, population-level impact of this approach will depend on uptake of this prevention method and its effectiveness, as well as retention of patients in clinical care.In the absence of PrEP, the model predicted 2374 new HIV infections (95% simulation interval [SI] 2345-2412) between 2015 and 2024. The cumulative number of new HIV infections was reduced in all scenarios in which MSM received long-acting injectable PrEP compared with oral PrEP. At a coverage level of 35%, compared with no PrEP, long-acting injectable PrEP led to a 44% reduction in new HIV infections (1044 new infections averted [95% SI 1018-1077]) versus 33% (792 infections averted [763-821]) for oral PrEP. The relative benefit of long-acting injectable PrEP was sensitive to the assumed efficacy of injections received every 8 weeks, discontinuation rates, and terminal drug half-life.Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) prevents HIV infection in men who have sex with men (MSM); however, adherence is an ongoing concern. Long-acting injectable PrEP is being tested in phase 3 trials and could address challenges associated with adherence. We examined the potential effectiveness of long-acting injectable PrEP compared with oral PrEP in MSM.We used an agent-based model to simulate HIV transmission in a dynamic network of 11\u2008245 MSM in Atlanta, GA, USA. We used raw data from studies in macaque models and pharmacokinetic data from safety trials to estimate the time-varying efficacy of long-acting injectable PrEP. The effect of long-acting injectable PrEP on the cumulative number of new HIV infections over 10 years (2015-24) was compared with no PrEP and daily oral PrEP across a range of coverage levels. Sensitivity analyses were done with varying maximum efficacy and drug half-life values.","1716":"Livestock can provide benefits to low-income households, yet may expose children to zoonotic enteropathogens that cause illness and negative long-term health outcomes. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether livestock-related risk factors, including animal ownership, exposure to animal feces, and consumption of animal-source foods, were associated with bacterial zoonotic enteropathogen infections in children 6-59 months old in Greater Accra, Ghana. Stool samples from 259 children and 156 household chickens were analyzed for atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (aEPEC), Campylobacter jejuni\/coli (C. jejuni\/coli), Salmonella, and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). aEPEC, C. jejuni\/coli, STEC, and Salmonella were detected in 45.6%, 11.6%, 4.3%, and 0.8% of children's stool samples, respectively. In adjusted logistic regression models, household ownership of goats or sheep was associated with STEC detection in children (odds ratio [95% confidence interval {CI}]: 4.30 [1.32, 14.08]), as were positive detection of STEC in chicken feces (7.85 [2.54, 24.30]) and frequent consumption of fresh cow's milk (3.03 [1.75, 5.24]). No livestock-related risk factors were associated with aEPEC or C. jejuni\/coli infection in children. Our findings suggest that ruminant ownership in southern Ghana may expose children to STEC through household fecal contamination and foodborne routes. The lack of association between livestock risk factors and the more commonly detected pathogens, aEPEC and C. jejuni\/coli, warrants further research, particularly to help explain how animal-keeping and sanitation practices affect transmission of fecal pathogens that were highly prevalent in chicken feces.","1717":"The extent to which vector-borne diseases (VBDs) have shaped human history remains under-recognized, even in the disease ecology community, despite several well-known examples. Although they represent a significant threat to global human health, accounting for more than one billion cases and one million deaths annually, VBDs have coexisted with humans since the advent of civilization and have migrated with humans around the world. Here, we synthesize historical, anthropological, and archaeological evidence and examine it through an ecological lens to illustrate how four major VBDs\u0097plague, malaria, yellow fever, and trypanosomiasis\u0097have shaped the course of human history through three main pathways: (1) outcomes of colonialism, imperialism, war, and conflict; (2) human interactions with the environment; and (3) intrasocietal human interactions. For example, malaria tipped the American Revolution toward the Continental Army; plague promoted reforestation in Europe; yellow fever entrenched African slavery in colonies in the Americas; trypanosomiasis impeded large settlements and central governments in pre-colonial sub-Saharan Africa. By drawing comparisons across diseases, time periods, and geographic locations, we show how VBDs have historically affected human populations, from the age of early Homo sapiens to the modern context, and how they continue to impact the world.","1718":"We study the feedback processes between individual behavior, disease prevalence, interventions and social networks during an influenza pandemic when a limited stockpile of antivirals is shared between the private and the public sectors. An economic model that uses prevalence-elastic demand for interventions is combined with a detailed social network and a disease propagation model to understand the feedback mechanism between epidemic dynamics, market behavior, individual perceptions, and the social network. An urban and a rural region are simulated to assess the robustness of results. Results show that an optimal split between the private and public sectors can be reached to contain the disease but the accessibility of antivirals from the private sector is skewed towards the richest income quartile. Also, larger allocations to the private sector result in wastage where individuals who do not need it are able to purchase it but who need it cannot afford it. Disease prevalence increases with household size and total contact time but not by degree in the social network, whereas wastage of antivirals decreases with degree and contact time. The best utilization of drugs is achieved when individuals with high contact time use them, who tend to be the school-aged children of large families.","1719":"Behaviour underpins interactions among conspecifics and between species, with consequences for the transmission of disease-causing parasites. Because many parasites lead to declines in population size and increased risk of extinction for threatened species, understanding the link between host behaviour and disease transmission is particularly important for conservation management. Here, we consider the intersection of behaviour, ecology and parasite transmission, broadly encompassing micro- and macroparasites. We focus on behaviours that have direct impacts on transmission, as well as the behaviours that result from infection. Given the important role of parasites in host survival and reproduction, the effects of behaviour on parasitism can scale up to population-level processes, thus affecting species conservation. Understanding how conservation and infectious disease control strategies actually affect transmission potential can therefore often only be understood through a behavioural lens. We highlight how behavioural perspectives of disease ecology apply to conservation by reviewing the different ways that behavioural ecology influences parasite transmission and conservation goals. This article is part of the theme issue 'Linking behaviour to dynamics of populations and communities: application of novel approaches in behavioural ecology to conservation'.","1720":"Arboviruses receive heightened research attention during major outbreaks or when they cause unusual or severe clinical disease, but they are otherwise undercharacterized. Global change is also accelerating the emergence and spread of arboviral diseases, leading to time-sensitive questions about potential interactions between viruses and novel vectors. Vector competence experiments help determine the susceptibility of certain arthropods to a given arbovirus, but these experiments are often conducted in real time during outbreaks, rather than with preparedness in mind. We conducted a systematic review of reported mosquito-arbovirus competence experiments, screening 570 abstracts to arrive at 265 studies testing in\u00a0vivo arboviral competence. We found that more than 90% of potential mosquito-virus combinations are untested in experimental settings and that entire regions and their corresponding vectors and viruses are undersampled. These knowledge gaps stymie outbreak response and limit attempts to both build and validate predictive models of the vector-virus network.","1721":"Yearly number of national-level and state-level disease-specific case counts and disease clusters for three diseases (measles, mumps and varicella) during a 5-year study period (2013-2017) across four different data sources: Optum (health insurance billing claims data), HealthMap (online news surveillance data), Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports (official government reports) and National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (government case surveillance data).Our study demonstrated drastic differences in reported infectious disease incidence across data sources. When compared with the other three sources of interest, Optum data showed substantially higher, implausible standardised case counts for all three diseases. Although there was some concordance in identified state-level case counts and disease clusters, all four sources identified variations in state-level reporting.As highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers are eager to make use of a wide variety of data sources, both government-sponsored and alternative, to characterise the epidemiology of infectious diseases. The objective of this study is to investigate the strengths and limitations of sources currently being used for research.Researchers should consider data source limitations when attempting to characterise the epidemiology of infectious diseases. Some data sources, such as billing claims data, may be unsuitable for epidemiological research within the infectious disease context.Retrospective descriptive analysis.","1722":"Since the introduction of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in Malawi in 2011, there has been persistent carriage of vaccine serotype (VT) Streptococcus pneumoniae, despite high vaccine coverage. To determine if there has been a genetic change within the VT capsule polysaccharide (cps) loci since the vaccine's introduction, we compared 1022 whole-genome-sequenced VT isolates from 1998 to 2019. We identified the clonal expansion of a multidrug-resistant, penicillin non-susceptible serotype 23F GPSC14-ST2059 lineage, a serotype 14 GPSC9-ST782 lineage and a novel serotype 14 sequence type GPSC9-ST18728 lineage. Serotype 23F GPSC14-ST2059 had an I253T mutation within the capsule oligosaccharide repeat unit polymerase Wzy protein, which is predicted in silico to alter the protein pocket cavity. Moreover, serotype 23F GPSC14-ST2059 had SNPs in the DNA binding sites for the cps transcriptional repressors CspR and SpxR. Serotype 14 GPSC9-ST782 harbours a non-truncated version of the large repetitive protein (Lrp), containing a Cna protein B-type domain which is also present in proteins associated with infection and colonisation. These emergent lineages also harboured genes associated with antibiotic resistance, and the promotion of colonisation and infection which were absent in other lineages of the same serotype. Together these data suggest that in addition to serotype replacement, modifications of the capsule locus associated with changes in virulence factor expression and antibiotic resistance may promote vaccine escape. In summary, the study highlights that the persistence of vaccine serotype carriage despite high vaccine coverage in Malawi may be partly caused by expansion of VT lineages post-PCV13 rollout.","1723":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of severe respiratory illness and death among children worldwide, particularly in children younger than 6 months and in low-income and middle-income countries. Feasible and cost-effective interventions to prevent RSV disease are not yet widely available, although two new products aimed at preventing RSV disease-long-acting monoclonal antibodies and maternal vaccines-have been licensed within the past 2 years. The primary target of these products is reduction of the substantial burden of RSV-associated acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in infants younger than 1 year. However, other important public health benefits might also accrue with the prevention of RSV-associated LRTI during the first year of life. Mounting evidence shows that preventing RSV-associated LRTI in infants younger than 1 year could prevent secondary pneumonia caused by other pathogens, reduce recurrent hospitalisations due to other respiratory diseases in later childhood, decrease all-cause infant mortality, ameliorate the burden of respiratory diseases on health-care systems, reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, and possibly improve lung health beyond infancy. We herein review current evidence and suggest approaches to better assess the magnitude of these potential secondary effects of RSV prevention, which, if proven substantial, are likely to be relevant to policy makers in many countries as they consider the use of these new products.","1724":"Estimating an infectious disease attack rate requires inference on the number of reported symptomatic cases of a disease, the number of unreported symptomatic cases, and the number of asymptomatic infections. Population-level immunity can then be estimated as the attack rate plus the number of vaccine recipients who had not been previously infected; this requires an estimate of the fraction of vaccines that were distributed to seropositive individuals. To estimate attack rates and population immunity in southern New England, we fit a validated dynamic epidemiological model to case, clinical, and death data streams reported by Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut for the first 15 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, from March 1 2020 to May 31 2021. This period includes the initial spring 2020 wave, the major winter wave of 2020-2021, and the lagging wave of lineage B.1.1.7(Alpha) infections during March-April 2021. In autumn 2020, SARS-CoV-2 population immunity (equal to the attack rate at that point) in southern New England was still below 15%, setting the stage for a large winter wave. After the roll-out of vaccines in early 2021, population immunity in many states was expected to approach 70% by spring 2021, with more than half of this immune population coming from vaccinations. Our population immunity estimates for May 31 2021 are 73.4% (95% CrI: 72.9% - 74.1%) for Rhode Island, 64.1% (95% CrI: 64.0% - 64.4%) for Connecticut, and 66.3% (95% CrI: 65.9% - 66.9%) for Massachusetts, indicating that >33% of southern Englanders were still susceptible to infection when the Delta variant began spreading in July 2021. Despite high vaccine coverage in these states, population immunity in summer 2021 was lower than planned due to 34% (Rhode Island), 25% (Connecticut), and 28% (Massachusetts) of vaccine distribution going to seropositive individuals. Future emergency-setting vaccination planning will likely have to consider over-vaccination as a strategy to ensure that high levels of population immunity are reached during the course of an ongoing epidemic.","1725":"The rapid dynamics of COVID-19 calls for quick and effective tracking of virus transmission chains and early detection of outbreaks, especially in the \"phase 2\" of the pandemic, when lockdown and other restriction measures are progressively withdrawn, in order to avoid or minimize contagion resurgence. For this purpose, contact-tracing apps are being proposed for large scale adoption by many countries. A centralized approach, where data sensed by the app are all sent to a nation-wide server, raises concerns about citizens' privacy and needlessly strong digital surveillance, thus alerting us to the need to minimize personal data collection and avoiding location tracking. We advocate the conceptual advantage of a decentralized approach, where both contact and location data are collected exclusively in individual citizens' \"personal data stores\", to be shared separately and selectively (e.g., with a backend system, but possibly also with other citizens), voluntarily, only when the citizen has tested positive for COVID-19, and with a privacy preserving level of granularity. This approach better protects the personal sphere of citizens and affords multiple benefits: it allows for detailed information gathering for infected people in a privacy-preserving fashion; and, in turn this enables both contact tracing, and, the early detection of outbreak hotspots on more finely-granulated geographic scale. The decentralized approach is also scalable to large populations, in that only the data of positive patients need be handled at a central level. Our recommendation is two-fold. First to extend existing decentralized architectures with a light touch, in order to manage the collection of location data locally on the device, and allow the user to share spatio-temporal aggregates-if and when they want and for specific aims-with health authorities, for instance. Second, we favour a longer-term pursuit of realizing a Personal Data Store vision, giving users the opportunity to contribute to collective good in the measure they want, enhancing self-awareness, and cultivating collective efforts for rebuilding society.","1726":"New direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) provide an opportunity to combat hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in persons who inject drugs (PWID). Here we use a mathematical model to predict the impact of a DAA-treatment scale-up on HCV prevalence among PWID and the estimated cost in metropolitan Chicago.To estimate the HCV antibody and HCV-RNA (chronic infection) prevalence among the metropolitan Chicago PWID population, we used empirical data from three large epidemiological studies. Cost of DAAs is assumed $50,000 per person.Approximately 32,000 PWID reside in metropolitan Chicago with an estimated HCV-RNA prevalence of 47% or 15,040 cases. Approximately 22,000 PWID (69% of the total PWID population) attend harm reduction (HR) programs, such as syringe exchange programs, and have an estimated HCV-RNA prevalence of 30%. There are about 11,000 young PWID (<30 years old) with an estimated HCV-RNA prevalence of 10% (PWID in these two subpopulations overlap). The model suggests that the following treatment scale-up is needed to reduce the baseline HCV-RNA prevalence by one-half over 10 years of treatment [cost per year, min-max in millions]: 35 per 1,000 [$50-$77] in the overall PWID population, 19 per 1,000 [$20-$26] for persons in HR programs, and 5 per 1,000 [$3-$4] for young PWID.Treatment scale-up could dramatically reduce the prevalence of chronic HCV infection among PWID in Chicago, who are the main reservoir for on-going HCV transmission. Focusing treatment on PWID attending HR programs and\/or young PWID could have a significant impact on HCV prevalence in these subpopulations at an attainable cost.","1727":"Dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota has been shown to result in altered immune responses and increased susceptibility to infection; as such, the state of the intestinal microbiome may have profound implications in the perioperative setting. In this first-in-class study, we used 16s ribosomal RNA sequencing and analysis in a mouse model of general anesthesia to investigate the effects of volatile anesthetics on the diversity and composition of the intestinal microbiome. After 4-hour exposure to isoflurane, we observed a decrease in bacterial diversity. Taxonomic alterations included depletion of several commensal bacteria including Clostridiales. These data identify volatile anesthetics as potential contributors to microbial dysbiosis in the postoperative patient.","1728":"Phylogenetic dating is one of the most powerful and commonly used methods of drawing epidemiological interpretations from pathogen genomic data. Building such trees requires considering a molecular clock model which represents the rate at which substitutions accumulate on genomes. When the molecular clock rate is constant throughout the tree then the clock is said to be strict, but this is often not an acceptable assumption. Alternatively, relaxed clock models consider variations in the clock rate, often based on a distribution of rates for each branch. However, we show here that the distributions of rates across branches in commonly used relaxed clock models are incompatible with the biological expectation that the sum of the numbers of substitutions on two neighbouring branches should be distributed as the substitution number on a single branch of equivalent length. We call this expectation the additivity property. We further show how assumptions of commonly used relaxed clock models can lead to estimates of evolutionary rates and dates with low precision and biased confidence intervals. We therefore propose a new additive relaxed clock model where the additivity property is satisfied. We illustrate the use of our new additive relaxed clock model on a range of simulated and real datasets, and we show that using this new model leads to more accurate estimates of mean evolutionary rates and ancestral dates.","1729":"Here we coin the term synanthrome to describe all of the species we interact with. We propose that the time is now here for The Global Synanthrome Project to describe all of our interacting species and how they have changed through time and across space. This effort must involve natural history, ecology, and evolutionary biology in addition to genomics studies that are already underway.","1730":"An association between malaria and risk for death among patients with Ebola virus disease has suggested within-host interactions between Plasmodium falciparum parasites and Ebola virus. To determine whether such an interaction might also influence the probability of acquiring either infection, we used a large snapshot surveillance study from rural Gabon to test if past exposure to Ebola virus is associated with current infection with Plasmodium spp. during nonepidemic conditions. We found a strong positive association, on population and individual levels, between seropositivity for antibodies against Ebola virus and the presence of Plasmodium parasites in the blood. According to a multiple regression model accounting for other key variables, antibodies against Ebola virus emerged as the strongest individual-level risk factor for acquiring malaria. Our results suggest that within-host interactions between malaria parasites and Ebola virus may underlie epidemiologic associations.","1731":"The analysis performed highlighted the amplifying effect of mass gathering on N. meningitidis transmission and confirm vaccination as a very effective preventive measure to mitigate outbreak risks.We developed a meta-population model to represent the transmission dynamics of Neisseria meningitidis and the impact of Hajj pilgrimage on the risk of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) for pilgrims population, local population at the Hajj site and country of origin of Hajj pilgrims. This model was calibrated using data on IMD over 17 years (1995-2011) and further used to simulate potential changes in vaccine policy and endemic conditions.Mass gatherings can not only trigger major outbreaks on-site but also facilitate global spread of infectious pathogens. Hajj is one of the largest mass gathering events worldwide where over two million pilgrims from all over the world gather annually creating intense congestion.The effect of increased density of contacts during Hajj was estimated to generate a 78-fold increase in disease transmission that impacts not only pilgrims but also the local population. Quadrivalent ACWY vaccination was found to be very effective in reducing the risk of outbreak during Hajj. Hajj has more limited impact on IMD transmission and exportation in the pilgrim countries of origin, although not negligible given the size of the population considered.","1732":"PCME occurs frequently in uveitic eyes undergoing cataract surgery, however, most resolve within a year. CME recurrences likely are due to the underlying disease process and not relapses of PCME.PCME causing VA 20\/50 or worse was reported in 286 eyes (15%) within 6 months of surgery. Adults age 18-64 years as compared to children (adjusted Odds ratio (aOR) 2.42, for ages 18-44 and aOR 1.93 for ages 45-64, overall p\u202f=\u202f0.02); concurrent use of systemic immunosuppression (conventional aOR 1.53 and biologics aOR 2.68, overall p =0.0095); pre-operative VA 20\/50 or worse (overall p <0.0001); cataract surgery performed before 2000 (overall p=0.03) and PMCE in fellow eye (aOR 3.04, p=0.0004) were associated with development of PCME within 6 months of cataract surgery. PCME resolution was seen in 81% of eyes at 12 months and 91% of eyes at 24 months. CME relapse was seen in 12% eyes at 12 months and 19% eyes at 24 months.A total of 1859 eyes that had no visually significant macular edema prior to cataract surgery while under tertiary uveitis management were included. Standardized retrospective chart review was used to gather clinical data.

While the spread of pathogens transcends geographical boundaries, the management of infectious diseases typically occurs within distinct spatial units, determined by geopolitical boundaries. The allocation of management resources within and across regions (the \"governance structure\") can affect epidemiological outcomes considerably, and policy-makers are often confronted with a choice between applying control measures uniformly or differentially across regions. Here, we investigate the extent to which uniform and non-uniform governance structures affect the costs of an infectious disease outbreak in two-patch systems using an optimal control framework. A uniform policy implements control measures with the same time varying rate functions across both patches, while these measures are allowed to differ between the patches in a non-uniform policy. We compare results from two systems of differential equations representing transmission of cholera and Ebola, respectively, to understand the interplay between transmission mode, governance structure and the optimal control of outbreaks. In our case studies, the governance structure has a meaningful impact on the allocation of resources and burden of cases, although the difference in total costs is minimal. Understanding how governance structure affects both the optimal control functions and epidemiological outcomes is crucial for the effective management of infectious diseases going forward.","1735":"For antigenically variable pathogens such as influenza, strain fitness is partly determined by the relative availability of hosts susceptible to infection with that strain compared to others. Antibodies to the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) confer substantial protection against influenza infection. We asked if a cross-sectional antibody-derived estimate of population susceptibility to different clades of influenza A (H3N2) could predict the success of clades in the following season. We collected sera from 483 healthy individuals aged 1 to 90 years in the summer of 2017 and analyzed neutralizing responses to the HA and NA of representative strains. The clade to which neutralizing antibody titers were lowest, indicating greater population susceptibility, dominated the next season. Titers to different HA and NA clades varied dramatically between individuals but showed significant associations with age, suggesting dependence on correlated past exposures. Despite this correlation, inter-individual variability in antibody titers to H3N2 strains increased gradually with age. This study indicates how representative measures of population immunity might improve evolutionary forecasts and inform selective pressures on influenza.","1736":"In early 2020, the response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions, some of which aimed to reduce transmission by changing mixing patterns between people. Aggregated location data from mobile phones are an important source of real-time information about human mobility on a population level, but the degree to which these mobility metrics capture the relevant contact patterns of individuals at risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 is not clear. In this study we describe changes in the relationship between mobile phone data and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the USA. values with mobility proxies.There was no funding source for this study.We show that the reproduction number is most strongly associated with mobility proxies for change in the travel into counties (0\u00b7757 [95% CI 0\u00b7689 to 0\u00b7857]), but this relationship primarily holds for counties in the three most urban categories as defined by the NCHS. This relationship weakens considerably after the initial 15 weeks of the epidemic (0\u00b7442 [-0\u00b7492 to -0\u00b7392]), consistent with the emergence of more complex local policies and behaviours, including masking.. Importantly, we highlight potential issues in the data generation process for transmission indicators derived from mobile phone data, representativeness, and equity of access, which must be addressed to improve the interpretability of these data in public health.","1737":"To quantify trends in racial\/ethnic disparities in TB incidence among U.S.-born persons.U.S.-born persons stratified by race\/ethnicity.Elevated tuberculosis (TB) incidence rates have recently been reported for racial\/ethnic minority populations in the United States.

Analyses were stratified by sex and by attribution of TB disease to recent transmission and were adjusted for age, year, and state of residence.Time-series analysis of national TB registry data for 2011 to 2021.There are persistent disparities in TB incidence by race\/ethnicity. Relative disparities were greater for AI\/AN persons, females, and younger persons, and absolute disparities were greater for males. Eliminating these disparities could reduce overall TB incidence by more than 60% among the U.S.-born population.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.In analyses of TB incidence rates for each racial\/ethnic population compared with non-Hispanic White persons, incidence rate ratios were as high as 14.2 (95% CI, 13.0 to 15.5) among American Indian or Alaska Native (AI\/AN) females. Relative disparities were greater for females, younger persons, and TB attributed to recent transmission. Absolute disparities were greater for males. Excess TB cases in 2011 to 2021 represented 69% (CI, 66% to 71%) and 62% (CI, 60% to 64%) of total cases for females and males, respectively. No evidence was found to indicate that incidence rate ratios decreased over time, and most relative disparity measures showed small, statistically nonsignificant increases.United States.Analyses assumed complete TB case diagnosis and self-report of race\/ethnicity and were not adjusted for medical comorbidities or social determinants of health.","1738":" = 0.001). This effect persisted after controlling for identified confounders. These data indicate that vancomycin heteroresistance is common in CoNS isolates from CLABSIs in pediatric patients with leukemia and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Validation of these findings in an independent cohort and evaluation of alternative antibiotic therapy in patients with heteroresistant infections has the potential to improve care for serious CoNS infections.","1739":"Close contacts between individuals provide opportunities for the transmission of diseases, including COVID-19. While individuals take part in many different types of interactions, including those with classmates, co-workers and household members, it is the conglomeration of all of these interactions that produces the complex social contact network interconnecting individuals across the population. Thus, while an individual might decide their own risk tolerance in response to a threat of infection, the consequences of such decisions are rarely so confined, propagating far beyond any one person. We assess the effect of different population-level risk-tolerance regimes, population structure in the form of age and household-size distributions, and different interaction types on epidemic spread in plausible human contact networks to gain insight into how contact network structure affects pathogen spread through a population. In particular, we find that behavioural changes by vulnerable individuals in isolation are insufficient to reduce those individuals' infection risk and that population structure can have varied and counteracting effects on epidemic outcomes. The relative impact of each interaction type was contingent on assumptions underlying contact network construction, stressing the importance of empirical validation. Taken together, these results promote a nuanced understanding of disease spread on contact networks, with implications for public health strategies.","1740":"Performance scores varied greatly by LHDs and EPHSs; however, LHDs typically scored <50, indicating that they performed fewer than half of the activities evaluated. LHDs that served larger populations (vs smaller populations) and LHDs that had higher per-capita funding (vs lower per-capita funding) had higher EPHS scores. We identified 6 EPHS performance score-based LHD clusters, which suggests similarities in which EPHSs LHDs focused on.Our results suggest weaknesses in many LHDs' fulfillment of the EPHSs, particularly in low-population and low-funding settings. LHDs should be given the resources to increase capacity and ensure the EPHSs are met in communities.Despite a push for increased local public health capacity, no clear baseline for performance of local health departments (LHDs) exists. The objectives of this study were to quantify the self-reported performance of LHDs on the 10 Essential Public Health Services (EPHSs) and describe the relationships between performance and characteristics of LHDs.We used data on 2000 LHDs from the 2013 National Profile of Local Health Departments survey to develop principal components analysis-based scores to evaluate each LHD on the performance of EPHSs. Scores ranged from 0 to 100. LHDs that performed no activities within an EPHS had a score of 0, and LHDs that performed all activities within an EPHS had a score of 100. We explored the relationships between EPHS scores and LHD characteristics by using multivariate linear regression and cluster analysis.","1741":"Overall household SAR for SARS-CoV-2, SAR by covariates (contact age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and relationship; index case age, sex, symptom status, presence of fever, and presence of cough; number of contacts; study location; and variant), and SAR by index case identification period.The findings of this study suggest that the household remains an important site of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and recent studies have higher household SAR estimates compared with the earliest reports. More transmissible variants and vaccines may be associated with further changes.A previous systematic review and meta-analysis of household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 that summarized 54 published studies through October 19, 2020, found an overall secondary attack rate (SAR) of 16.6% (95% CI, 14.0%-19.3%). However, the understanding of household secondary attack rates for SARS-CoV-2 is still evolving, and updated analysis is needed.A total of 2722 records (2710 records from database searches and 12 records from the reference lists of eligible articles) published between October 20, 2020, and June 17, 2021, were identified. Of those, 93 full-text articles reporting household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 were assessed for eligibility, and 37 studies were included. These 37 new studies were combined with 50 of the 54 studies (published through October 19, 2020) from our previous review (4 studies from Wuhan, China, were excluded because their study populations overlapped with another recent study), resulting in a total of 87 studies representing 1\u202f249\u202f163 household contacts from 30 countries. The estimated household SAR for all 87 studies was 18.9% (95% CI, 16.2%-22.0%).

Results from subgroup analyses were similar to those reported in a previous systematic review and meta-analysis; however, the SAR was higher to contacts with comorbidities (3 studies; 50.0% [95% CI, 41.4%-58.6%]) compared with previous findings, and the estimated household SAR for the B.1.1.7 (\u03b1) variant was 24.5% (3 studies; 95% CI, 10.9%-46.2%).PubMed and reference lists of eligible articles were used to search for records published between October 20, 2020, and June 17, 2021.

Opportunities for such experiments are rare but do arise in the context of restoration ecology-where different \"types\" of a given species can be introduced into different \"replicate\" locations. Designing such experiments requires wrestling with consequential questions. (Q1) Which specific \"types\" of a focal species should be introduced to the restoration location? (Q2) How many sources of each type should be used-and should they be mixed together? (Q3) Which specific source populations should be used? (Q4) Which type(s) or population(s) should be introduced into which restoration sites? We recently grappled with these questions when designing an eco-evolutionary experiment with threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) introduced into nine small lakes and ponds on the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska that required restoration. After considering the options at length, we decided to use benthic versus limnetic ecotypes (Q1) to create a mixed group of colonists from four source populations of each ecotype (Q2), where ecotypes were identified based on trophic morphology (Q3), and were then introduced into nine restoration lakes scaled by lake size (Q4). We hope that outlining the alternatives and resulting choices will make\u00a0the rationales clear for future studies leveraging our experiment, while also proving useful for investigators considering similar experiments in the future.","1744":"A total of 4,125 pediatric patients were identified.

Demographic, hospital variable, hospital complications and LOS were collected. A linear and logistic multivariate regression analyses was performed to determine the risk-ratio for hospital LOS as well as complication rate, respectively.This study aimed to investigate the impact of race on hospital length of stay (LOS) and hospital complications among pediatric patients with cervical\/thoracic injury.Race may significantly impact healthcare resource utilization following pediatric cervical\/thoracic spinal trauma.","1745":"), a crucial determinate of vector control efficacy.Mosquito control has the potential to significantly reduce malaria burden on a region, but to influence public health policy must also show cost-effectiveness. Gaps in our knowledge of mosquito population dynamics mean that mathematical modelling of vector control interventions have typically made simplifying assumptions about key aspects of mosquito ecology. Often, these assumptions can distort the predicted efficacy of vector control, particularly next-generation tools such as gene drive, which are highly sensitive to local mosquito dynamics.We developed a discrete-time stochastic mathematical model of mosquito population dynamics to explore the fine-scale behaviour of egg-laying and larval density dependence on parameter estimation. The model was fitted to longitudinal mosquito population count data using particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.Subsequent application of these new parameter estimates to gene drive models show how the understanding and implementation of fine-scale processes, when deriving parameter estimates, may have a profound influence on successful vector control. The consequences of this may be of crucial interest when devising future public health policy.","1746":" parameter.

Many of the models used in these studies are based on the model of Legrand et\u00a0al. (2007), and most failed to accurately project the outbreak's course (Butler, 2014). Although there could be many reasons for this, including incomplete and unreliable data on Ebola epidemiology and lack of empirical data on how disease-control measures quantitatively affect Ebola transmission, we examine the underlying assumptions of the Legrand model, and provide alternate formulations that are simpler and provide additional information regarding the epidemiology of Ebola during an outbreak. We developed three models with different assumptions about disease stage durations, one of which simplifies to the Legrand model while the others have more realistic distributions. Control and basic reproduction numbers for all three models are derived and shown to provide threshold conditions for outbreak control and prevention.","1748":"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of pneumonia and meningitis worldwide. Many different serotypes co-circulate endemically in any one location. The extent and mechanisms of spread, and vaccine-driven changes in fitness and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), remain largely unquantified. Using geolocated genome sequences from South Africa (N=6910, 2000-2014) we developed models to reconstruct spread, pairing detailed human mobility data and genomic data. Separately we estimated the population level changes in fitness of strains that are (vaccine type, VT) and are not (non-vaccine type, NVT) included in the vaccine, first implemented in 2009, as well as differences in strain fitness between those that are and are not resistant to penicillin. We estimated that pneumococci only become homogenously mixed across South Africa after about 50 years of transmission, with the slow spread driven by the focal nature of human mobility. Further, in the years following vaccine implementation the relative fitness of NVT compared to VT strains increased (RR: 1.29 [95% CI 1.20-1.37]) - with an increasing proportion of these NVT strains becoming penicillin resistant. Our findings point to highly entrenched, slow transmission and indicate that initial vaccine-linked decreases in AMR may be transient.","1749":" being less fit in host plants but more fit in a non-host interaction.","1750":"Regionally-resolved effect estimates of unit increases in temperature on net all-cause mortality risk were generated through random-effects pooling of studies identified through a systematic review.Avoiding excess health damages attributable to climate change is a primary motivator for policy interventions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the health benefits of climate mitigation, as included in the policy assessment process, have been estimated without much input from health experts.In accordance with recommendations from the National Academies in a 2017 report on approaches to update the social cost of greenhouse gases (SC-GHG), an expert panel of 26 health researchers and climate economists gathered for a virtual technical workshop in May 2021 to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis and recommend improvements to the estimation of health impacts in economic-climate models.Effect estimates, and associated uncertainties, varied by global region, but net increases in mortality risk associated with increased average annual temperatures (ranging from 0.1-1.1% per 1 degree C) was estimated for all global regions. Key recommendations for the development and utilization of health damage modules were provided by the expert panel, and include: not relying on individual methodologies in estimating health damages; incorporating a broader range of cause-specific mortality impacts; improving the climate parameters available in economic models; accounting for socio-economic trajectories and adaptation factors when estimating health damages; and carefully considering how air pollution impacts should be incorporated in economic-climate models.This work provides an example for how subject-matter experts can work alongside climate economists in making continued improvements to SC-GHG estimates.","1751":"RDS was used to recruit PWUD across seven Rural Opioid Initiative studies between 2018-2020. To evaluate RDS assumptions, we computed recruitment homophily and design effects, generated convergence and bottleneck plots, and tested for recruitment and degree differences. We compared sample proportions with three RDS-adjusted estimators (two variations of RDS-I and RDS-II) for five variables of interest (past 30-day use of heroin, fentanyl, and methamphetamine; past 6-month homelessness; and being positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody) using linear regression with robust confidence intervals. We compared regression estimates for the associations between HCV positive antibody status and (a) heroin use, (b) fentanyl use, and (c) age using RDS-1 and RDS-II probability weights and no weights using logistic and modified Poisson regression and random-effects meta-analyses.Accurate prevalence estimates of drug use and its harms are important to characterize burden and develop interventions to reduce negative health outcomes and disparities. Lack of a sampling frame for marginalized\/stigmatized populations, including persons who use drugs (PWUD) in rural settings, makes this challenging. Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is frequently used to recruit PWUD. However, the validity of RDS-generated population-level prevalence estimates relies on assumptions that should be evaluated.RDS was a useful recruitment tool for PWUD in rural settings. However, several violations of key RDS assumptions were observed which slightly impacts estimation of proportion although not associations.Among 2,842 PWUD, median age was 34 years and 43% were female. Most participants (54%) reported opioids as their drug of choice, however regional differences were present (e.g., methamphetamine range: 4-52%). Many recruitment chains were not long enough to achieve sample equilibrium. Recruitment homophily was present for some variables. Differences with respect to recruitment and degree varied across studies. Prevalence estimates varied only slightly with different RDS weighting approaches, most confidence intervals overlapped. Variations in measures of association varied little based on weighting approach.","1752":"One-dose routine vaccination could avert most of the cervical cancers averted with two-dose vaccination while being more efficient, provided the duration of one-dose protection is greater than 20-30 years (depending on the LMIC). The doses saved by introducing one-dose routine vaccination could offer the opportunity to vaccinate girls before they age out of the vaccination window of 9-14 years and, potentially, to vaccinate boys or older age groups.Assuming non-inferior vaccine characteristics for one dose compared with two doses, the model projections show that two-dose or one-dose routine vaccination of girls aged 9 years (with a multi-age cohort vaccination of girls aged 10-14 years) would avert 12\u00b70 million (80% UI 9\u00b75-14\u00b75) cervical cancers in India, 4\u00b77 million (3\u00b74-5\u00b78) in Nigeria, 2\u00b73 million (1\u00b79-2\u00b76) in Uganda, and 0\u00b74 million (0\u00b72-0\u00b75) in Viet Nam over 100 years. Under pessimistic assumptions of lower one-dose efficacy (85%) or a shorter duration of protection (ie, 30 years), one-dose routine vaccination would avert 69% (61-80) to 94% (92-96) of the cervical cancers averted with two-dose routine vaccination. However, when assuming a duration of protection of 20 years, one-dose routine vaccination would avert substantially fewer cervical cancers (ie, 35% [26-44] to 69% [65-71] of the cervical cancers averted with two-dose routine vaccination). A switch from one-dose to two-dose routine vaccination of girls aged 9 years, with a one-dose catch-up of girls aged 10-14 years, 5 years after the start of the vaccination programme, could mitigate potential losses in cervical cancer prevention from a short one-dose duration of protection (averting 92% [83-98] to 99% [97-100]) of the cervical cancers averted with two-dose routine vaccination). One-dose routine vaccination would result in fewer doses needed to prevent one cervical cancer than two-dose routine vaccination, even if the duration of protection is as low as 20 years. Finally, for countries with two-dose routine vaccination, adding one-dose multi-age cohort vaccination in the first year would provide similar benefits as a two-dose multi-age cohort vaccination, and would be more efficient even under the pessimistic assumptions of lower one-dose vaccine efficacy or duration of protection.Fonds de recherche du Qu\u00e9bec-Sant\u00e9, Digital Research Alliance of Canada, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.In this mathematical modelling study, we used HPV-ADVISE LMIC, an individual-based transmission-dynamic model independently calibrated to four epidemiologically diverse low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs; India, Nigeria, Uganda, and Viet Nam). We parameterised and calibrated the model using sexual behaviour and epidemiological data identified from international population-based datasets and the literature. All base-case vaccination scenarios start in 2023 with the nonavalent vaccine and assumed 80% vaccination coverage with one or two doses. We assumed that two doses of vaccine provide 100% efficacy against vaccine-type infections and a lifelong duration of protection. We examined a non-inferior vaccination scenario for one dose compared with two doses, pessimistic scenarios of lower one-dose vaccine efficacy (85%) or a shorter duration of protection (ie, 20 or 30 years), and the effectiveness of a mitigation scenario in which schedules would switch from one dose to two doses. We also did sensitivity analyses by varying vaccination coverage. We used three outcomes: the relative reduction in cervical cancer incidence, the number of cervical cancers averted, and the number of vaccine doses needed to prevent one cervical cancer.Given the accumulating evidence that one-dose vaccination could provide high and sustained protection against human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and related diseases, we examined the population-level effectiveness and efficiency of one-dose HPV vaccination of girls compared with two-dose vaccination, using mathematical modelling.","1753":"How we define \"current use\" of tobacco and nicotine delivery products changes our estimates of how individuals transition to, between, and from different patterns of use. We show that the robustness of transition estimates to whether or not non-established users are included as current users and to different frequency-of-use threshold depends in part on whether low-frequency users are categorized as non-current users or as a distinct category. Our results emphasize the importance of intentional definitions of product use that reflect the larger goals of public health and tobacco control.Product use definitions have important implications for assessing product use transitions and thus the public health implications of cigarette and ENDS control strategies.When treating use below a frequency threshold as non-current use, transition probability estimates were largely robust to the choice of use frequency threshold, although sole ENDS users were more likely to transition to non-current use or dual use as the current use threshold increased. Removing the established-use criterion for ENDS reduced the estimates of sole ENDS and dual users staying in their use state. When treating infrequent use as a separate category, transition probability estimates were dependent on the use frequency threshold, particularly transitions among the dual use states.Definitions of current tobacco and nicotine delivery product use vary and depend on frequency of use, established use criteria, and the product type. Previous research has not considered how transition rates between current use of different products depend on the current use definition.We applied a multistate transition model to data on US adults from Waves 1-4 (2013- 17) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study. We estimated transition rates between never, non-current, cigarette, electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS), and dual use states with and without established-use criteria (has smoked 100+ cigarettes in their lifetime; ever fairly regularly used ENDS) and different frequency thresholds (1+, 10+, 20+, and 30 days of the past 30 days). We considered use below a frequency threshold as either non-current use or a distinct, infrequent use category.","1754":"We analyzed time series data on rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) and all-cause acute gastroenteritis (AGE) hospitalization rates in the United States from the MarketScan\u00ae Research Databases for July 2001-June 2016. Individuals were grouped into ages 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-24, 25-44, and 45-64\u2009years. Negative binomial regression models were fitted to monthly RVGE and AGE data to estimate the direct, indirect, overall, and total VE.A total of 9211 RVGE and 726,528 AGE hospitalizations were analyzed. Children 0-4\u2009years of age had the largest declines in RVGE hospitalizations with direct VE of 87% (95% CI: 83, 90%). Substantial indirect effects were observed across age groups and generally declined in each older group. Overall VE against RVGE hospitalizations for all ages combined was 69% (95% CI: 62, 76%). Total VE was highest among young children; a vaccinated child in the post-vaccine era has a 95% reduced risk of RVGE hospitalization compared to a child in the pre-vaccine era. We observed higher direct VE in odd post-vaccine years and an opposite pattern for indirect VE.Vaccine benefits extended to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, suggesting infants are important drivers of disease transmission across the population. Imperfect disease classification and changing disease incidence may lead to bias in observed direct VE.The direct effectiveness of infant rotavirus vaccination implemented in 2006 in the United States has been evaluated extensively, however, understanding of population-level vaccine effectiveness (VE) is still incomplete.Not applicable.","1755":"Under a range of assumptions, introducing novel TB vaccines would increase economic growth in LMICs.Most individuals developing tuberculosis (TB) are working age adults living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The resulting disability and death impact economic productivity and burden health systems. New TB vaccine products may reduce this burden. In this study, we estimated the impact of introducing novel TB vaccines on gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 105 LMICs.We adapted an existing macroeconomic model to simulate country-level GDP trends between 2020 and 2080, comparing scenarios for introduction of hypothetical infant and adolescent\/adult vaccines to a no-new-vaccine counterfactual. We parameterized each scenario using estimates of TB-related mortality, morbidity, and healthcare spending from linked epidemiological and costing models. We assumed vaccines would be introduced between 2028 and 2047 and estimated incremental changes in GDP within each country from introduction to 2080, in 2020 US dollars. We tested the robustness of results to alternative analytic specifications. Both vaccine scenarios produced greater cumulative GDP in the modeled countries over the study period, equivalent to $1.6 (95% uncertainty interval: $0.8, 3.0) trillion for the adolescent\/adult vaccine and $0.2 ($0.1, 0.4) trillion for the infant vaccine. These GDP gains were substantially lagged relative to the time of vaccine introduction, particularly for the infant vaccine. GDP gains resulting from vaccine introduction were concentrated in countries with higher current TB incidence and earlier vaccine introduction. Results were sensitive to secular trends in GDP growth but relatively robust to other analytic assumptions. Uncertain projections of GDP could alter these projections and affect the conclusions drawn by this analysis.","1756":" perspective. We show how known AMR protein variants tend to correspond to exposed residues, while on the contrary their susceptible counterparts tend to be buried. Based on these findings, we develop RSA-AMR, a novel relative solvent accessibility-based AMR scoring system. This scoring system can be applied to any protein variant to estimate its propensity of altering the relative solvent accessibility, and potentially conferring (or hindering) AMR. We show how RSA-AMR score can be integrated with existing AMR detection algorithms to expand their range of applicability into detecting potential novel AMR variants, and provide a ten-fold increase in Specificity. The two main limitations of RSA-AMR score is that it is designed on single point changes, and a limited number of variants was available for model learning.","1757":"Prevalence, incidence, asexual parasite and gametocyte densities, and infectiousness measurements from eight study sites in sub-Saharan Africa were used to calibrate an individual-based model with innate and adaptive immunity. Data from the Garki Project was used to fit exposure rates and parasite densities with month-resolution. A model capturing Garki seasonality and seasonal heterogeneity of exposure was used as a framework for characterizing the infectious reservoir of malaria, testing optimal timing of indoor residual spraying, and comparing four possible mass drug campaign implementations for malaria control.Malaria transmission is both seasonal and heterogeneous, and mathematical models that seek to predict the effects of possible intervention strategies should accurately capture realistic seasonality of vector abundance, seasonal dynamics of within-host effects, and heterogeneity of exposure, which may also vary seasonally.Accounting for heterogeneity and seasonality in malaria transmission is critical for understanding transmission dynamics and predicting optimal timing and targeting of control and elimination interventions.Seasonality as observed in Garki sites is neither sinusoidal nor box-like, and substantial heterogeneity in exposure arises from dry-season biting. Individuals with dry-season exposure likely account for the bulk of the infectious reservoir during the dry season even when they are a minority in the overall population. Spray campaigns offer the most benefit in prevalence reduction when implemented just prior to peak vector abundance, which may occur as late as a couple months into the wet season, and targeting spraying to homes of individuals with dry-season exposure can be particularly effective. Expanding seasonal malaria chemoprevention programs to cover older children is predicted to increase the number of cases averted per treatment and is therefore recommended for settings of seasonal and intense transmission.","1758":"Given a contact network and coarse-grained diagnostic information such as electronic Healthcare Reimbursement Claims (eHRC) data, can we develop efficient intervention policies from data to control an epidemic? Immunization is an important problem in multiple areas, especially epidemiology and public health. However, most existing studies rely on assuming prior epidemiological models to develop pre-emptive strategies, which may fail to adapt to the change in new epidemiological patterns and the availability of rich data such as eHRC. In practice, disease spread is usually complicated, hence assuming an underlying model may deviate from true spreading patterns, leading to possibly inaccurate interventions. Additionally, the abundance of health care surveillance data (such as eHRC) makes it possible to study data-driven strategies without too many restrictive assumptions. Hence, such a data-driven intervention approach can help public-health experts take more practical decisions. In this paper, we take into account propagation log and contact networks for controlling propagation. Different from previous model-based approaches, our solutions are solely data driven in a sense that we develop immunization strategies directly from the network and eHRC without assuming classical epidemiological models. In particular, we formulate the novel and challenging data-driven immunization problem. To solve it, we first propose an efficient sampling approach to align surveillance data with contact networks, then develop an efficient algorithm with the provably approximate guarantee for immunization. Finally, we show the effectiveness and scalability of our methods via extensive experiments on multiple datasets, and conduct case studies on nation-wide real medical surveillance data.","1759":"The United States (U.S.) environmental regulatory system relies heavily on self-reports to assess compliance among regulated facilities. However, the regulatory agencies have expressed concerns regarding the potential for fraud in self-reports and suggested that the likelihood of detection in the federal and state enforcement processes is low. In this paper, we apply Benford\u0092s Law to three years of self-reported discharge parameters from wastewater treatment plant facilities in one U.S. state. We conclude that Benford\u0092s Law alone may not be a reliable method for detecting potential data mishandling for individual facility\u0096parameter combinations, but may provide information about the types of parameters most likely to be fraudulently reported and types of facilities most likely to do so. From a regulatory perspective, this information may help to prioritise potential fraud risks in self reporting and better direct limited resources.","1760":"We study the algorithmic problem of finding the most \"scale-free-like\" spanning tree of a connected graph. This problem is motivated by the fundamental problem of genomic epidemiology: given viral genomes sampled from infected individuals, reconstruct the transmission network (\"who infected whom\"). We use two possible objective functions for this problem and introduce the corresponding algorithmic problems termedm-SF (-scale free) ands-SF Spanning Tree problems. We prove that those problems are APX- and NP-hard, respectively, even in the classes of cubic and bipartite graphs. We propose two integer linear programming (ILP) formulations for thes-SF Spanning Tree problem, and experimentally assess its performance using simulated and experimental data. In particular, we demonstrate that the ILP-based approach allows for accurate reconstruction of transmission histories of several hepatitis C outbreaks.","1761":"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, control of transmission has been repeatedly thwarted by the emergence of variants of concern (VOC) and their geographic spread. Key questions remain regarding effective means of minimizing the impact of VOC, in particular the feasibility of containing them at source, in light of global interconnectedness. By analysing a stochastic transmission model of COVID-19, we identify the appropriate monitoring requirements that make containment at source feasible. Specifically, precise risk assessment informed primarily by epidemiological indicators (e.g. accumulated hospitalization or mortality reports), is unlikely prior to VOC escape. Consequently, decision makers will need to make containment decisions without confident severity estimates. In contrast, successfully identifying and containing variants via genomic surveillance is realistic, provided sequence processing and dissemination is prompt.","1762":"Measuring and reporting the different population-level effects of the acellular pertussis vaccine on pertussis disease in addition to direct effects can increase the cost-effectiveness of a vaccine.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children born between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2017, in King County, Washington, who were enrolled in the Washington State Immunization Information System. Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular-Pertussis (DTaP) vaccination data from WA-IIS was linked with pertussis case data from Public Health Seattle and King County. Census-level vaccination coverage was estimated as proportion of age-appropriately vaccinated children residing in it. Direct vaccine effectiveness was estimated by comparing pertussis risk in fully-vaccinated and under-vaccinated children. Population-level vaccine effects were estimated by comparing pertussis risk in census tracts in the highest vaccination coverage quartile to that in the lowest vaccination coverage quartile.Our findings suggest that DTaP vaccination provided direct as well as indirect protection in the highly immunized King County, WA. Routine DTaP vaccination programs may have the potential to provide not only protection for vaccinated individuals but also for the under-vaccinated individuals living in the same area.For direct protection, estimated vaccine effectiveness was 76% (95% CI: 63% - 84%) in low vaccination coverage clusters and it decreased to 47% (95% CI: 13% - 68%) in high vaccination coverage clusters, after adjusting for potential confounders. The estimated indirect effect was 45.0% (95% CI: 1%, 70%), total effect was 93.9% (95% CI: 91%, 96%), and overall effect was 42.2% (95% CI: 19%, 60%).","1763":"Estimating malaria risk associated with work locations and travel across a region provides local health officials with information useful to mitigate possible transmission paths of malaria as well as understand the risk of exposure for local populations. This study investigates malaria exposure risk by analysing the spatial pattern of malaria cases (primarily Plasmodium vivax) in Ubon Ratchathani and Sisaket provinces of Thailand, using an ecological niche model and machine learning to estimate the species distribution of P. vivax malaria and compare the resulting niche areas with occupation type, work locations, and work-related travel routes.A maximum entropy model was trained to estimate the distribution of P. vivax malaria for a period between January 2019 and April 2020, capturing estimated malaria occurrence for these provinces. A random simulation workflow was developed to make region-based case data usable for the machine learning approach. This workflow was used to generate a probability surface for the ecological niche regions. The resulting niche regions were analysed by occupation type, home and work locations, and work-related travel routes to determine the relationship between these variables and malaria occurrence. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used to understand the relationship between predicted malaria occurrence and occupation type.The MaxEnt (full name) model indicated a higher occurrence of P. vivax malaria in forested areas especially along the Thailand-Cambodia border. The ANOVA results showed a statistically significant difference between average malaria risk values predicted from the ecological niche model for rubber plantation workers and farmers, the two main occupation groups in the study. The rubber plantation workers were found to be at higher risk of exposure to malaria than farmers in Ubon Ratchathani and Sisaket provinces of Thailand.The results from this study point to occupation-related factors such as work location and the routes travelled to work, being risk factors in malaria occurrence and possible contributors to transmission among local populations.","1764":"The recent emergence of A(H7N9) avian influenza poses a significant challenge to public health in China and around the world; however, understanding of the transmission dynamics and progression of influenza A(H7N9) infection in domestic poultry, as well as spillover transmission to humans, remains limited. Here, we develop a mathematical model-Bayesian inference system which combines a simple epidemic model and data assimilation method, and use it in conjunction with data on observed human influenza A(H7N9) cases from 19 February 2013 to 19 September 2015 to estimate key epidemiological parameters and to forecast infection in both poultry and humans. Our findings indicate a high outbreak attack rate of 33% among poultry but a low rate of chicken-to-human spillover transmission. In addition, we generated accurate forecasts of the peak timing and magnitude of human influenza A(H7N9) cases. This work demonstrates that transmission dynamics within an avian reservoir can be estimated and that real-time forecast of spillover avian influenza in humans is possible.","1765":"Malaria in pregnancy (MIP) causes poor birth outcomes, but its impact on neurocognitive development has not been well characterized. Between 2012 and 2014, we enrolled 307 mother-infant pairs and monitored 286 infants for neurocognitive development using the Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool at 6, 12, and 24 months of age. MIP was diagnosed from peripheral blood and placental specimens. Cord blood cytokine levels were assessed for a subset of neonates. Predictors of neurodevelopment were examined using mixed-effect logistic regression for developmental delay. Among the participants, 78 mothers (25.4%) had MIP, and 45 infants (15.7%) experienced severe neurocognitive delay. MIP was not associated with differences in cord blood cytokine levels or neurocognitive development. Preterm birth, low birthweight, increasing maternal education level, and increasing interleukin 6 levels were associated significantly with delay. The results highlight the prevalence of severe delay and a need for broad access to early childhood support in this setting.","1766":"We used a previously validated transmission model to project lifetime health benefits, costs, effectiveness, and timeline for cervical cancer elimination of alternative scenarios, including combining HPV vaccination initiated from 2022 to 2030 with screening in different modalities and coverage increase rates, as well as screening alone. All women living or projected to be born in China during 2022-2100 were considered. We employed a societal perspective.Current uptake of HPV vaccination and screening in China is far below World Health Organization 2030 targets for cervical cancer elimination. We quantified health and economic losses of delaying large-scale HPV vaccination and screening implementation in China.Regardless of vaccine type, immediate large-scale vaccination initiated in 2022 and achieving 70% coverage of HPV-based screening in 2030 (no-delay scenario) would be the least costly and most effective. Compared with the no-delay scenario, delaying vaccination by eight years would result in 434,000-543,000 additional cervical cancer cases, 138,000-178,000 deaths, and $2863-4437 million costs, and delay elimination by 9-10 years. Even with immediate vaccination, the gradual scale-up of LBC-based screening to 70% coverage in 2070 would result in 2,530,000-3,060,000 additional cases, 909,000-1,040,000 deaths, and $5098-5714 million costs compared with no-delay scenario, and could not achieve elimination if domestic 2vHPV or 4vHPV vaccines are used (4.09-4.21 cases per 100,000 woman in 2100).Delaying large-scale HPV vaccination and\/or high-performance screening implementation has detrimental consequences for cervical cancer morbidity, mortality, and expenditure. These findings should spur health authorities to expedite large-scale vaccine rollout and improve screening.Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (INV-031449 and INV-003174) and CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences (CIFMS) (2021-I2M-1-004).","1767":"Not applicable.COVID-19 plagued the globe, with non-pharmaceutical interventions and multiple SARS-CoV-2 clusters hinting on its evolving epidemiology. Since the disease course is governed by important epidemiological parameters, including containment delays (CDs) (i.e. time between symptom onset and mandatory isolation) and serial intervals (SIs) (i.e. time between symptom onsets of infector-infectee pairs), understanding their temporal changes helps to guide interventions.First, the factors associated with reduced CDs suggested government-enacted interventions (such as public mode of case detection) were useful to achieve outbreak control and should be further encouraged. Second, shorter SIs associated with the composite mobility index called for empirical surveys that disentangle the role of different contact dimensions in disease transmission. Third, the pre-symptomatic transmission and asymptomatic cases reminded the importance of remaining vigilant about COVID-19. Fourth, the time-varying epidemiological parameters suggest the need to incorporate their temporal variations when depicting the epidemic trajectory. Fifth, the high proportion of transmission events within the same age groups supported the ban on gatherings outside of households, and that in household pushed forward the need for residence-center preventive measures.We retrieved the official case series and the Apple mobility data of Hong Kong in January-August 2020. The empirical CDs and SIs were fitted to theoretical distributions, and factors associated with their temporal changes were quantified in terms of percentage contribution (PC), which was the percentage change in the predicted outcome (from multivariable regression models) relative to a predefined comparator. Rt was estimated with the best fitted distribution for SIs.To characterize the epidemiology of the first two epidemic waves of COVID-19 in Hong Kong by (i) estimating the CDs, SIs, effective reproductive number (Rt), and the proportion of asymptomatic cases; (ii) identifying factors associated with the temporal changes of the CDs and SIs; and (iii) depicting the COVID-19 transmission by age assortativity and types of social settings.The two epidemic waves were featured by imported cases and clusters of local cases respectively. Rt rose to peak at 2.39 (wave 1) and 3.04 (wave 2). The proportion of asymptomatic cases decreased from 36.4% (0-9 years) to 12.9% (\u226580 years). Log-normal distribution best fitted the 1574 CDs (mean:5.18 days; standard deviation [SD]:3.04) and the 558 SIs (17 negative) (mean:4.74 days; SD:4.24). CDs decreased with involvement in a cluster (PC:10.08-20.73%) and case detection in the public healthcare sector (PC:27.56%; 95% confidence interval [CI]:22.52, 32.33). SIs decreased over time (6.70 days [wave 1] versus 4.35 days [wave 2]) and with the tertiary transmission or beyond (PC: -17.31% to -50.75%), but was lengthened by mobility (PC: 0.83%). Transmission within the same age band was high (18.1%); and households (69.9%), followed by social settings (20.3%), were two most common settings at which the transmission happened.","1768":"Recent outbreaks of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) infections, and their causal linkage with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), continue to pose a serious public health concern. During 2020 and 2021, the dynamics of EV-D68 and other pathogens have been significantly perturbed by non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19; this perturbation presents a powerful natural experiment for exploring the dynamics of these endemic infections. In this study, we analyzed publicly available data on EV-D68 infections, originally collected through the New Vaccine Surveillance Network, to predict their short- and long-term dynamics following the COVID-19 interventions. Although long-term predictions are sensitive to our assumptions about underlying dynamics and changes in contact rates during the NPI periods, the likelihood of a large outbreak in 2023 appears to be low. Comprehensive surveillance data are needed to accurately characterize future dynamics of EV-D68. The limited incidence of AFM cases in 2022, despite large EV-D68 outbreaks, poses further questions for the timing of the next AFM outbreaks.","1769":"The number of network science applications across many different fields has been rapidly increasing. Surprisingly, the development of theory and domain-specific applications often occur in isolation, risking an effective disconnect between theoretical and methodological advances and the way network science is employed in practice. Here we address this risk constructively, discussing good practices to guarantee more successful applications and reproducible results. We endorse designing statistically grounded methodologies to address challenges in network science. This approach allows one to explain observational data in terms of generative models, naturally deal with intrinsic uncertainties, and strengthen the link between theory and applications.","1770":"We used Illinois Department of Public Health's COVID-19 confirmed case and vaccination data and investigated scenarios where masking and vaccination would have been reduced to mimic what would have happened had the mask mandate or vaccine\u00a0requirement not been put in place. The study examined a range of potential reductions in masking and vaccination mimicking potential scenarios had the mask mandate or vaccine\u00a0requirement not been enacted. We estimated COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations averted by changes in masking and vaccination during the period covering October 20 to December 20, 2021.We find that the announcement and implementation of a mask mandate are likely to correlate with a strong protective effect at reducing COVID-19 burden and the announcement of a vaccinate-or-test requirement among frontline professionals is likely to correlate with a more modest protective effect at reducing COVID-19 burden. In our most conservative scenario, we estimated that from the period of\u00a0October\u00a020 to December 20, 2021, the mask mandate likely prevented approximately 58,000 cases and 1,175 hospitalizations, while the vaccinate-or-test requirement may have prevented at most approximately 24,000 cases and 475 hospitalizations.Our results indicate that mask mandates and vaccine-or-test requirements are vital in mitigating the burden of COVID-19 during surges of the virus.Facing a surge of COVID-19 cases in late August 2021, the U.S. state of Illinois re-enacted its COVID-19 mask mandate for the general public and issued a requirement for workers in certain professions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or undergo weekly testing. The mask mandate required any individual, regardless of their vaccination status, to wear a well-fitting mask in an indoor setting.","1771":"Influenza virus infections are believed to spread mostly by close contact in the community. Social distancing measures are essential components of the public health response to influenza pandemics. The objective of these mitigation measures is to reduce transmission, thereby delaying the epidemic peak, reducing the size of the epidemic peak, and spreading cases over a longer time to relieve pressure on the healthcare system. We conducted systematic reviews of the evidence base for effectiveness of multiple mitigation measures: isolating ill persons, contact tracing, quarantining exposed persons, school closures, workplace measures\/closures, and avoiding crowding. Evidence supporting the effectiveness of these measures was obtained largely from observational studies and simulation studies. Voluntary isolation at home might be a more feasible social distancing measure, and pandemic plans should consider how to facilitate this measure. More drastic social distancing measures might be reserved for severe pandemics.","1772":"Investigations into which human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) sequence features may be selected for transmission during sexual exposure have been hampered by the small number of characterized transmission pairs in individual studies.By using all available well-characterized env sequences from transmission pairs via sexual exposure, we were able to identify several important virologic factors that may be important in the development of biomedical preventive interventions.To boost statistical power to detect differences in glycosylation, length, and electrical charge in the HIV-1 V1-V4 coding region, we reanalyzed all available 2485 env sequences derived from 114 subjects representing 58 transmission pairs from previous studies using mixed-effects linear regression and an approach to approximate the unobserved transmitted virus.The recipient partner had a shorter V1-V4 region and fewer potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS) than sequences from the source partner. We also detected a trend toward more PNGS and lower isoelectric points in transmitted sequences with source partner and the evolutionary tendency to shorten V1-V4 sequences, reduce the number of PNGS, and lower isoelectric points in the recipient following transmission.","1773":"The COVID-19 outbreak has highlighted our vulnerability to novel infections. Faced with this threat and no effective treatment, in line with many other countries, the UK adopted enforced social distancing (lockdown) to reduce transmission-successfully reducing the reproductive number R below one. However, given the large pool of susceptible individuals that remain, complete relaxation of controls is likely to generate a substantial further outbreak. Vaccination remains the only foreseeable means of both containing the infection and returning to normal interactions and behaviour. Here, we consider the optimal targeting of vaccination within the UK, with the aim of minimising future deaths or quality adjusted life year (QALY) losses. We show that, for a range of assumptions on the action and efficacy of the vaccine, targeting older age groups first is optimal and may be sufficient to stem the epidemic if the vaccine prevents transmission as well as disease.","1774":"Domestic and captive animals and cultivated plants should be recognised as integral components in contemporary ecosystems. They interact with wild organisms through such mechanisms as hybridization, predation, herbivory, competition and disease transmission and, in many cases, define ecosystem properties. Nevertheless, it is widespread practice for data on domestic, captive and cultivated organisms to be excluded from biodiversity repositories, such as natural history collections. Furthermore, there is a lack of integration of data collected about biodiversity in disciplines, such as agriculture, veterinary science, epidemiology and invasion science. Discipline-specific data are often intentionally excluded from integrative databases in order to maintain the \"purity\" of data on natural processes. Rather than being beneficial, we argue that this practise of data exclusivity greatly limits the utility of discipline-specific data for applications ranging from agricultural pest management to invasion biology, infectious disease prevention and community ecology. This problem can be resolved by data providers using standards to indicate whether the observed organism is of wild or domestic origin and by integrating their data with other biodiversity data (e.g. in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility). Doing so will enable efforts to integrate the full panorama of biodiversity knowledge across related disciplines to tackle pressing societal questions.","1775":"Annual estimates of the influenza disease burden provide information to evaluate programs and allocate resources. We used a multiplier method with routine population-based surveillance data on influenza hospitalization in the United States to correct for under-reporting and estimate the burden of influenza for seasons after the 2009 pandemic. Five sites of the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) collected data on the frequency and sensitivity of influenza testing during two seasons to estimate under-detection. Population-based rates of influenza-associated hospitalization and Intensive Care Unit admission from 2010-2013 were extrapolated to the U.S. population from FluSurv-NET and corrected for under-detection. Influenza deaths were calculated using a ratio of deaths to hospitalizations. We estimated that influenza-related hospitalizations were under-detected during 2010-11 by a factor of 2.1 (95%CI 1.7-2.9) for age < 18 years, 3.1 (2.4-4.5) for ages 18-64 years, and 5.2 (95%CI 3.8-8.3) for age 65+. Results were similar in 2011-12. Extrapolated estimates for 3 seasons from 2010-2013 included: 114,192-624,435 hospitalizations, 18,491-95,390 ICU admissions, and 4,915-27,174 deaths per year; 54-70% of hospitalizations and 71-85% of deaths occurred among adults aged 65+. Influenza causes a substantial disease burden in the U.S. that varies by age and season. Periodic estimation of multipliers across multiple sites and age groups improves our understanding of influenza detection in sentinel surveillance systems. Adjusting surveillance data using a multiplier method is a relatively simple means to estimate the impact of influenza and the subsequent value of interventions to prevent influenza.

One of the effects of the presence of high titers of passively acquired maternal antibodies in young infants is blunting of immune responses to infant vaccination. We present infant immune responses to a fourth pertussis containing vaccine dose at 15 months of age, as a follow-up of previously presented data. In a prospective cohort study, women were either vaccinated with an acellular pertussis vaccine (Boostrix(\u00ae)) during pregnancy (vaccine group) or received no vaccine (control group). All infants were vaccinated with Infanrix Hexa(\u00ae) according to the standard Belgian vaccination schedule (8\/12\/16 weeks, 15 months). We report results from blood samples collected before and 1 month after the fourth vaccine dose. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), pertactin (Prn), tetanus toxoid (TT) and diphtheria toxoid (DT) were measured using commercially available ELISA tests. Antibody levels were expressed in International Units per milliliter. Demographic characteristics were similar in the vaccine and control group. Before the fourth vaccine dose, significantly lower antibody titers were measured in the vaccine group compared to the control group for anti-Prn IgG (p=0.003) and anti-DT IgG (p=0.023), with a steep decay of antibody titers since post-primary vaccination. One month after the fourth dose, antibody titers were only significantly lower in the vaccine group for anti-PT IgG (p=0.006). For all antigens, there was a rise in antibody titer after the fourth vaccine dose. The present results indicate still a minor blunting effect 1 month after a fourth vaccine dose for anti-PT antibodies. However, a good humoral immune response on all measured antigens was elicited in both groups of children. The clinical significance of such blunting effect is yet unknown.

Whether naturally, accidentally or maliciously introduced, the substantial uncertainty surrounding the emergence of novel viruses, specifically where they may come from and how they will spread, demands robust and quantifiably validated outbreak control policies that can be implemented in real time. This work presents a novel mathematical modeling framework that integrates both outbreak dynamics and outbreak control into a decision support tool for mitigating infectious disease pandemics that spread through passenger air travel. An ensemble of border control strategies that exploit properties of the air traffic network structure and expected outbreak behavior are proposed. A stochastic metapopulation epidemic model is developed to evaluate and rank the control strategies based on their effectiveness in reducing the spread of outbreaks. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to illustrate the robustness of the proposed control strategies across a range of outbreak scenarios, and a case study is presented for the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. This study highlights the importance of strategically allocating outbreak control resources, and the results can be used to identify the most robust border control policy that can be implemented in the early stages of an outbreak.","1779":"Temperature responses of many biological traits-including population growth, survival, and development-are described by thermal performance curves (TPCs) with phenomenological models like the Briere function or mechanistic models related to chemical kinetics. Existing TPC models are either simple but inflexible in shape, or flexible yet difficult to interpret in biological terms. Here we present flexTPC: a model that is parameterized exclusively in terms of biologically interpretable quantities, including the thermal minimum, optimum, and maximum, and the maximum trait value. FlexTPC can describe unimodal temperature responses of any skewness and thermal breadth, enabling direct comparisons across populations, traits, or taxa with a single model. We apply flexTPC to various microbial and entomological datasets, compare results with the Briere model, and find that flexTPC often has better predictive performance. The interpretability of flexTPC makes it ideal for modeling how thermal responses change with ecological stressors or evolve over time.","1780":"Turkey hosts almost 3.5M refugees and has to face a humanitarian emergency of unprecedented levels. We use mobile phone data to map the mobility patterns of both Turkish and Syrian refugees, and use these patterns to build data-driven computational models for quantifying the risk of epidemics spreading for measles -- a disease having a satisfactory immunization coverage in Turkey but not in Syria, due to the recent civil war -- while accounting for hypothetical policies to integrate the refugees with the Turkish population. Our results provide quantitative evidence that policies to enhance social integration between refugees and the hosting population would reduce the transmission potential of measles by almost 50%, preventing the onset of widespread large epidemics in the country. Our results suggest that social segregation does not hamper but rather boosts potential outbreaks of measles to a greater extent in Syrian refugees but also in Turkish citizens, although to a lesser extent. This is due to the fact that the high immunization coverage of Turkish citizens can shield Syrian refugees from getting exposed to the infection and this in turn reduces potential sources of infection and spillover of cases among Turkish citizens as well, in a virtuous cycle reminiscent of herd immunity.","1781":" strains and features.","1782":"Mosquitoes vector harmful pathogens that infect millions of people every year, and developing approaches to effectively control mosquitoes is a topic of great interest. However, the success of many control measures is highly dependent upon ecological, physiological, and life history traits of mosquito species. The behavior of mosquitoes and their potential to vector pathogens can also be impacted by these traits. One trait of interest is mosquito body mass, which depends upon many factors associated with the environment in which juvenile mosquitoes develop. Our experiments examined the impact of larval density on the body mass of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which are important vectors of dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and other pathogens. To investigate the interactions between the larval environment and mosquito body mass, we built a discrete time mathematical model that incorporates body mass, larval density, and food availability and fit the model to our experimental data. We considered three categories of model complexity informed by data, and selected the best model within each category using Akaike's Information Criterion. We found that the larval environment is an important determinant of the body mass of mosquitoes upon emergence. Furthermore, we found that larval density has greater impact on body mass of adults at emergence than on development time, and that inclusion of density dependence in the survival of female aquatic stages in models is important. We discuss the implications of our results for the control of Aedes mosquitoes and on their potential to spread disease.","1783":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology has been increasingly used in neuroscience studies. Reproducibility\u00a0of statistically significant findings generated by MRI-based studies, especially association studies (phenotype vs. MRI metric) and task-induced brain activation, has been recently heavily debated. However, most currently available reproducibility measures depend on thresholds for the test statistics and cannot be use to evaluate overall study reproducibility. It is also crucial to elucidate the relationship between overall study reproducibility and sample size in an experimental design. In this study, we proposed a model-based reproducibility index to quantify reproducibility which could be used in large-scale high-throughput MRI-based studies including both association studies and task-induced brain activation. We performed the model-based reproducibility assessments for a few association studies and task-induced brain activation by using several recent large sMRI\/fMRI\u00a0databases. For large sample size association studies between brain structure\/function features and some basic physiological phenotypes (i.e. Sex, BMI), we demonstrated that the model-based reproducibility of these studies is more than 0.99. For MID task activation, similar results could be observed. Furthermore, we proposed a model-based analytical tool to evaluate minimal sample size for the purpose of achieving a desirable model-based reproducibility. Additionally, we evaluated the model-based reproducibility of gray matter volume (GMV) changes for UK Biobank (UKB) vs. Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) and UK Biobank (UKB) vs. Human Connectome Project (HCP). We demonstrated that both sample size and study-specific experimental factors play important roles in the model-based reproducibility assessments for different experiments. In summary, a systematic assessment of reproducibility is fundamental and important in the current large-scale high-throughput MRI-based studies.","1784":"Worldwide increases in early-onset colon, rectal, pancreatic, and kidney cancers may have been partly driven by increases in excess body weight. The increases in other early-onset cancers, however, were likely driven by other factors deserving of further investigation.Incidence of early-onset cancers at multiple organ sites has increased worldwide in recent decades. We investigated whether such increasing trends could be explained by trends in obesity.We found increased incidence for six of nine obesity-related and seven of twelve non-obesity-related cancers in 25-49-year-olds. These increases were more predominant in Western countries (particularly Australia, the USA, Canada, Norway, the Netherlands, and Lithuania). For four obesity-related cancers displaying increased incidence (colon, rectum, pancreas, kidney), changes in cancer incidence were positively correlated with changes in overweight and obesity prevalence. When accounting for a 15-year lag, the estimated correlation was 0.27 (95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u2009-0.04, 0.53; P\u2009=\u20090.090) for colon cancer, 0.33 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.02, 0.58; P\u2009=\u20090.036) for rectal cancer, 0.39 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.08, 0.64; P\u2009=\u20090.018) for pancreatic cancer, and 0.22 (95% CI\u2009=\u2009-0.10, 0.50; P\u2009=\u20090.173) for kidney cancer. Similar correlations were found in the sensitivity and supplemental analyses. We did not find similar correlations with excess body weight for the non-obesity-related early-onset cancers, nor correlations with per-capita gross national income for any cancer types, in the negative control analyses.We obtained incidence data for 21 common cancers among 25-49-year-olds during 2000-2012 in 42 countries from the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents database. Nine cancers we examined have been classified as obesity-related by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Estimates of overweight and obesity prevalence came from the Non-communicable Disease Risk Factor Collaboration. Using country-level data, we examined whether changes in the prevalence of overweight and obesity combined were correlated with changes in cancer incidence, after accounting for various time lags (0-15 years) between exposure and cancer diagnosis. To test the validity of our approach, we conducted negative control analyses (using non-obesity-related cancers as the outcome variable, and per-capita gross national income as the exposure variable), and sensitivity and supplemental analyses using alternative data streams or processing.","1785":"The characteristics of influenza seasons vary substantially from year to year, posing challenges for public health preparation and response. Influenza forecasting is used to inform seasonal outbreak response, which can in turn potentially reduce the impact of an epidemic. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in collaboration with external researchers, has run an annual prospective influenza forecasting exercise, known as the FluSight challenge. Uniting theoretical results from the forecasting literature with domain-specific forecasts from influenza outbreaks, we applied parametric forecast combination methods that simultaneously optimize model weights and calibrate the ensemble via a beta transformation and made adjustments to the methods to reduce their complexity. We used the beta-transformed linear pool, the finite beta mixture model, and their equal weight adaptations to produce ensemble forecasts retrospectively for the 2016\/2017, 2017\/2018, and 2018\/2019 influenza seasons in the U.S. We compared their performance to methods that were used in the FluSight challenge to produce the FluSight Network ensemble, namely the equally weighted linear pool and the linear pool. Ensemble forecasts produced from methods with a beta transformation were shown to outperform those from the equally weighted linear pool and the linear pool for all week-ahead targets across in the test seasons based on average log scores. We observed improvements in overall accuracy despite the beta-transformed linear pool or beta mixture methods' modest under-prediction across all targets and seasons. Combination techniques that explicitly adjust for known calibration issues in linear pooling should be considered to improve probabilistic scores in outbreak settings.","1786":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of pathogen spillover from wildlife to human hosts, particularly in densely populated urban centers. Prevention of future zoonotic disease is contingent on informed surveillance for known and novel threats across diverse human-wildlife interfaces. Cities are a key venue for potential spillover events because of the presence of zoonotic pathogens transmitted by hosts and vectors living in close proximity to dense human settlements. Effectively identifying and managing zoonotic hazards requires understanding the socio-ecological processes driving hazard distribution and pathogen prevalence in dynamic and heterogeneous urban landscapes. Despite increasing awareness of the human health impacts of zoonotic hazards, the integration of an eco-epidemiological perspective into public health management plans remains limited. Here we discuss how landscape patterns, abiotic conditions, and biotic interactions influence zoonotic hazards across highly urbanized cities (HUCs) in temperate climates in order to promote their efficient and effective management by a multi-sectoral coalition of public health stakeholders. We describe how to interpret both direct and indirect ecological processes, incorporate spatial scale, and evaluate networks of connectivity specific to different zoonotic hazards to promote biologically informed and targeted decision-making. Using New York City, USA as a case study, we identify major zoonotic threats, apply knowledge of relevant ecological factors, and highlight opportunities and challenges for research and intervention. We aim to broaden the toolbox of urban public health stakeholders by providing ecologically-informed, practical guidance for the evaluation and management of zoonotic hazards.","1787":"Modelling results suggest that in a scenario without inpatient testing, infection prevention and control measures, and reductions in occupancy and visitors, the number of patients developing a nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection could have been twice as high over the course of the pandemic, and over 600,000 HCWs could have been infected in the first wave alone. Isolation of symptomatic HCWs and universal masking by HCWs were the most effective interventions for preventing infections in both patient and HCW populations. Model findings suggest that collectively the interventions introduced over the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in England averted 400,000 (240,000 - 500,000) infections in inpatients and 410,000 (370,000 - 450,000) HCW infections.Interventions to reduce the spread of nosocomial infections have varying impact, but the package of interventions implemented in England significantly reduced nosocomial transmission to both patients and HCWs over the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.Prior to September 2021, 55,000-90,000 hospital inpatients in England were identified as having a potentially nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection. This includes cases that were likely missed due to pauci- or asymptomatic infection. Further, high numbers of healthcare workers (HCWs) are thought to have been infected, and there is evidence that some of these cases may also have been nosocomially linked, with both HCW to HCW and patient to HCW transmission being reported. From the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic interventions in hospitals such as testing patients on admission and universal mask wearing were introduced to stop spread within and between patient and HCW populations, the effectiveness of which are largely unknown.Using an individual-based model of within-hospital transmission, we estimated the contribution of individual interventions (together and in combination) to the effectiveness of the overall package of interventions implemented in English hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. A panel of experts in infection prevention and control informed intervention choice and helped ensure the model reflected implementation in practice. Model parameters and associated uncertainty were derived using national and local data, literature review and formal elicitation of expert opinion. We simulated scenarios to explore how many nosocomial infections might have been seen in patients and HCWs if interventions had not been implemented. We simulated the time period from March-2020 to July-2022 encompassing different strains and multiple doses of vaccination.","1788":"The Yangtze river delta in eastern China, centered on Shanghai, is one of the most populated regions of the world with more than 100\u00a0million residents. We examined the impact of influenza on excess mortality in Yancheng, a prefecture-level city with 8.2\u00a0million population located 250\u00a0km north of Shanghai, during 2011-2015.We obtained individual data on deaths by date, age, sex, and cause in Yancheng from the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and used these to derive weekly rates of mortality from respiratory causes, respiratory and cardiovascular causes combined, and all causes. We used data on influenza-like illnesses and laboratory detections of influenza to construct a proxy measure of the weekly incidence of influenza virus infections in the community. We used regression models to estimate the association of influenza activity with mortality and excess mortality by age, cause, and influenza type\/subtype.We estimated that an annual average of 4.59 (95% confidence interval: 3.94, 7.41) excess respiratory deaths per 100\u00a0000 persons were associated with influenza, which was 4.6% of all respiratory deaths in the years studied. Almost all influenza-associated excess deaths occurred in persons \u226565\u00a0years. Influenza A(H3N2) had the greatest impact on mortality and was associated with around 50% of the influenza-associated respiratory deaths in the 5\u00a0years studied.Influenza has a substantial impact on respiratory mortality in Yancheng, mainly in older adults. Influenza vaccination has the potential to reduce disease burden, and cost-effectiveness analysis could be used to compare policy options.","1789":"A cross-sectional study was carried out. A 27-item prepilot tested close-ended questionnaire was designed and administered online to collect data on knowledge of asepsis, sterilization, instrument handling, disinfection, hand-hygiene practices, dental practice, age, education, and experience level from March 2020 to June 2020.Out of 70 dental assistants, the majority were aged between 21 and 29 years (44.30%), more than two-thirds (85.41%) of the dental assistants were working in a hospital, while 14.29% were working in private clinics, only 7.1% had a diploma in the dental assistant program, and 74% had more than 2 years of experience in practice. Dental assistants working in private practice (76.30) had a higher mean knowledge scores compared to those working in hospital (74.25), while those with less than 2 years of experience (75.61) had a higher scores compared to those with 2-5 years of experience (73.96).Better compliance with recommended infection control and waste management practices is needed for all dental assistants. Continuing education programs targeting such awareness are vital to improve the management of hazardous waste practices among dental assistants.","1790":"Five years of sustained indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticide from 2014 to 2019, first using a carbamate followed by an organophosphate, was associated with a marked reduction in the incidence of malaria in five districts of Uganda. We assessed changes in malaria incidence over an additional 21 months, corresponding to a change in IRS formulations using clothianidin with and without deltamethrin. Using enhanced health facility surveillance data, our objectives were to 1) estimate the impact of IRS on monthly malaria case counts at five surveillance sites over a 6.75 year period, and 2) compare monthly case counts at five facilities receiving IRS to ten facilities in neighboring districts not receiving IRS. For both objectives, we specified mixed effects negative binomial regression models with random intercepts for surveillance site adjusting for rainfall, season, care-seeking, and malaria diagnostic. Following the implementation of IRS, cases were 84% lower in years 4-5 (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] = 0.16, 95% CI 0.12-0.22), 43% lower in year 6 (aIRR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.44-0.74), and 39% higher in the first 9 months of year 7 (aIRR = 1.39, 95% CI 0.97-1.97) compared to pre-IRS levels. Cases were 67% lower in IRS sites than non-IRS sites in year 6 (aIRR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.17-0.63) but 38% higher in the first 9 months of year 7 (aIRR = 1.38, 95% CI 0.90-2.11). We observed a resurgence in malaria to pre-IRS levels despite sustained IRS. The timing of this resurgence corresponded to a change of active ingredient. Further research is needed to determine causality.","1791":"In this study, we addressed the ability of a minimalistic SEIR model to satisfactorily describe influenza outbreak dynamics in Russian settings. For that purpose, we calibrated an age-specific influenza dynamics model to Russian acute respiratory infection (ARI) incidence data over 2009-2016 and assessed the variability of proportion of non-immune individuals in the population depending on the regarded city, the non-epidemic indicence baseline, the contact structure considered and the used calibration method. The experiments demonstrated the importance of distinguishing characteristics of different age groups, such as contact intensities and background immunity levels. It was also found that the current model calibration process, which relies mostly on ARI incidence, demonstrates notable variation of output parameter values. Employing additional sources of data, such as strain-specific influenza incidence and external assessments on underreporting levels in different age groups, might enhance the plausibility of parameter values obtained by model calibration, along with reducing the assessment variation.","1792":"Our results indicate that AFB smear grade is independently associated with tuberculosis recurrence after successful treatment for an initial episode while the association between polyclonal M. tuberculosis infection and increased risk of recurrence appears possible.We enrolled 500 patients with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis in South Africa and collected baseline data on demographics, clinical presentation and sputum mycobacterial cultures for 24-loci mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing. We used routinely-collected administrative data to identify recurrent episodes of tuberculosis occurring over a median of six years after successful treatment completion.Of 500 patients initially enrolled, 333 (79%) successfully completed treatment for tuberculosis. During the follow-up period 35 patients with successful treatment (11%) experienced a bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis recurrence. In our Cox proportional hazards model, a 3+ AFB sputum smear grade was significantly associated with recurrent tuberculosis with a hazard ratio of 3.33 (95% CI 1.44-7.7). The presence of polyclonal M. tuberculosis infection at baseline had a hazard ratio for recurrence of 1.96 (95% CI 0.86-4.48).People successfully completing treatment for tuberculosis remain at elevated risk for recurrent disease, either from relapse or reinfection. Identifying risk factors for recurrent tuberculosis may help target post-tuberculosis screening and care.","1793":"Early public health strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the United States relied on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as vaccines and therapeutic treatments were not yet available. Implementation of NPIs, primarily social distancing and mask wearing, varied widely between communities within the US due to variable government mandates, as well as differences in attitudes and opinions. To understand the interplay of trust, risk perception, behavioral intention, and disease burden, we developed a survey instrument to study attitudes concerning COVID-19 and pandemic behavioral change in three states: Idaho, Texas, and Vermont. We designed our survey (n = 1034) to detect whether these relationships were significantly different in rural populations. The best fitting structural equation models show that trust indirectly affects protective pandemic behaviors via health and economic risk perception. We explore two different variations of this social cognitive model: the first assumes behavioral intention affects future disease burden while the second assumes that observed disease burden affects behavioral intention. In our models we include several exogenous variables to control for demographic and geographic effects. Notably, political ideology is the only exogenous variable which significantly affects all aspects of the social cognitive model (trust, risk perception, and behavioral intention). While there is a direct negative effect associated with rurality on disease burden, likely due to the protective effect of low population density in the early pandemic waves, we found a marginally significant, positive, indirect effect of rurality on disease burden via decreased trust (p = 0.095). This trust deficit creates additional vulnerabilities to COVID-19 in rural communities which also have reduced healthcare capacity. Increasing trust by methods such as in-group messaging could potentially remove some of the disparities inferred by our models and increase NPI effectiveness."},"journal":{"0":"Journal of technology in behavioral science","1":"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","2":"Nature communications","3":"medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences","4":"Antimicrobial resistance and infection control","5":"Current opinion in virology","6":"Vaccine","7":"Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin","8":"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","9":"Chest","10":"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","11":"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)","12":"BMC medical research methodology","13":"Rheumatology (Oxford, England)","14":"The Journal of rural health : official journal of the American Rural Health Association and the National Rural Health Care Association","15":"BMJ open","16":"PLoS computational biology","17":"Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology","18":"The Lancet.
