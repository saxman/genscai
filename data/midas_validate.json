Host immunity is therefore one of the fastest evolving traits. But where do the novel immune traits come from? Here, we test for phylogenetic conservation in a rapidly evolving immune trait - peritoneal fibrosis. Peritoneal fibrosis is a costly defense against a specialist tapeworm, Schistocephalus solidus (Cestoda), expressed in some freshwater populations of threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus, Perciformes). We asked whether stickleback fibrosis is a derived species-specific trait or an ancestral immune response that was widely distributed across ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii) only to be employed by threespine stickleback against the specialist parasite. We combined literature review on peritoneal fibrosis with a comparative experiment using either parasite-specific, or non-specific, immune challenge in deliberately selected species across fish tree of life. We show that ray-finned fish are broadly, but not universally, able to induce peritoneal fibrosis when challenged with a generic stimulus (Alum adjuvant). The experimental species were, however, largely indifferent to the tapeworm antigen homogenate. Peritoneal fibrosis, thus, appears to be a common and deeply conserved fish immune response that was co-opted by stickleback to adapt to a new selective challenge.

When ranking individuals based on risk score, the prediction model more accurately identified fatal overdose at 6 months compared to using opioid dosage or opioid\/benzodiazepine overlap, although the percentage of individuals in the highest risk percentile who died at 6 months was less than 1%.The training\/testing (n\u00a0=\u00a03020,748) and validation (n\u00a0=\u00a02237,701) cohorts included Pennsylvania residents with a prescription dispensing from February 2018-September 2021. Potential predictors (n\u00a0=\u00a0222) were measured in the 6 months prior to a random index date. Using a gradient boosting machine, we developed a 20-variable model to predict risk of fatal drug overdose in the 6 months after the index date.","2":"2019\u5e7412\u6708\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u6e56\u5317\u7701\u6b66\u6c49\u5e02\u66b4\u53d1\u65b0\u578b\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u80ba\u708e\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u75ab\u60c5\u5f88\u5feb\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u5f62\u52bf\u4e25\u5cfb\u3002\u968f\u7740\u75ab\u60c5\u9ad8\u5cf0\u53ca\u66f4\u591a\u5730\u533a\u5f00\u5c55\u75c5\u539f\u5b66\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u513f\u7ae5\u611f\u67d3\u62a5\u544a\u75c5\u4f8b\u6570\u6b63\u5728\u660e\u663e\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u5907\u53d7\u5404\u65b9\u5173\u6ce8\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u91cd\u89c6\u3002\u4e2d\u534e\u533b\u5b66\u4f1a\u513f\u79d1\u5b66\u5206\u4f1a\u548c\u4e2d\u534e\u513f\u79d1\u6742\u5fd7\u7f16\u8f91\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u76f8\u5173\u4e13\u4e1a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5728\u603b\u7ed3\u90e8\u5206\u513f\u7ae5\u75c5\u4f8b\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u75be\u75c5\u7279\u70b9\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5c31\u513f\u7ae5\u75c5\u4f8b\u8bca\u65ad\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u5904\u7f6e\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u6cbb\u7597\u548c\u9632\u63a7\u7b49\u63d0\u51fa\u5efa\u8bae\u3002.","3":"Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, while the t-test was used for continuous variables. The association between clinical decision-making and adverse health outcomes amongst patients with IE were examined via generalised linear mixed models.Sex, age, place of birth, and clinical decision-making were important predictors of severe disease and death in hospital, lending weight that health care clinical decisions may adversely impact health outcomes for populations of interest.This study aimed to investigate the demographic differences amongst patients diagnosed with infective endocarditis (IE), predictors of adverse events, and the association between clinical decision-making and adverse health outcomes amongst patients with IE.All patients (N=18,044) from 2001 to 2020 in New South Wales who received a diagnosis of IE using ICD-10-AM diagnostic code 133.0 were included.A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted using the New South Wales (NSW) Admitted Patient Data Collection (APDC) from the Centre for Health Record Linkage (CHeReL).Sex, age, birthplace and referral impacted clinical decision-making, in-hospital death and severity of the disease. Women experienced a higher risk of death and fewer escalations of care. Admission and mortality increased with age, with those aged 60 years and above responsible for 60.8% of hospitalisations. Despite octogenarians making up one-fifth of admissions and having the worst mortality rate (15.1%), they experienced only one in 10 intensive care (ICU) admissions. Overseas-born patients had fewer escalations of care and experienced less severe disease if referred by a medical practitioner. One out of 10 admissions that resulted in a hospital death were given non-emergency status, and one in two ICU patients died in hospital.","4":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a dreadful novel coronavirus with global health concerns among pregnant women. To date, the vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy remains controversial. We briefly report recent findings of placental response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and updates on vertical transmission. We systematically searched PubMed and Google Scholar databases according to PRISMA guidelines for studies reporting the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the placenta and possibility of vertical transmission. We identified 45 studies reporting 1,280 human placentas that were analyzed by molecular pathology methods and 11,112 placenta-derived cells from a publicly available database that was analyzed using bioinformatics tools. The main finding of this study is that the SARS-CoV-2 canonical entry receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) are abundantly expressed on the placenta during the first trimester, and this expression diminishes across gestational age. Out of 45 eligible studies identified, 24 (53.34%) showed no evidence of vertical transmission, 15 (33.33%) supported the hypothesis of very rare, low possibility of vertical transmission and 6 (13.33%) were indecisive and had no comment on vertical transmission. Furthermore, 433 placentas from 12 studies were also identified for placental pathology investigation. There was evidence of at least one form of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM), 57\/433 (13.1%), fetal vascular malperfusion (FVM), 81\/433 (18.7%) and placental inflammation with excessive infiltration of CD3+ CD8+ lymphocytes, CD68+ macrophages and CD20+ lymphocytes in most of the eligible studies. Decidual vasculopathy (3.2%), infarction (3.2%), chronic histiocytic intervillositis (6.0%), thrombi vasculopathy (5.1%) were also observed in most of the MVM and FVM reported cases. The results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 induces placenta inflammation, and placenta susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 decreases across the pregnancy window. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection in early pregnancy may adversely affect the developing fetus.","5":"We recruited 800 pregnant women in each study country (Guatemala, India, Peru, and Rwanda) who used biomass fuels in their households. Households were randomly assigned to receive LPG stoves and 18\u2005months of free LPG supply (intervention) or to continue using biomass fuels (control). Households were followed for 18\u2005months and assessed for primary health outcomes: low birth weight, severe pneumonia, and stunting. The HAPIN Data Management Core (DMC) implemented identical REDCap projects for each study site using shared variable names and timelines in local languages. Field staff collected data offline using tablets on the REDCap Mobile Application.While the HAPIN trial experienced some challenges, REDCap effectively met HAPIN study goals, including quality data collection and timely reporting and analysis on this important global health trial, and supported more than 40 peer-reviewed scientific publications to date.Household air pollution (HAP) is a leading environmental risk factor accounting for about 1.6\u2005million premature deaths mainly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, no multicounty randomized controlled trials have assessed the effect of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stove intervention on HAP and maternal and child health outcomes. The Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) was the first to assess this by implementing a common protocol in four LMICs.Utilizing the REDCap application allowed the HAPIN DMC to collect and store data securely, access data (near real-time), create reports, perform quality control, update questionnaires, and provide timely feedback to local data management teams. Additional REDCap functionalities (e.g. scheduling, data validation, and barcode scanning) supported the study.This manuscript describes the implementation of the HAPIN data management protocol via Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) used to collect over 50\u2005million data points in more than 4000 variables from 80 case report forms (CRFs).","6":"Amid global scarcity of COVID-19 vaccines and the threat of new variant strains, California and other jurisdictions face the question of when and how to implement and relax COVID-19 Nonpharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). While policymakers have attempted to balance the health and economic impacts of the pandemic, decentralized decision-making, deep uncertainty, and the lack of widespread use of comprehensive decision support methods can lead to the choice of fragile or inefficient strategies. This paper uses simulation models and the Robust Decision Making (RDM) approach to stress-test California's reopening strategy and other alternatives over a wide range of futures. We find that plans which respond aggressively to initial outbreaks are required to robustly control the pandemic. Further, the best plans adapt to changing circumstances, lowering their stringent requirements to reopen over time or as more constituents are vaccinated. While we use California as an example, our results are particularly relevant for jurisdictions where vaccination roll-out has been slower.","7":"How a disease is transmitted affects our ability to determine R\u2080, the average number of new cases caused by an infectious host at the onset of an epidemic. R\u2080 becomes progressively more difficult to compute as transmission varies from directly transmitted diseases to diseases that are vector-borne to environmentally transmitted diseases. Pathogens responsible for diseases with environmental transmission are typically maintained in environmental reservoirs that exhibit a complex spatial distribution of local infectious zones (LIZs). Understanding host encounters with LIZs and pathogen persistence within LIZs is required for an accurate R\u2080 and modeling these contacts requires an integrated geospatial and dynamical systems approach. Here we review how interactions between host and pathogen populations and environmental reservoirs are driven by landscape-level variables, and synthesize the quantitative framework needed to formulate outbreak response and disease control.","8":"Support for research on the impacts of climate change on human health is increasing rapidly as people\u0092s direct experience with events such as extreme heat, hurricanes, wildfires, and effects on agriculture also increases. There also is a growing need for research on the health impacts of climate actions including mitigation and adaptation. To facilitate the timeliness and effectiveness of such research, which is critically needed to understand, predict, and prevent climate impacts on health, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences has developed the Climate Change and Human Health Literature Portal [https:\/\/tools.niehs.nih.gov\/cchhl\/index.cfm]. This free, online tool combines searches of the biomedical, environmental, climate, and disaster sciences using PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science to create a bibliographic database of global peer-reviewed research and high-level gray literature. Each unique reference has been tagged by subject matter experts for reference type, exposure, health impact, geographic feature, predictive modeling, and cross-cutting issues such as economics, policy, vulnerable populations, and co-benefits of climate actions. An intuitive user interface includes filters to help users focus their search and quickly find the most relevant results. The majority of references link to a publicly available source, and search result lists can be downloaded and shared through email and social media platforms. References date from 2007 \u00962018, and are continually being added as new science becomes available. The presentation will include demonstration of the Literature Portal, as well as results of analyses of the content for trends in global climate change and human health research.","9":"The perimenopausal transition at middle age is often associated with hot flashes and sleep disruptions, metabolic changes, and other symptoms. Whereas the mechanisms for these processes are incompletely understood, both aging (AG) and a loss of ovarian estrogens play contributing roles. Furthermore, the timing of when estradiol (E) treatment should commence and for how long are key clinical questions in the management of symptoms. Using a rat model of surgical menopause, we determined the effects of regimens of E treatment with differing time at onset and duration of treatment on diurnal rhythms of activity and core temperature and on food intake and body weight. Reproductively mature (MAT, \u223c4\u00a0months) or AG (\u223c11\u00a0months) female rats were ovariectomized, implanted intraperitoneally with a telemetry device, and given either a vehicle (V) or E subcutaneous capsule implantation. Rats were remotely recorded for 10\u00a0days per month for 3 (MAT) or 6 (AG) months. To ascertain whether delayed onset of treatment affected rhythms, a subset of AG-V rats had their capsules switched to E at the end of 3\u00a0months. Another set of AG-E rats had their capsules removed at 3\u00a0months to determine whether beneficial effects of E would persist. Overall, activity and temperature mesor, robustness, and amplitude declined with AG. Compared to V treatment, E-treated rats showed (1) better maintenance of body weight and food intake; (2) higher, more consolidated activity and temperature rhythms; and (3) higher activity and temperature robustness and amplitude. In the AG arm of the study, switching treatment from V to E or E to V quickly reversed these patterns. Thus, the presence of E was the dominant factor in determining stability and amplitude of locomotor activity and temperature rhythms. As a whole, the results show benefits of E treatment, even with a delay, on biological rhythms and physiological functions.","10":"Accounting for the dynamical context, serosurveys could play a key role in efforts to achieve and sustain elimination.High-quality representative serosurveys could provide a more accurate assessment of immunity if challenges of conducting, analyzing, and interpreting them are overcome. We frame the core disease control and elimination questions that could be addressed by improved serological tools, discussing challenges and suggesting approaches to increase the feasibility and sustainability of the tool.Control efforts for measles and rubella are intensifying globally. It becomes increasingly important to identify and reach remaining susceptible populations as elimination is approached.Serological surveys for measles and rubella can potentially measure susceptibility directly, but their use remains rare. In this study, using simulations, we outline key subtleties in interpretation associated with the dynamic context of age-specific immunity, highlighting how the patterns of immunity predicted from disease surveillance and vaccination coverage data may be misleading.","11":"Perceiving greater percentage of 2010-2011 social circle vaccine coverage was associated with a greater likelihood of getting vaccinated in the 2010-2011 flu season (odds ratio [OR] = 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01, 1.04) and the subsequent 2011-2012 flu season (OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.03) but not the 2015-2016 flu season (OR = 1.00, 95% CI = .99, 1.01), as seen in logistic regressions that controlled for demographics and 2009-2010 vaccination behavior. All significant relationships between social circle vaccine coverage and own vaccination behavior were mediated by perceived flu risk without vaccination.Flu vaccinations are recommended for almost everyone, but uptake may vary because of perceived social norms. We aimed to examine the relationship between perceived social circle vaccine coverage (including family, friends, and acquaintances) and own vaccination behavior as well as potential mediators.Perceived social circle vaccine coverage is associated with own vaccination behavior in the current and subsequent flu season, establishing behavior patterns that may persist into the future. People's vaccination decisions may be informed by their perceptions of their peers' beliefs and behaviors. We discuss intervention strategies for promoting vaccine uptake by counteracting negative and promoting positive perceived social norms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).In 2011, 357 participants from RAND's American Life Panel reported perceived social circle vaccine coverage for the 2010-2011 flu season, own vaccination behavior for the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 flu seasons, perceived flu risk without and with vaccination, and perceived vaccine safety. In 2012 and 2016, respectively, participants returned to report their own vaccination behavior for the 2011-2012 flu season (N = 338) and 2015-2016 flu season (N = 216).","12":"This review brings together a collection of studies that specifically use wide-field high-resolution mesoscopic level imaging techniques (intrinsic signal optical imaging; voltage-sensitive dye optical imaging) to image the cortical point spread (PS): the total spread of cortical activation comprising a large neuronal ensemble evoked by spatially restricted (point) stimulation of the sensory periphery (e.g., whisker, pure tone, point visual stimulation). The collective imaging findings, combined with supporting anatomical and electrophysiological findings, revealed some key aspects about the PS including its very large (radius of several mm) and relatively symmetrical spatial extent capable of crossing cytoarchitectural borders and trespassing into other cortical areas; its relationship with underlying evoked subthreshold activity and underlying anatomical system of long-range horizontal projections within gray matter, both also crossing borders; its contextual modulation and plasticity; the ability of its relative spatiotemporal profile to remain invariant to major changes in stimulation parameters; its potential role as a building block for integrative cortical activity; and its ubiquitous presence across various cortical areas and across mammalian species. Together, these findings advance our understanding about the neocortex at the mesoscopic level by underscoring that the cortical PS constitutes a fundamental motif of neocortical structure-function relationship.","13":"Utricularia and Genlisea are highly specialized carnivorous plants whose phylogenetic history has been poorly explored using phylogenomic methods. Additional sampling and genomic data are needed to advance our phylogenetic and taxonomic knowledge of this group of plants. Within a comparative framework, we present a characterization of plastome (PT) and mitochondrial (MT) genes of 26 Utricularia and six Genlisea species, with representatives of all subgenera and growth habits. All PT genomes maintain similar gene content, showing minor variation across the genes located between the PT junctions. One exception is a major variation related to different patterns in the presence and absence of ndh genes in the small single copy region, which appears to follow the phylogenetic history of the species rather than their lifestyle. All MT genomes exhibit similar gene content, with most differences related to a lineage-specific pseudogenes. We find evidence for episodic positive diversifying selection in PT and for most of the Utricularia MT genes that may be related to the current hypothesis that bladderworts' nuclear DNA is under constant ROS oxidative DNA damage and unusual DNA repair mechanisms, or even low fidelity polymerase that bypass lesions which could also be affecting the organellar genomes. Finally, both PT and MT phylogenetic trees were well resolved and highly supported, providing a congruent phylogenomic hypothesis for Utricularia and Genlisea clade given the study sampling.","14":"The 2014-2016 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa was the largest ever recorded, representing a fundamental shift in Ebola epidemiology with unprecedented spatiotemporal complexity. To understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of EVD in West Africa, we developed spatial transmission models using a gravity-model framework at both the national and district-level scales, which we used to compare effectiveness of local interventions (e.g. local quarantine) and long-range interventions (e.g. border-closures). The country-level gravity model captures the epidemic data, including multiple waves of initial epidemic growth observed in Guinea. We found that local-transmission reductions were most effective in Liberia, while long-range transmission was dominant in Sierra Leone. Both models illustrated that interventions in one region result in an amplified protective effect on other regions by preventing spatial transmission. In the district-level model, interventions in the strongest of these amplifying regions reduced total cases in all three countries by over 20%, in spite of the region itself generating only \u223c0.1% of total cases. This model structure and associated intervention analysis provide information that can be used by public health policymakers to assist planning and response efforts for future epidemics.","15":"The themes intersected and impacted the participants' hair journey. Cultural integration was a sub-theme that overlapped within the dominant themes and participants discussed the effect of traditions on their hair experiences.Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), such as phthalates, can negatively impact maternal and child health, contributing to impaired fetal growth, preterm birth, and pregnancy complications, as well as increased downstream risks of cardiometabolic disease and breast cancer. Notably, women of color (WOC) are the largest consumers of personal care products, which are a common source of EDC exposure.The Let's Reclaim Our Ancestral Roots (Let's R.O.A.R) Pilot Study developed an educational intervention delivered during pregnancy to promote reduced use of phthalate-containing hair care products (HCPs). This mixed-methods study included: (1) a quantitative analysis and (2) a qualitative analysis of the educational sessions and the semi-structured focus groups to evaluate the factors that influenced the hair care practices and product choices of WOC at various stages of life, including their current pregnancy (hereafter referred to as the hair journey). During the sessions, participants learned about EDCs (with a focus on phthalates), the unequal burden of exposure for WOC, adverse implications of exposure, and exposure reduction strategies. Focus group sessions provided insight into participants' hair journeys from childhood to the current pregnancy and explored factors during their hair product selection process. All sessions were transcribed and imported into NVivo Version 12 for coding and thematic analysis.A total of 46 individuals were enrolled in the study, and 31 participated in an educational session. This current work synthesizes the qualitative analysis of this study. We identified two important life stages (before and after gaining agency over hair care practices and product choices) and three dominant themes related to HCP use: (1) products that impacted the hair journey, which involved all mentions of hair products, (2) factors that influenced the hair journey, which included individuals or entities that shaped participants' hair experiences, and (3) the relationship between hair and sense of self, where sense of self was defined as the alignment of one's inner and outer beauty.","16":"Social and behavioural factors are critical to the emergence, spread and containment of human disease, and are key determinants of the course, duration and outcomes of disease outbreaks. Recent epidemics of Ebola in West Africa and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) globally have reinforced the importance of developing infectious disease models that better integrate social and behavioural dynamics and theories. Meanwhile, the growth in capacity, coordination and prioritization of social science research and of risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) practice within the current pandemic response provides an opportunity for collaboration among epidemiological modellers, social scientists and RCCE practitioners towards a mutually beneficial research and practice agenda. Here, we provide a review of the current modelling methodologies and describe the challenges and opportunities for integrating them with social science research and RCCE practice. Finally, we set out an agenda for advancing transdisciplinary collaboration for integrated disease modelling and for more robust policy and practice for reducing disease transmission.","17":"The dengue virus affects millions of people every year worldwide, causing large epidemic outbreaks that disrupt people's lives and severely strain healthcare systems. In the absence of a reliable vaccine against dengue or an effective treatment to manage the illness in humans, most efforts to combat dengue infections have focused on preventing its vectors, mainly the Aedes aegypti mosquito, from flourishing across the world. These mosquito-control strategies need reliable disease activity surveillance systems to be deployed. Despite significant efforts to estimate dengue incidence using a variety of data sources and methods, little work has been done to understand the relative contribution of the different data sources to improved prediction. Additionally, scholarship on the topic had initially focused on prediction systems at the national- and state-levels, and much remains to be done at the finer spatial resolutions at which health policy interventions often occur. We develop a methodological framework to assess and compare dengue incidence estimates at the city level, and evaluate the performance of a collection of models on 20 different cities in Brazil. The data sources we use towards this end are weekly incidence counts from prior years (seasonal autoregressive terms), weekly-aggregated weather variables, and real-time internet search data. We find that both random forest-based models and LASSO regression-based models effectively leverage these multiple data sources to produce accurate predictions, and that while the performance between them is comparable on average, the former method produces fewer extreme outliers, and can thus be considered more robust. For real-time predictions that assume long delays (6-8 weeks) in the availability of epidemiological data, we find that real-time internet search data are the strongest predictors of dengue incidence, whereas for predictions that assume short delays (1-3 weeks), in which the error rate is halved (as measured by relative RMSE), short-term and seasonal autocorrelation are the dominant predictors. Despite the difficulties inherent to city-level prediction, our framework achieves meaningful and actionable estimates across cities with different demographic, geographic and epidemic characteristics.","18":"An observational study was conducted among 827 older adults aged \u226575 years in Hong Kong. Sera were collected immediately before and one month after receipt of the 2015\/16 quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. We measured antibody titers with the hemagglutination inhibition assay, and compared mean fold rise in titers from pre- to post-vaccination, and the proportion with post-vaccination titers \u226540 and \u2265160.Immune responses to influenza vaccination can be weaker in older adults than in other age groups. We hypothesized that antibody responses would be particularly weak among repeat vaccinees when the current and prior season vaccine components are the same.Overall, we found that reduced antibody responses in repeat vaccinees were particularly reduced among older adults who had received vaccination against the same strains in preceding years.Participants who reported receipt of vaccination during either of the previous two years had lower mean fold rise against all strains compared to those who were not. Mean fold rises for A(H3N2) and B\/Yamagata were particularly weak following repeated vaccination with the same vaccine strain, but we did not generally find significant differences in the proportion of participants with post-vaccination titers \u226540 and \u2265160.","19":"Host populations often vary in the magnitude of coinfection they experience across environmental gradients. Furthermore, coinfection often occurs sequentially, with a second parasite infecting the host after the first has established a primary infection. Because the local environment and interactions between coinfecting parasites can both drive patterns of coinfection, it is important to disentangle the relative contributions of environmental factors and within-host interactions to patterns of coinfection. Here, we develop a conceptual framework and present an empirical case study to disentangle these facets of coinfection. Across multiple lakes, we surveyed populations of five damselfly (host) species and quantified primary parasitism by aquatic, ectoparasitic water mites and secondary parasitism by terrestrial, endoparasitic gregarines. We first asked if coinfection is predicted by abiotic and biotic factors within the local environment, finding that the probability of coinfection decreased for all host species as pH increased. We then asked if primary infection by aquatic water mites mediated the relationship between pH and secondary infection by terrestrial gregarines. Contrary to our expectations, we found no evidence for a water mite-mediated relationship between pH and gregarines. Instead, the intensity of gregarine infection correlated solely with the local environment, with the magnitude and direction of these relationships varying among environmental predictors. Our findings emphasize the role of the local environment in shaping infection dynamics that set the stage for coinfection. Although we did not detect within-host interactions, the approach herein can be applied to other systems to elucidate the nature of interactions between hosts and coinfecting parasites within complex ecological communities.","20":"To understand the state of climate-health curricula among health professions institutions internationally.Researchers have published surveys on health professionals' perceptions of the possible association between climate change and health (climate-health) and assessed climate-health or planetary health curricula in medical schools. However, curricula on climate-health are still lacking and gaps in knowledge persist.A survey of 160 institutional members of the Global Consortium on Climate and Health Education, which includes international health professions schools and programs, was conducted from August 3, 2017, to March 1, 2018. The survey, hosted by Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, used an online survey tool for data collection.Current climate-health educational offerings appear to vary considerably among health professions institutions. Students, faculty, and administration are important groups to engage when instituting curricula, and awareness, support, and resources may be able to assist in this effort.The survey assessed climate-health curricular offerings across health professions institutions internationally, including existing climate-health educational offerings, method of teaching climate-health education, whether institutions are considering adding climate-health education, whether institutions received a positive response to adding climate-health curricula and\/or encountered challenges in adding curricula, and opportunities to advance climate-health education.Overall response rate to the survey was 53%, with 84 of 160 institutional responses collected; 59 of the responses (70%) were from schools\/programs of public health, health sciences, or health professions; 15 (18%) were from medicine; 9 (11%) were from nursing; and 1 (1%) was from another type of health profession institution. Among respondents, 53 (63%) institutions offer climate-health education, most commonly as part of a required core course (41 [76%]). Sixty-one of 82 respondents (74%) reported that climate-health offerings are under discussion to add, 42 of 59 respondents (71%) encountered some challenges trying to institute the curriculum, and most respondents have received a positive response to adding content, mainly from students (39 of 58 [67%]), faculty (35 of 58 [60%]), and administration (23 of 58 [40%]).","21":"In this prospective cohort study, HCW received 2 doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273.

Viral genomes were sequenced.Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine trials and post-implementation data suggest that vaccination decreases infections. We examine vaccination's impact on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) case rates and viral diversity among health care workers (HCWs) during a high community prevalence period. = .14). Comparison of 50 genomes from post-first dose cases did not indicate selection pressure toward known spike antibody escape mutations.Our results indicate an early positive impact of vaccines on SARS-CoV-2 case rates. Post-vaccination isolates did not show unusual genetic diversity or selection for mutations of concern.","22":"The faculty job market plays a fundamental role in shaping research priorities, educational outcomes, and career trajectories among scientists and institutions. However, a quantitative understanding of faculty hiring as a system is lacking. Using a simple technique to extract the institutional prestige ranking that best explains an observed faculty hiring network-who hires whose graduates as faculty-we present and analyze comprehensive placement data on nearly 19,000 regular faculty in three disparate disciplines. Across disciplines, we find that faculty hiring follows a common and steeply hierarchical structure that reflects profound social inequality. Furthermore, doctoral prestige alone better predicts ultimate placement than a U.S. News & World Report rank, women generally place worse than men, and increased institutional prestige leads to increased faculty production, better faculty placement, and a more influential position within the discipline. These results advance our ability to quantify the influence of prestige in academia and shed new light on the academic system. ","23":"From 2,552 citations identified, 42 articles were included. The first booster provided stronger protection against Omicron than full doses alone, shown by VE estimates of 53.1% (95% CI: 48.0-57.8) vs. 28.6% (95% CI: 18.5-37.4) against infection and 82.5% (95% CI: 77.8-86.2) vs. 57.3% (95% CI: 48.5-64.7) against severe events. The second booster offered strong protection among adults within 60 days of vaccination against infection (VE=53.1%, 95% CI: 48.0-57.8) and severe events (VE=87.3% (95% CI: 75.5-93.4), comparable to the first booster with corresponding VE estimates of 59.9% against infection and 84.8% against severe events. The VE estimates of booster doses against severe events among adults sustained beyond 60 days, 77.6% (95% CI: 69.4-83.6) for first and 85.9% (95% CI: 80.3-89.9) for the second booster. The VE estimates against infection were less sustainable regardless of dose type. Pure mRNA vaccines provided comparable protection to partial mRNA vaccines, but both provided higher protection than non-mRNA vaccines.A rapidly growing body was observed of literature evaluating the vaccine effectiveness (VE) against Omicron in test-negative design studies.One or two SARS-CoV-2 booster doses provide considerable protection against Omicron infection and substantial and sustainable protection against Omicron-induced severe clinical outcomes.We systematically searched papers that evaluated VE of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines on PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Embase, Scopus, bioRxiv, and medRxiv published from November 26th, 2021, to June 27th, 2022 (full doses and the first booster), and to January 8th, 2023 (the second booster). The pooled VE against Omicron-associated infection and severe events were estimated.","24":"DengueSeq was systematically evaluated with virus stocks and clinical specimens spanning the genetic diversity within each of the four dengue virus serotypes. The primer schemes can be plugged into existing amplicon sequencing workflows to facilitate the global need for expanded dengue virus genomic surveillance.We developed primer schemes for the four dengue virus serotypes, which can be combined into a pan-serotype approach. We validated both approaches using genetically diverse virus stocks and clinical specimens that contained a range of virus copies. High genome coverage (>95%) was achieved for all genotypes, except DENV2 (genotype VI) and DENV 4 (genotype IV) sylvatics, with similar performance of the serotype-specific and pan-serotype approaches. The limit of detection to reach 70% coverage was 10-100 RNA copies\/\u03bcL for all four serotypes, which is similar to other commonly used primer schemes. DengueSeq facilitates the sequencing of samples without known serotypes, allows the detection of multiple serotypes in the same sample, and can be used with a variety of library prep kits and sequencing instruments.The increasing burden of dengue virus on public health due to more explosive and frequent outbreaks highlights the need for improved surveillance and control. Genomic surveillance of dengue virus not only provides important insights into the emergence and spread of genetically diverse serotypes and genotypes, but it is also critical to monitor the effectiveness of newly implemented control strategies. Here, we present DengueSeq, an amplicon sequencing protocol, which enables whole-genome sequencing of all four dengue virus serotypes.","25":"Most African countries have recorded relatively lower COVID-19 burdens than Western countries. This has been attributed to early and strong political commitment and robust implementation of public health measures, such as nationwide lockdowns, travel restrictions, face mask wearing, testing, contact tracing, and isolation, along with community education and engagement. Other factors include the younger population age strata and hypothesized but yet-to-be confirmed partially protective cross-immunity from parasitic diseases and\/or other circulating coronaviruses. However, the true burden may also be underestimated due to operational and resource issues for COVID-19 case identification and reporting. In this perspective article, we discuss selected best practices and challenges with COVID-19 contact tracing in Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, and Uganda. Best practices from these country case studies include sustained, multi-platform public communications; leveraging of technology innovations; applied public health expertise; deployment of community health workers; and robust community engagement. Challenges include an overwhelming workload of contact tracing and case detection for healthcare workers, misinformation and stigma, and poorly sustained adherence to isolation and quarantine. Important lessons learned include the need for decentralization of contact tracing to the lowest geographic levels of surveillance, rigorous use of data and technology to improve decision-making, and sustainment of both community sensitization and political commitment. Further research is needed to understand the role and importance of contact tracing in controlling community transmission dynamics in African countries, including among children. Also, implementation science will be critically needed to evaluate innovative, accessible, and cost-effective digital solutions to accommodate the contact tracing workload.","26":"Transmissible vaccines offer a revolutionary approach for controlling infectious disease and may provide one of the few feasible methods for eliminating pathogens from inaccessible wildlife populations. Current efforts to develop transmissible vaccines use recombinant vector technology whereby pathogen antigens are engineered to be expressed from innocuous infectious viral vectors. The resulting vaccines can transmit from host to host, amplifying the number of vaccine-protected individuals beyond those initially vaccinated directly through parenteral inoculation. One main engineering challenge is the potential for natural selection to favor vaccine mutants that eliminate or reduce expression of antigenic inserts, resulting in immunogenic decay of the vaccine over time. Here, we study a mathematical model of vector mutation whereby continuous elimination of the antigenic insert results in reversion of the vaccine back into the insert-free vector. We use this model to quantify the maximum allowable rate of reversion that can be tolerated for a transmissible vaccine to maintain a critical threshold level of immunogenicity against a target pathogen. Our results demonstrate that even for transmissible vaccines where reversion is frequent, performance will often substantially exceed that of conventional, directly administered vaccines. Further, our results demonstrate the feasibility of designing transmissible vaccines that yield desired levels of immunogenicity, yet degrade at a rate sufficient for persistence of the recombinant vaccine within the environment to be minimized.","27":"Implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for both populations and healthcare systems are vast. In addition to morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, the pandemic also disrupted local health systems, including reductions or delays in routine vaccination services and catch-up vaccination campaigns. These disruptions could lead to outbreaks of other infectious diseases that result in an additional burden of disease and strain on the healthcare system. We evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Zambia's routine childhood immunization program in 2020 using multiple sources of data. We relied on administrative vaccination data and Zambia's 2018 Demographic and Health Survey to project national disruptions to district-specific routine childhood vaccination coverage within the pandemic year 2020. Next, we leveraged a 2016 population-based serological survey to predict age-specific measles seroprevalence and assessed the impact of changes in vaccination coverage on measles outbreak risk in each district. We found minor disruptions to routine administration of measles-rubella and pentavalent vaccines in 2020. This was in part due to Zambia's Child Health Week held in June of 2020 which helped to reach children missed during the first six months of the year. We estimated that the two-month delay in a measles-rubella vaccination campaign, originally planned for September of 2020 but conducted in November of 2020 as a result of the pandemic, had little impact on modeled district-specific measles outbreak risks. This study estimated minimal increases in the number of children missed by vaccination services in Zambia during 2020. However, the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission since our analysis concluded means efforts to maintain routine immunization services and minimize the risk of measles outbreaks will continue to be critical. The methodological framework developed in this analysis relied on routinely collected data to estimate disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic to national routine vaccination program performance and its impact on children missed at the subnational level can be deployed in other countries or for other vaccines.","28":"Background\r\nMuch of the extensive research regarding transmission of malaria is underpinned by mathematical modelling. Compartmental models, which focus on interactions and transitions between population strata, have been a mainstay of such modelling for more than a century. However, modellers are increasingly adopting agent-based approaches, which model hosts, vectors and\/or their interactions on an individual level. One reason for the increasing popularity of such models is their potential to provide enhanced realism by allowing system-level behaviours to emerge as a consequence of accumulated individual-level interactions, as occurs in real populations.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nA systematic review of 90 articles published between 1998 and May 2018 was performed, characterizing agent-based models (ABMs) relevant to malaria transmission. The review provides an overview of approaches used to date, determines the advantages of these approaches, and proposes ideas for progressing the field.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nThe rationale for ABM use over other modelling approaches centres around three points: the need to accurately represent increased stochasticity in low-transmission settings; the benefits of high-resolution spatial simulations; and heterogeneities in drug and vaccine efficacies due to individual patient characteristics. The success of these approaches provides avenues for further exploration of agent-based techniques for modelling malaria transmission. Potential extensions include varying elimination strategies across spatial landscapes, extending the size of spatial models, incorporating human movement dynamics, and developing increasingly comprehensive parameter estimation and optimization techniques.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nCollectively, the literature covers an extensive array of topics, including the full spectrum of transmission and intervention regimes. Bringing these elements together under a common framework may enhance knowledge of, and guide policies towards, malaria elimination. However, because of the diversity of available models, endorsing a standardized approach to ABM implementation may not be possible. Instead it is recommended that model frameworks be contextually appropriate and sufficiently described. One key recommendation is to develop enhanced parameter estimation and optimization techniques. Extensions of current techniques will provide the robust results required to enhance current elimination efforts.","29":"Antiviral chemoprophylaxis is recommended for use during influenza outbreaks in nursing homes to prevent transmission and severe disease among non-ill residents. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance recommends prophylaxis be initiated for all non-ill residents once an influenza outbreak is detected and be continued for at least 14 days and until seven days after the last laboratory-confirmed influenza case is identified. However, not all facilities strictly adhere to this guidance and the impact of such partial adherence is not fully understood.Prophylaxis implemented according to current guidance reduced total symptomatic illnesses and hospitalizations among residents by an average of 12% and 36%, respectively, compared with no prophylaxis. We did not find evidence that alternative implementations of prophylaxis were more effective: compared to full adoption of current guidance, partial adoption resulted in increased symptomatic illnesses and\/or hospitalizations, and longer or earlier adoption offered no additional improvements. In addition, increasing uptake and adherence among nursing home residents was effective in reducing resident illnesses and hospitalizations, but increasing HCP uptake had minimal indirect impacts for residents.The greatest benefits of influenza prophylaxis during nursing home outbreaks will likely be achieved through increasing uptake and adherence among residents and following current CDC guidance.We developed a stochastic compartmental framework to model influenza transmission within an average-sized U.S. nursing home. We compared the number of symptomatic illnesses and hospitalizations under varying prophylaxis implementation strategies, in addition to different levels of prophylaxis uptake and adherence by residents and healthcare personnel (HCP).","30":" was 1.07. The constant FOI could have been due to the predominant mode of infection being transmission of Brucella from contaminated aborted materials during grazing. Direct purchase of infected cattle could facilitate efficient transmission between susceptible animals through abortion.","31":"We found that at a vaccination rate of 1 million doses per day, an emergent SGTF variant that is 20-70% more transmissible than the original variant would become dominant within 2 to 9 weeks, accounting for as much as 99% of cases at the outbreak peak. Our results show that accelerating vaccine delivery would substantially reduce severe health outcomes. For a SGTF with 30% higher transmissibility, increasing vaccine doses from 1 to 3 million per day would avert 152,048 (95% CrI: 134,772-168,696) hospitalizations and 48,448 (95% CrI: 42,042-54,285) deaths over 300 days. Accelerated vaccination would also prevent additional COVID-19 waves that would otherwise be fuelled by waning adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs).We found that the current pace of vaccine rollout is insufficient to prevent the exacerbation of the pandemic that will be attributable to the novel, more contagious SARS-CoV-2 variants. Accelerating the vaccination rate should be a public health priority for averting the expected surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths that would be associated with widespread dissemination of the SGTF variants. Our results underscore the need to bolster the production and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, to rapidly expand vaccination priority groups and distribution sites.More contagious variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged around the world, sparking concerns about impending surge in cases and severe outcomes. Despite the development of effective vaccines, rollout has been slow. We evaluated the impact of accelerated vaccine distribution on curbing the disease burden of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants.We used an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and vaccination to simulate the spread of novel variants with S-Gene Target Failure (SGTF) in addition to the original strain. We incorporated age-specific risk and contact patterns and implemented a two-dose vaccination campaign in accord with CDC-recommended prioritization. As a base case, we projected hospitalizations and deaths at a daily vaccination rate of 1 million doses in the United States (US) and compared with accelerated campaigns in which daily doses were expanded to 1.5, 2, 2.5, or 3 million.","32":"Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a wet, low temperature thermal conversion process that continues to gain attention for the generation of hydrochar. The importance of specific process conditions and feedstock properties on hydrochar characteristics is not well understood. To evaluate this, linear and non-linear models were developed to describe hydrochar characteristics based on data collected from HTC-related literature. A Sobol analysis was subsequently conducted to identify parameters that most influence hydrochar characteristics. Results from this analysis indicate that for each investigated hydrochar property, the model fit and predictive capability associated with the random forest models is superior to both the linear and regression tree models. Based on results from the Sobol analysis, the feedstock properties and process conditions most influential on hydrochar yield, carbon content, and energy content were identified. In addition, a variational process parameter sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine how feedstock property importance changes with process conditions.","33":"Delays in seeking appropriate healthcare can increase the case fatality of acute febrile illnesses, and circuitous routes of care-seeking can have a catastrophic financial impact upon patients in low-income settings. To investigate the relationship between poverty and pre-hospital delays for patients with acute febrile illnesses, we recruited a cross-sectional, convenience sample of 527 acutely ill adults and children aged over 6 months, with a documented fever 38.0\u00b0C and symptoms of up to 14 days\u0092 duration, presenting to a tertiary referral hospital in Chittagong, Bangladesh, over the course of one year from September 2011 to September 2012. Participants were classified according to the socioeconomic status of their households, defined by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative\u0092s multidimensional poverty index (MPI). 51% of participants were classified as multidimensionally poor (MPI>0.33). Median time from onset of any symptoms to arrival at hospital was 22 hours longer for MPI poor adults compared to non-poor adults (123 vs. 101 hours) rising to a difference of 26 hours with adjustment in a multivariate regression model (95% confidence interval 7 to 46 hours; P = 0.009). There was no difference in delays for children from poor and non-poor households (97 vs. 119 hours; P = 0.394). Case fatality was 5.9%\r\nvs. 0.8% in poor and non-poor individuals respectively (P = 0.001)\u00975.1% vs. 0.0% for poor and non-poor adults (P = 0.010) and 6.4% vs. 1.8% for poor and non-poor children (P =0.083). Deaths were attributed to central nervous system infection (11), malaria (3), urinary tract infection (2), gastrointestinal infection (1) and undifferentiated sepsis (1). Both poor and non-poor households relied predominantly upon the (often informal) private sector for medical advice before reaching the referral hospital, but MPI poor participants were less likely to have consulted a qualified doctor. Poor participants were more likely to attribute delays in decision-making and travel to a lack of money (P<0.001), and more likely to face catastrophic expenditure of more than 25% of monthly household income (P<0.001). We conclude that multidimensional poverty is associated with greater pre-hospital delays and expenditure in this setting. Closer links between health and development agendas could address these consequences of poverty and streamline access to adequate healthcare","34":"Emerging infectious diseases are a growing threat in sub-Saharan African countries, but the human and technical capacity to quickly respond to outbreaks remains limited. Here, we describe the experience and lessons learned from a joint project with the WHO Regional Office for Africa (WHO AFRO) to support the sub-Saharan African COVID-19 response.In June 2020, WHO AFRO contracted a number of consultants to reinforce the COVID-19 response in member states by providing actionable epidemiological analysis. Given the urgency of the situation and the magnitude of work required, we recruited a worldwide network of field experts, academics and students in the areas of public health, data science and social science to support the effort. Most analyses were performed on a merged line list of COVID-19 cases using a reverse engineering model (line listing built using data extracted from national situation reports shared by countries with the Regional Office for Africa as per the IHR (2005) obligations). The data analysis platform The Renku Project ( https:\/\/renkulab.io ) provided secure data storage and permitted collaborative coding.Over a period of 6\u2009months, 63 contributors from 32 nations (including 17 African countries) participated in the project. A total of 45 in-depth country-specific epidemiological reports and data quality reports were prepared for 28 countries. Spatial transmission and mortality risk indices were developed for 23 countries. Text and video-based training modules were developed to integrate and mentor new members. The team also began to develop EpiGraph Hub, a web application that automates the generation of reports similar to those we created, and includes more advanced data analyses features (e.g. mathematical models, geospatial analyses) to deliver real-time, actionable results to decision-makers.Within a short period, we implemented a global collaborative approach to health data management and analyses to advance national responses to health emergencies and outbreaks. The interdisciplinary team, the hands-on training and mentoring, and the participation of local researchers were key to the success of this initiative.","35":"Efforts to monitoring and managing hospital capacity depend on the ability to extract relevant time-stamped data from electronic medical records and other information technologies. However, the various characterizations of patient flow, cohort decisions, sub-processes, and the diverse stakeholders requiring data visibility create further overlying complexity. We use the Donabedian model to prioritize patient flow metrics and build an electronic dashboard for enabling communication. Ten metrics were identified as key indicators including outcome (length of stay, 30-day readmission, operating room exit delays, capacity-related diversions), process (timely inpatient unit discharge, emergency department disposition), and structural metrics (occupancy, discharge volume, boarding, bed assignation duration). Dashboard users provided real-life examples of how the tool is assisting capacity improvement efforts, and user traffic data revealed an uptrend in dashboard utilization from May to October 2017 (26 to 148 views per month, respectively). Our main contributions are twofold. The former being the results and methods for selecting key performance indicators for a unit, department, and across the entire hospital (i.e., separating signal from noise). The latter being an electronic dashboard deployed and used at The Johns Hopkins Hospital to visualize these ten metrics and communicate systematically to hospital stakeholders. Integration of diverse information technology may create further opportunities for improved hospital capacity.","36":"Recent advances in clinical prediction for diarrhoeal aetiology in low- and middle-income countries have revealed that the addition of weather data to clinical data improves predictive performance. However, the optimal source of weather data remains unclear. We aim to compare the use of model estimated satellite- and ground-based observational data with weather station directly observed data for the prediction of aetiology of diarrhoea. We used clinical and etiological data from a large multi-centre study of children with moderate to severe diarrhoea cases to compare their predictive performances. We show that the two sources of weather conditions perform similarly in most locations. We conclude that while model estimated data is a viable, scalable tool for public health interventions and disease prediction, given its ease of access, directly observed weather station data is likely adequate for the prediction of diarrhoeal aetiology in children in low- and middle-income countries.","37":"The proposed economic analysis is a useful tool to examine economic value of a WGS surveillance-based IP program. These methods will be applied to a prospective evaluation of WGS surveillance compared to SoC.The economic value of a WGS surveillance-based IP program was assessed from a hospital's perspective using historical outbreaks from 2011-2016. We used transmission network of outbreaks to estimate incremental cost per transmission averted. The number of transmissions averted depended on the effectiveness of intervening against transmission routes, time from transmission to positive culture results and time taken to obtain WGS results and intervene on the transmission route identified. The total cost of an IP program included cost of staffing, WGS, and treating infections.Whole genome sequencing (WGS) surveillance and electronic health record data mining have the potential to greatly enhance the identification and control of hospital outbreaks. The objective was to develop methods for examining economic value of a WGS surveillance-based infection prevention (IP) program compared to Standard of Care (SoC).Approximately 41 out of 89 (46%) transmissions could have been averted under the WGS surveillance-based IP program and it was found to be a less costly and more effective strategy than SoC. The results were most sensitive to the cost of performing WGS and the number of isolates sequenced per year under WGS surveillance. The probability of the WGS surveillance-based IP program being cost-effective was 80% if willingness to pay exceeded $2,400 per transmission averted.","38":"During outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging infections, the lack of effective drugs and vaccines increases reliance on non-pharmacologic public health interventions and behavior change to limit human-to-human transmission. Interventions that increase the speed with which infected individuals remove themselves from the susceptible population are paramount, particularly isolation and hospitalization. Ebola virus disease (EVD), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are zoonotic viruses that have caused significant recent outbreaks with sustained human-to-human transmission.We found that epidemic week and viral serial interval were correlated with the speed with which populations developed and maintained health behaviors in each outbreak.This investigation quantified changing mean removal rates (MRR) and days from symptom onset to hospitalization (DSOH) of infected individuals from the population in seven different outbreaks of EVD, SARS, and MERS, to test for statistically significant differences in these metrics between outbreaks.These findings highlight intrinsic population-level changes in isolation rates in multiple epidemics of three zoonotic infections with established human-to-human transmission and significant morbidity and mortality. These data are particularly useful for disease modelers seeking to forecast the spread of emerging pathogens.","39":"Vaccination against pertussis has reduced the disease burden dramatically, but the most severe cases and almost all fatalities occur in infants too young to be vaccinated. Recent epidemiologic evidence suggests that targeted vaccination of mothers during pregnancy can reduce pertussis incidence in their infants. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of antepartum maternal vaccination in the United States, we created an age-stratified transmission model, incorporating empirical data on US contact patterns and explicitly modeling parent-infant exposure. Antepartum maternal vaccination incurs costs of $114,000 (95% prediction interval: 82,000, 183,000) per quality-adjusted life-year, in comparison with the strategy of no adult vaccination, and is cost-effective in the United States according to World Health Organization criteria. By contrast, vaccinating a second parent is not cost-effective, and vaccination of either parent postpartum is strongly dominated by antepartum maternal vaccination. Nonetheless, postpartum vaccination of mothers who were not vaccinated antepartum improves upon the current recommendation of untargeted adult vaccination. Additionally, the temporary direct protection of the infant due to maternal antibody transfer has efficacy for infants comparable to that conferred to toddlers by the full primary vaccination series. Efficient protection against pertussis for infants begins before birth. We highly recommend antepartum vaccination for as many US mothers as possible.","40":"It has been shown that activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) suppresses proliferation of a variety of tumor cells as well as nonmalignant cells. In this study, we used post-transcriptional gene silencing with small interfering RNA (siRNA) to specifically examine the effect of AMPK on pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) proliferation and to further elucidate its underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results showed that knockdown of AMPK\u03b12 promoted primary cultured PASMCs proliferation; this was accompanied with the elevation of phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2) protein level and reduction of p27(Kip1). Importantly, prior silencing of mTOR with siRNA abolished AMPK\u03b12 knockdown-induced Skp2 upregulation, p27(Kip1) reduction as well as PASMCs proliferation. Furthermore, pre-depletion of Skp2 by siRNA also eliminated p27(Kip1) downregulation and PASMCs proliferation caused by AMPK\u03b12 knockdown. Taken together, our study indicates that AMPK\u03b12 isoform plays an important role in regulation of PASMCs proliferation by modulating mTOR\/Skp2\/p27(Kip1) axis, and suggests that activation of AMPK\u03b12 might have potential value in the prevention and treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. ","41":"Localized cartilage lesions in early osteoarthritis and acute joint injuries are usually treated surgically to restore function and relieve pain. However, a persistent clinical challenge remains in how to repair the cartilage lesions. We expressed doublecortin (DCX) in human adipose-derived stromal\/stem cells (hASCs) and engineered hASCs into cartilage tissues using an in vitro 96-well pellet culture system. The cartilage tissue constructs with and without DCX expression were implanted in the knee cartilage defects of rabbits (n\u2009=\u200942) and monkeys (n\u2009=\u200912). Cohorts of animals were euthanized at 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery to evaluate the cartilage repair outcomes. We found that DCX expression in hASCs increased expression of growth differentiation factor 5 (GDF5) and matrilin 2 in the engineered cartilage tissues. The cartilage tissues with DCX expression significantly enhanced cartilage repair as assessed macroscopically and histologically at 6, 12, and 24 months after implantation in the rabbits and 24 months after implantation in the monkeys, compared to the cartilage tissues without DCX expression. These findings suggest that hASCs expressing DCX may be engineered into cartilage tissues that can be used to treat localized cartilage lesions.","42":"We analysed the interplay between palmiped farm density and the vulnerability of the poultry production system to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8. To do so, we used a spatially-explicit transmission model, which was calibrated to reproduce the observed spatio-temporal distribution of outbreaks in France during the 2016-2017 epidemic of HPAI. Six scenarios were investigated, in which the density of palmiped farms was decreased in the municipalities with the highest palmiped farm density. For each of the six scenarios, we first calculated the spatial distribution of the basic reproduction number (R0), i.e. the expected number of farms a particular farm would be likely to infect, should all other farms be susceptible. We also ran in silico simulations of the adjusted model for each scenario to estimate epidemic sizes and time-varying effective reproduction numbers. We showed that reducing palmiped farm density in the densest municipalities decreased substantially the size of the areas with high R0 values (>\u20091.5). In silico simulations suggested that reducing palmiped farm density, even slightly, in the densest municipalities was expected to decrease substantially the number of affected poultry farms and therefore provide benefits to the poultry sector as a whole. However, they also suggest that it would not have been sufficient, even in combination with the intervention measures implemented during the 2016-2017 epidemic, to completely prevent the virus from spreading. Therefore, the effectiveness of alternative structural preventive approaches now needs to be assessed, including flock size reduction and targeted vaccination.","43":"We attempted PCR amplification on 184 samples; 19 samples amplified sufficiently to perform sequencing. Of these, 8 samples yielded sequences with at least 50% coverage. Our phylogeographic reconstruction indicates two separate introductions of ZIKV to Colombia, one of which was previously unrecognized. We find that ZIKV was first introduced to Colombia in February 2015 (95%CI: Jan 2015 - Apr 2015), corresponding to 5 to 8 months of cryptic ZIKV transmission prior to confirmation in September 2015. Despite the presence of multiple introductions, we find that the majority of Colombian ZIKV diversity descends from a single introduction. We find evidence for movement of ZIKV from Colombia into bordering countries, including Peru, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela.Colombia was the second most affected country during the American Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic, with over 109,000 reported cases. Despite the scale of the outbreak, limited genomic sequence data were available from Colombia. We sought to sequence additional samples and use genomic epidemiology to describe ZIKV dynamics in Colombia.Similarly to genomic epidemiological studies of ZIKV dynamics in other countries, we find that ZIKV circulated cryptically in Colombia. More accurately dating when ZIKV was circulating refines our definition of the population at risk. Additionally, our finding that the majority of ZIKV transmission within Colombia was attributable to transmission between individuals, rather than repeated travel-related importations, indicates that improved detection and control might have succeeded in limiting the scale of the outbreak within Colombia.We sequenced ZIKV genomes directly from clinical diagnostic specimens and infected Aedes aegypti samples selected to cover the temporal and geographic breadth of the Colombian outbreak. We performed phylogeographic analysis of these genomes, along with other publicly-available ZIKV genomes from the Americas, to estimate the frequency and timing of ZIKV introductions to Colombia.","44":"We analyzed top-viewed YouTube COVID-19-related videos in English from December 1, 2019 to August 16, 2020 with an open inductive content analysis. We coded 536 videos associated with 1.1 billion views across the study period. East Asian countries were the first to report the virus, while most of the top-viewed videos in English were from the US. Videos from straight news outlets dominated the top-viewed videos throughout the outbreak, and public health authorities contributed the fewest. Although straight news was the dominant COVID-19 video source with various types of themes, its viewership per video was similar to that for entertainment news and YouTubers after March.We found, first, that collective public attention to the COVID-19 pandemic on YouTube peaked around March 2020, before the outbreak peaked, and flattened afterwards despite a spike in worldwide cases. Second, more videos focused on prevention early on, but videos with political themes increased through time. Third, regarding prevention and control measures, masking received much less attention than lockdown and social distancing in the study period.The COVID-19 pandemic is the first pandemic where social media platforms relayed information on a large scale, enabling an \"infodemic\" of conflicting information which undermined the global response to the pandemic. Understanding how the information circulated and evolved on social media platforms is essential for planning future public health campaigns. This study investigated what types of themes about COVID-19 were most viewed on YouTube during the first 8\u00a0months of the pandemic, and how COVID-19 themes progressed over this period.Our study suggests that a transition of focus from science to politics on social media intensified the COVID-19 infodemic and may have weakened mitigation measures during the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is recommended that authorities should consider co-operating with reputable social media influencers to promote health campaigns and improve health literacy. In addition, given high levels of globalization of social platforms and polarization of users, tailoring communication towards different digital communities is likely to be essential.","45":"serosim is an open-source R package designed to aid inference from serological studies, by simulating data arising from user-specified vaccine and antibody kinetics processes using a random effects model. Serological data are used to assess population immunity by directly measuring individuals' antibody titers. They uncover locations and\/or populations which are susceptible and provide evidence of past infection or vaccination to help inform public health measures and surveillance. Both serological data and new analytical techniques used to interpret them are increasingly widespread. This creates a need for tools to simulate serological studies and the processes underlying observed titer values, as this will enable researchers to identify best practices for serological study design, and provide a standardized framework to evaluate the performance of different inference methods. serosim allows users to specify and adjust model inputs representing underlying processes responsible for generating the observed titer values like time-varying patterns of infection and vaccination, population demography, immunity and antibody kinetics, and serological sampling design in order to best represent the population and disease system(s) of interest. This package will be useful for planning sampling design of future serological studies, understanding determinants of observed serological data, and validating the accuracy and power of new statistical methods.","46":"Accurate real-time tracking of influenza outbreaks helps public health officials make timely and meaningful decisions that could save lives. We propose an influenza tracking model, ARGO (AutoRegression with GOogle search data), that uses publicly available online search data. In addition to having a rigorous statistical foundation, ARGO outperforms all previously available Google-search-based tracking models, including the latest version of Google Flu Trends, even though it uses only low-quality search data as input from publicly available Google Trends and Google Correlate websites. ARGO not only incorporates the seasonality in influenza epidemics but also captures changes in people's online search behavior over time. ARGO is also flexible, self-correcting, robust, and scalable, making it a potentially powerful tool that can be used for real-time tracking of other social events at multiple temporal and spatial resolutions. ","47":"As coronavirus disease spreads throughout the United States, policymakers are contemplating reinstatement and relaxation of shelter-in-place orders. By using a model capturing high-risk populations and transmission rates estimated from hospitalization data, we found that postponing relaxation will only delay future disease waves. Cocooning vulnerable populations can prevent overwhelming medical surges.","48":"Mosquito-borne viruses are the cause of significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Assessing risk for viral transmission often involves characterization of the vector competence of vector-virus pairings. The most common determination of vector competence uses discreet, terminal time points, which cannot be used to investigate variation in transmission aspects, such as biting behavior, over time. Here, we present a novel method to longitudinally measure individual biting behavior and Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission. Individual mosquitoes were exposed to ZIKV, and from 9 to 24 days post-exposure, individuals were each offered a 180 \u03bcL bloodmeal every other day. Biting behavior was observed and characterized as either active probing, feeding, or no bite. The bloodmeal was then collected, spun down, serum collected, and tested for ZIKV RNA via qRT-PCR to determine individuals' vector competence over time. This included whether transmission to the bloodmeal was successful and the titer of expectorated virus. Additionally, serum was inoculated onto Vero cells in order to determine infectiousness of positive recovered sera. Results demonstrate heterogeneity in not only biting patterns but expectorated viral titers among individual mosquitoes over time. These findings demonstrate that the act of transmission is a complex process governed by mosquito behavior and mosquito-virus interaction, and herein we offer a method to investigate this phenomenon.","49":"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global health issue. Current measures for tackling it comprise mainly the prudent use of drugs, the development of new drugs, and rapid diagnostics. Relatively little attention has been given to forecasting the evolution of resistance. Here, we argue that forecasting has the potential to be a great asset in our arsenal of measures to tackle AMR. We argue that, if successfully implemented, forecasting resistance will help to resolve the antibiotic crisis in three ways: it will (i) guide a more sustainable use (and therefore lifespan) of antibiotics and incentivize investment in drug development, (ii) reduce the spread of AMR genes and pathogenic microbes in the environment and between patients, and (iii) allow more efficient treatment of persistent infections, reducing the continued evolution of resistance. We identify two important challenges that need to be addressed for the successful establishment of forecasting: (i) the development of bespoke technology that allows stakeholders to empirically assess the risks of resistance evolving during the process of drug development and therapeutic\/preventive use, and (ii) the transformative shift in mindset from the current praxis of mostly addressing the problem of antibiotic resistance a posteriori to a concept of a priori estimating, and acting on, the risks of resistance.","50":"\u2009<\u20090.001. Participants switched to second-line ART without resistance displayed inferior adherence and had higher rates of virologic failure. Therefore, these individuals warrant additional adherence interventions to help them achieve virologic success. Clinical Trial Registration number: NCT00608569.","51":"The global economic downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic, war in Ukraine, and worldwide inflation surge may have a profound impact on poverty-related infectious diseases, especially in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). In this work, we developed mathematical models for HIV\/AIDS and Tuberculosis (TB) in Brazil, one of the largest and most unequal LMICs, incorporating poverty rates and temporal dynamics to evaluate and forecast the impact of the increase in poverty due to the economic crisis, and estimate the mitigation effects of alternative poverty-reduction policies on the incidence and mortality from AIDS and TB up to 2030. Three main intervention scenarios were simulated-an economic crisis followed by the implementation of social protection policies with none, moderate, or strong coverage-evaluating the incidence and mortality from AIDS and TB. Without social protection policies to mitigate the impact of the economic crisis, the burden of HIV\/AIDS and TB would be significantly larger over the next decade, being responsible in 2030 for an incidence 13% (95% CI 4-31%) and mortality 21% (95% CI 12-34%) higher for HIV\/AIDS, and an incidence 16% (95% CI 10-25%) and mortality 22% (95% CI 15-31%) higher for TB, if compared with a scenario of moderate social protection. These differences would be significantly larger if compared with a scenario of strong social protection, resulting in more than 230,000 cases and 34,000 deaths from AIDS and TB averted over the next decade in Brazil. Using a comprehensive approach, that integrated economic forecasting with mathematical and epidemiological models, we were able to show the importance of implementing robust social protection policies to avert a significant increase in incidence and mortality from AIDS and TB during the current global economic downturn.","52":"Coxsackievirus A6 emerged as one of the predominant causative agents of hand, foot and mouth disease epidemics in many provinces of China in 2013 and 2015. This virus strain accounted for 25.9% of mild and 15.2% of severe cases in 2013 and 25.8% of mild and 16.9% of severe cases in 2015.","53":"Wolbachia intracellular bacteria successfully reduce the transmissibility of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) when introduced into virus-carrying vectors such as mosquitoes. Despite the progress made by introducing Wolbachia bacteria into the Aedes aegypti wild-type population to control arboviral infections, reports suggest that heat-induced loss-of-Wolbachia-infection as a result of climate change may reverse these gains. Novel, supplemental Wolbachia strains that are more resilient to increased temperatures may circumvent these concerns, and could potentially act synergistically with existing variants. In this article, we model the ecological dynamics among three distinct mosquito (sub)populations: a wild-type population free of any Wolbachia infection; an invading population infected with a particular Wolbachia strain; and a second invading population infected with a distinct Wolbachia strain from that of the first invader. We explore how the range of possible characteristics of each Wolbachia strain impacts mosquito prevalence. Further, we analyse the differential system governing the mosquito populations and the Wolbachia infection dynamics by computing the full set of basic and invasive reproduction numbers and use these to establish stability of identified equilibria. Our results show that releasing mosquitoes with two different strains of Wolbachia did not increase their prevalence, compared with a single-strain Wolbachia-infected mosquito introduction and only delayed Wolbachia dominance.","54":"We analyzed the genomic diversity of Staphylococcus aureus, a globally prevalent bacterial species that causes serious infections in humans. Our goal was to build a genetic picture of the different strains of S. aureus and which genes may be associated with them. We reprocessed >84,000 genomes and subsampled to remove redundancy. We found that individual samples sharing >99.5% of their genome could be grouped into strains. We also showed that a portion of genes that are present in intermediate frequency in the species are strongly associated with some strains but completely absent from others, suggesting a role in strain specificity. This work lays the foundation for understanding individual gene histories of the S. aureus species and also outlines strategies for processing large bacterial genomic data sets.Staphylococcus aureus causes both hospital- and community-acquired infections in humans worldwide. Due to the high incidence of infection, S. aureus is also one of the most sampled and sequenced pathogens today, providing an outstanding resource to understand variation at the bacterial subspecies level. We processed and downsampled 83,383 public S. aureus Illumina whole-genome shotgun sequences and 1,263 complete genomes to produce 7,954 representative substrains. Pairwise comparison of average nucleotide identity revealed a natural boundary of 99.5% that could be used to define 145 distinct strains within the species. We found that intermediate frequency genes in the pangenome (present in 10%-95% of genomes) could be divided into those closely linked to strain background (\"strain-concentrated\") and those highly variable within strains (\"strain-diffuse\"). Non-core genes had different patterns of chromosome location. Notably, strain-diffuse genes were associated with prophages; strain-concentrated genes were associated with the vSa\u03b2 genome island and rare genes (<10% frequency) concentrated near the origin of replication. Antibiotic resistance genes were enriched in the strain-diffuse class, while virulence genes were distributed between strain-diffuse, strain-concentrated, core, and rare classes. This study shows how different patterns of gene movement help create strains as distinct subspecies entities and provide insight into the diverse histories of important S. aureus functions.","55":"In this paper, we consider the problem of finding approximate inverses of a given matrix. We give an explicit solution to the rank-constrained regularized inverse approximation problem and obtain an inverse-regularized Eckart\u0096Young-like theorem.","56":"We and others have previously shown that genetic association can be used to make causal connections between gene loci and small molecules measured by mass spectrometry in the bloodstream and in tissues. We identified a locus on mouse chromosome 7 where several phospholipids in liver showed strong genetic association to distinct gene loci. In this study, we integrated gene expression data with genetic association data to identify a single gene at the chromosome 7 locus as the driver of the phospholipid phenotypes. The gene encodes \u03b1\/\u03b2-hydrolase domain 2 ( Abhd2 ), one of 23 members of the ABHD gene family. We validated this observation by measuring lipids in a mouse with a whole-body deletion of Abhd2 . The Abhd2 KO mice had a significant increase in liver levels of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Unexpectedly, we also found a decrease in two key mitochondrial lipids, cardiolipin and phosphatidylglycerol, in male Abhd2 KO mice. These data suggest that Abhd2 plays a role in the synthesis, turnover, or remodeling of liver phospholipids.","57":"Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive bleeding disorder caused by FVIII gene deficiency, which may result in spontaneous joint hemorrhages or life-threatening bleeding. Currently, cell-based gene therapy via ex vivo transduction of transplantable cells with integrating gene-expressing vectors offers an attractive treatment for HA. In present study, we targeted an expression cassette of B-domain-deleted FVIII into the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) by transfection with a nonviral targeting plasmid pHrn. The targeted hESCs clone could be expanded and retained the main pluripotent properties of differentiation into three germ layers both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, under defined induction conditions, the targeted hESCs could differentiated into functional mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and hepatocytes, as validated by relevant specific cell markers and functional examination. Tumorgenesis assay demonstrated that these cells are relatively safe for future applications. Analysis on gene expression revealed that exogenous FVIII mRNA and FVIII proteins were both present in differentiated MSCs and hepatocytes. These results indicated that through gene targeting at hESCs rDNA locus a persistent cell source of transplantable genetic-modified cells can be accomplished for HA therapy.","58":"The generation interval is the interval between the time when an individual is infected by an infector and the time when this infector was infected. Its distribution underpins estimates of the reproductive number and hence informs public health strategies. Empirical generation-interval distributions are often derived from contact-tracing data. But linking observed generation intervals to the underlying generation interval required for modelling purposes is surprisingly not straightforward, and misspecifications can lead to incorrect estimates of the reproductive number, with the potential to misguide interventions to stop or slow an epidemic. Here, we clarify the theoretical framework for three conceptually different generation-interval distributions: the 'intrinsic' one typically used in mathematical models and the 'forward' and 'backward' ones typically observed from contact-tracing data, looking, respectively, forward or backward in time. We explain how the relationship between these distributions changes as an epidemic progresses and discuss how empirical generation-interval data can be used to correctly inform mathematical models.","59":" parasite prevalence was measured using an RDT and by quantitative PCR (qPCR). A 24-single nucleotide polymorphism molecular bar-code assay was used to genotype parasites. Eighty-four index case households with 676 residents were enrolled between March 2016 and March 2018. Within each season, parasite prevalence declined significantly in index households at the 30-day visit and remained low at the 90-day visit. However, parasite prevalence was not reduced to zero. Infections identified by qPCR persisted between study visits and were not identified by RDT. Parasites identified within the same household were most genetically related; however, overall parasite relatedness was low and similar across time and space. Thus, despite implementation of a reactive screen-and-treat program, parasitemia was not eliminated, and persisted in targeted households for at least 3 months.","60":"Toxoplasmosis is a prevalent protozoan infection with a complex lifecycle and wide profile of risk factors. The impact of congenital infection is well documented; however, there is increasing evidence of a much broader range of potential health outcomes and the need to improve our understanding of the transmission patterns and infection sources in the overall population. This study examined the epidemiology of toxoplasmosis in distinct community types from a highly endemic area of Chile.Crude seroprevalence was 55.9% (95% CI: 52.6-59.1%) with no difference by community type. Results are indicative of early exposure to the parasite, including 40% of 13- to 17-year olds who were already seropositive. Sociodemographic factors associated with seropositivity included age, occupations, and income. However, sex modified the effect of occupation as well as of income. Practices associated with increased seropositivity were consumption of sheep and locally produced vegetables as well as cleaning household barns or sheds. Boiling water for household use was a protective factor. Living on a sloped terrain without vegetation was a protective factor, while living in an area with high flow accumulation index was a risk factor.Seroprevalence of infection was high in both rural and urban slum communities with unique risk factor profiles for each community type. Findings highlight the role of the household and the community environment as influential factors in the epidemiology of the infection. Increasing awareness is needed at the health care and public health levels to establish disease burden and options for suitable control programs.A cross-sectional serosurvey was carried out in households from urban slums, rural villages, and farms which included collection of blood samples, as well as data on sociodemographic, behavioral, and spatial variables. Blood samples were analyzed for the presence of T. gondii-specific IgG antibodies. Avidity index was obtained for IgG-positive samples. Mixed-effects regression modeling was used to identify associations with relevant risk factors.","61":"Benzimidazole-derived ICT-based probe, DFPBEN is developed for trace level determination of water. In presence of water, the naked eye color of DFPBEN changes from red to yellow, while it turns to green from red under UV light. Upon addition of water, DFPBEN shows a ratiometric absorbance change in methanol.","62":"Aedes-borne viral diseases mainly Yellow Fever (YF), Dengue (DEN), Zika (ZIK) and Chikungunya (CHK) have contributed to many deaths' in the world especially in Africa. There have been major outbreaks of these diseases in West Africa. Although, YF outbreaks have occurred in Ghana over the years, no outbreak of DEN, ZIK and CHK has been recorded. However, the risk of outbreak is high due to its proximity to West African countries where outbreaks have been recently been recorded. This study surveyed the mosquito fauna to assess the risk of transmission of Yellow fever (YFV), Dengue (DENV), Chikungunya (CHKV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses in Larabanga and Mole Game Reserve areas in Northern Ghana. The immature and adult stages of Aedes mosquitoes were collected from Larabanga and Mole Game Reserve area. There was a significant (P>0.001) number of mosquitoes collected during the rainy season than the dry season. A total of 1,930 Aedes mosquitoes were collected during the rainy season and morphologically identified. Of these, 1,915 (99.22%) were Aedes aegypti and 15 (0.22%) were Aedes vittatus. During the dry season, 27 Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were collected. A total of 415 Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were molecularly identified to subspecies level of which Ae. (Ae) aegypti aegypti was the predominant subspecies. Both Ae. aegypti aegypti and Ae aegypti formosus exist in sympatry in the area. All Aedes pools (75) were negative for DENV, ZIKV and CHKV when examined by RT- PCR. Three Larval indices namely House Index, HI (percentage of houses positive for Aedes larvae or pupae), Container Index, CI (the percentage of containers positive for Aedes larvae or pupae) and Breteau Index, BI (number of positive containers per 100 houses inspected) were assessed as a measure for risk of transmission in the study area. The HI, CI and BI for both sites were as follows; Mole Game Reserve (HI, 42.1%, CI, 23.5% and BI, 100 for rainy season and 0 for all indices for dry season) and Larabanga (39%, 15.5% and 61 for rainy season and 2.3%, 1.3% and 2.3 for dry season). The spatial distribution of Aedes breeding sites in both areas indicated that Aedes larvae were breeding in areas with close proximity to humans. Lorry tires were the main source of Aedes larvae in all the study areas. Information about the species composition and the potential role of Aedes mosquitoes in future outbreaks of the diseases that they transmit is needed to design efficient surveillance and vector control tools.","63":" mosquitoes are considered secondary vectors. The objective of this systematic review is to characterize locations where OROV and\/or its primary vector have been detected. Synthesis of known data through review of published literature regarding OROV and vectors was carried out through two independent searches: one search targeted to OROV, and another targeted towards the primary vector. A total of 911 records were returned, but only 90 (9.9%) articles satisfied all inclusion criteria. When locations were characterized, some common features were noted more frequently than others, though no one characteristic was significantly associated with presence of OROV using a logistic classification model. In a separate correlation analysis, vector presence was significantly correlated only with the presence of restingas. The lack of significant relationships is likely due to the paucity of data regarding OROV and its eco-epidemiology and highlights the importance of continued focus on characterizing this and other neglected tropical diseases.","64":"A major challenge for microbiome studies is maintaining an even and accurate DNA extraction in the presence of samples with a wide range of bacterial content. Here we compare five DNA extraction methods using replicate stool samples that were diluted to create high and low biomass samples. Our results indicate greater variation in microbiome composition between high and low biomass samples than variation between methods. Many of the extraction methods had reduced yield from low biomass samples; however, our adapted plate column-based extraction method was evenly efficient and captured the largest number of high-quality reads. Based on these results, we have identified a DNA extraction method that ensures adequate yield in metagenomic microbiome studies that have samples with a broad range of\u00a0bacterial content.","65":"We provide a data-driven method for optimizing pharmacy-based distribution of antiviral drugs during an influenza pandemic in terms of overall access for a target population and apply it to the state of Texas, USA. We found that during the 2009 influenza pandemic, the Texas Department of State Health Services achieved an estimated statewide access of 88% (proportion of population willing to travel to the nearest dispensing point). However, access reached only 34.5% of US postal code (ZIP code) areas containing <1,000 underinsured persons. Optimized distribution networks increased expected access to 91% overall and 60% in hard-to-reach regions, and 2 or 3 major pharmacy chains achieved near maximal coverage in well-populated areas. Independent pharmacies were essential for reaching ZIP code areas containing <1,000 underinsured persons. This model was developed during a collaboration between academic researchers and public health officials and is available as a decision support tool for Texas Department of State Health Services at a Web-based interface. ","66":"We conducted a cross-sectional study at the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust between 16 April 2019 and 8 November 2022. We recruited consecutive PWH, who were attending a routine follow-up outpatient appointment and were prescribed at least one medication for CVD. In addition, we included urinary adherence results of patients with samples collected as part of routine clinical care. We used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) to assess if their prescribed medications (antihypertensives, diuretics, beta-blockers, lipid-lowering agents, antiplatelets, anticoagulants, antidiabetic medications) were present in the participant's urine sample. Multivariable models were used to identify demographic or clinical features that were associated with non-adherence.A total of 162 PWH were included in the analysis. Median age was 55 [interquartile range (IQR): 50-61] years, 63% were male, average time living with HIV was 15\u2009years (IQR: 11-19) and the majority (98%) had an undetectable HIV viral load. In approximately one-third of patients (59\/162), at least one prescribed medication of interest was not detected in urine. Non-adherence to lipid-lowering agents was common (35\/88, 40%). On multivariable logistic regression, the number of prescribed cardiovascular medications, was associated with medication non-adherence [medication non-adherence, per one medication increase: adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) =\u20091.78 (1.34-2.36); p\u2009<\u20090.001].We found sub-optimal adherence to medications for CVD in PWH. In order to maximize the clinical benefit of statin therapy in PWH, factors requiring consideration include: improved medication adherence, awareness of polypharmacy, educational interventions and quantitative assessment of sub-optimal adherence through chemical adherence testing.People with HIV (PWH) are at an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to HIV-negative individuals. We sought to evaluate the adherence to medications for CVD in PWH and identify factors associated with non-adherence to these medications.","67":"Viruses and their hosts can undergo coevolutionary arms races where hosts evolve increased resistance and viruses evolve counter-resistance. Given these arms race dynamics (ARD), both players are predicted to evolve along a single trajectory as more recently evolved genotypes replace their predecessors. By coupling phenotypic and genomic analyses of coevolving populations of bacteriophage \u03bb and Escherichia coli, we find conflicting evidence for ARD. Virus-host infection phenotypes fit the ARD model, yet genomic analyses revealed fluctuating selection dynamics. Rather than coevolution unfolding along a single trajectory, cryptic genetic variation emerges and is maintained at low frequency for generations until it eventually supplants dominant lineages. These observations suggest a hybrid 'leapfrog' dynamic, revealing weaknesses in the predictive power of standard coevolutionary models. The findings shed light on the mechanisms that structure coevolving ecological networks and reveal the limits of using phenotypic or genomic data alone to differentiate coevolutionary dynamics.","68":"Higher anti-RBD antibodies in patients were associated with protection against symptomatic COVID-19 during emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants.A total of 662 (33%) of 2,018 symptomatic patients tested positive for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the Omicron-predominant period, geometric mean anti-RBD binding antibody concentrations measured 823 BAU\/mL (95%CI:690-981) among COVID-19 case-patients versus 1,189 BAU\/mL (95%CI:1,050-1,347) among SARS-CoV-2 test-negative patients. In the adjusted logistic regression, increasing levels of anti-RBD antibodies were associated with reduced odds of COVID-19 for both Delta and Omicron infections.From October 2021-June 2022, study sites in seven states enrolled and tested respiratory specimens from patients of all ages presenting with acute respiratory illness for SARS-CoV-2 infection using rRT-PCR. In blood specimens, we measured concentration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against the ancestral strain spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (N) antigens in standardized binding antibody units (BAU\/mL). Percent reduction in odds of symptomatic COVID-19 by anti-RBD antibody was estimated using logistic regression modeled as (1-adjusted odds ratio of COVID-19)\u00d7100, adjusting for COVID-19 vaccination status, age, site, and high-risk exposure.We assessed the association between antibody concentration \u22645 days of symptom onset and COVID-19 illness among patients enrolled in a test-negative study.","69":"The early COVID-19 pandemic was characterized by rapid global spread. In Maryland and Washington, DC, United States, more than 2500 cases were reported within 3 weeks of the first COVID-19 detection in March 2020. We aimed to use genomic sequencing to understand the initial spread of SARS-CoV-2 - the virus that causes COVID-19 - in the region. We analyzed 620 samples collected from the Johns Hopkins Health System during March 11-31, 2020, comprising 28.6% of the total cases in Maryland and Washington, DC. From these samples, we generated 114 complete viral genomes. Analysis of these genomes alongside a subsampling of over 1000 previously published sequences showed that the diversity in this region rivaled global SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity at that time and that the sequences belong to all of the major globally circulating lineages, suggesting multiple introductions into the region. We also analyzed these regional SARS-CoV-2 genomes alongside detailed clinical metadata and found that clinically severe cases had viral genomes belonging to all major viral lineages. We conclude that efforts to control local spread of the virus were likely confounded by the number of introductions into the region early in the epidemic and the interconnectedness of the region as a whole.","70":"Mathematical models are used to gauge the impact of interventions for healthcare-associated infections. As with any analytic method, such models require many assumptions. Two common assumptions are that asymptomatically colonized individuals are more likely to be hospitalized and that they spend longer in the hospital per admission because of their colonization status. These assumptions have no biological basis and could impact the estimated effects of interventions in unintended ways. Therefore, we developed a model of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus transmission to explicitly evaluate the impact of these assumptions. We found that assuming that asymptomatically colonized individuals were more likely to be admitted to the hospital or spend longer in the hospital than uncolonized individuals biased results compared to a more realistic model that did not make either assumption. Results were heavily biased when estimating the impact of an intervention that directly reduced transmission in a hospital. In contrast, results were moderately biased when estimating the impact of an intervention that decolonized hospital patients. Our findings can inform choices modelers face when constructing models of healthcare-associated infection interventions and thereby improve their validity.","71":"The many respiratory viruses that cause influenza-like illness (ILI) are reported and tracked as one entity, defined by the CDC as a group of symptoms that include a fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a cough, and\/or a sore throat. In the United States alone, ILI impacts 9-49 million people every year. While tracking ILI assingle clinical syndrome is informative in many respects, the underlying viruses differ in parameters and outbreak properties. Most existing models treat either a single respiratory virus or ILI as a whole. However, there is a need for models capable of comparing several individual viruses that cause respiratory illness, including ILI. To address this need, here we present a flexible model and simulations of epidemics for influenza, RSV, rhinovirus, seasonal coronavirus, adenovirus, and SARS\/MERS, parameterized by a systematic literature review and accompanied by a global sensitivity analysis. We find that for these biological causes of ILI, their parameter values, timing, prevalence, and proportional contributions differ substantially. These results demonstrate that distinguishing the viruses that cause ILI will be an important aspect of future work on diagnostics, mitigation, modeling, and preparation for future pandemics.","72":"Drug resistance mutations appear in HIV under treatment pressure. Resistant variants can be transmitted to treatment-naive individuals, which can lead to rapid virological failure and can limit treatment options. Consequently, quantifying the prevalence, emergence and transmission of drug resistance is critical to effectively treating patients and to shape health policies. We review recent bioinformatics developments and in particular describe: (1) the machine learning approaches intended to predict and explain the level of resistance of HIV variants from their sequence data; (2) the phylogenetic methods used to survey the emergence and dynamics of resistant HIV transmission clusters; (3) the impact of deep sequencing in studying within-host and between-host genetic diversity of HIV variants, notably regarding minority resistant variants.","73":"The COVID-19 pandemic is marked by the successive emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, lineages, and sublineages that outcompete earlier strains, largely due to factors like increased transmissibility and immune escape. We propose DeepAutoCoV, an unsupervised deep learning anomaly detection system, to predict future dominant lineages (FDLs). We define FDLs as viral (sub)lineages that will constitute >10% of all the viral sequences added to the GISAID, a public database supporting viral genetic sequence sharing, in a given week. DeepAutoCoV is trained and validated by assembling global and country-specific data sets from over 16 million Spike protein sequences sampled over a period of ~4\u00a0years. DeepAutoCoV successfully flags FDLs at very low frequencies (0.01%-3%), with median lead times of 4-17\u00a0weeks, and predicts FDLs between ~5 and\u2009~25 times better than a baseline approach. For example, the B.1.617.2 vaccine reference strain was flagged as FDL when its frequency was only 0.01%, more than a year before it was considered for an updated COVID-19 vaccine. Furthermore, DeepAutoCoV outputs interpretable results by pinpointing specific mutations potentially linked to increased fitness and may provide significant insights for the optimization of public health 'pre-emptive' intervention strategies.","74":"=5 and a vaccine coverage of 70-80-90% among 12-17, 18-59, and \u2265 60 years old, important stress on healthcare is expected in the absence of measures. Unvaccinated adults \u226560 years old represent 3% of the population but 43% of hospitalizations. Given limited vaccine coverage, children aged 0-17 years old represent a third of infections and are responsible for almost half of transmissions. Unvaccinated individuals have a disproportionate contribution to transmission so that measures targeting them may help maximize epidemic control while minimizing costs for society compared to non-targeted approaches. Of all the interventions considered including repeated testing and non-pharmaceutical measures, vaccination of the unvaccinated is the most effective.We used an age-stratified compartmental model calibrated to French data to anticipate these changes and determine implications for the control of an autumn epidemic. We assumed vaccines reduce the risk of hospitalization, infection, and transmission if infected by 95%, 60%, and 50%, respectively.With the Delta variant, vaccinated individuals are well protected against hospitalization but remain at risk of infection and should therefore apply protective behaviors (e.g., mask-wearing). Targeting non-vaccinated individuals may maximize epidemic control while minimizing costs for society. Vaccinating children protects them from the deleterious effects of non-pharmaceutical measures. Control strategies should account for the changing SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology.Vaccination is expected to change the epidemiology and management of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.","75":"We calibrated a deterministic mathematical model to the Dutch HCV epidemic among HIV-infected MSM to compare three different DAA treatment scenarios: 1) immediate treatment, 2) treatment delayed to chronic infection allowing spontaneous clearance to occur, 3) treatment delayed until F2 fibrosis stage. All scenarios are simulated from 2015 onwards. Total costs, quality adjusted life years (QALY), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and epidemiological impact were calculated from a providers perspective over a lifetime horizon. We used a DAA price of \u20ac35,000 and 3% discounting rates for cost and QALYs.Early DAA treatment for HIV-infected MSM is an excellent and sustainable tool to meet the WHO goal of eliminating HCV in 2030.Immediate DAA treatment lowers the incidence from 1.2\/100 person-years to 0.2\/100 person-years (interquartile range 0.1-0.2) and the prevalence from 5.0\/100 person-years to 0.5\/100 person-years (0.4-0.6) after 20 years. Delayed treatment awaiting spontaneous clearance will result in a similar reduction. However, further delayed treatment to F2 will increases the incidence and prevalence. Earlier treatment will cost society \u20ac68.3 and \u20ac75.1 million over a lifetime for immediate and awaiting until the chronic stage, respectively. The cost will increase if treatment is further delayed until F2 to \u20ac98.4 million. Immediate treatment will prevent 7070 new infections and gains 3419 (3019-3854) QALYs compared to F2 treatment resulting in a cost saving ICER. Treatment in the chronic stage is however dominated.Treatment of hepatitis C virus infections (HCV) with direct acting antivirals (DAA) can prevent new infections since cured individuals cannot transmit HCV. However, as DAAs are expensive, many countries defer treatment to advances stages of fibrosis, which results in ongoing transmission. We assessed the epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of treatment initiation in different stages of infection in the Netherlands where the epidemic is mainly concentrated among HIV-infected MSMs.","76":"Zoonotic avian influenza poses a major risk to China, and other parts of the world. H5N1 has remained endemic in China and globally for nearly two decades, and in 2013, a novel zoonotic influenza A subtype H7N9 emerged in China. This study aimed to improve upon our current understanding of the spreading mechanisms of H7N9 and H5N1 by generating spatial risk profiles for each of the two virus subtypes across mainland China.In this study, we (i) developed a refined data set of H5N1 and H7N9 locations with consideration of animal\/animal environment case data, as well as spatial accuracy and precision; (ii) used this data set along with environmental variables to build species distribution models (SDMs) for each virus subtype in high resolution spatial units of 1km2 cells using Maxent; (iii) developed a risk modelling framework which integrated the results from the SDMs with human and chicken population variables, which was done to quantify the risk of zoonotic transmission; and (iv) identified areas at high risk of H5N1 and H7N9 transmission. We produced high performing SDMs (6 of 8 models with AUC > 0.9) for both H5N1 and H7N9. In all our SDMs, H7N9 consistently showed higher AUC results compared to H5N1, suggesting H7N9 suitability could be better explained by environmental variables. For both subtypes, high risk areas were primarily located in south-eastern China, with H5N1 distributions found to be more diffuse and extending more inland compared to H7N9.We provide projections of our risk models to public health policy makers so that specific high risk areas can be targeted for control measures. We recommend comparing H5N1 and H7N9 prevalence rates and survivability in the natural environment to better understand the role of animal and environmental transmission in human infections.","77":"Measles virus is directly responsible for more than 100,000 deaths yearly. Epidemiological studies have associated measles with increased morbidity and mortality for years after infection, but the reasons why are poorly understood. Measles virus infects immune cells, causing acute immune suppression. To identify and quantify long-term effects of measles on the immune system, we used VirScan, an assay that tracks antibodies to thousands of pathogen epitopes in blood. We studied 77 unvaccinated children before and 2 months after natural measles virus infection. Measles caused elimination of 11 to 73% of the antibody repertoire across individuals. Recovery of antibodies was detected after natural reexposure to pathogens. Notably, these immune system effects were not observed in infants vaccinated against MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), but were confirmed in measles-infected macaques. The reduction in humoral immune memory after measles infection generates potential vulnerability to future infections, underscoring the need for widespread vaccination.","78":"On March 11, 2020, Italy imposed a national lockdown to curtail the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. We estimate that, 14 days after lockdown, the net reproduction number had dropped below 1 and remained stable at \u00bb0.76 (95% CI 0.67-0.85) in all regions for >3 of the following weeks.","79":"The relationship between the inoculum dose and the ability of the pathogen to invade the host is poorly understood. Experimental studies in non-human primates infected with different inoculum doses of hepatitis B virus have shown a non-monotonic relationship between dose magnitude and infection outcome, with high and low doses leading to 100% liver infection and intermediate doses leading to less than 0.1% liver infection, corresponding to CD4 T-cell priming. Since hepatitis B clearance is CD8 T-cell mediated, the question of whether the inoculum dose influences CD8 T-cell dynamics arises. To help answer this question, we developed a mathematical model of virus-host interaction following hepatitis B virus infection. Our model explains the experimental data well, and predicts that the inoculum dose affects both the timing of the CD8 T-cell expansion and the quality of its response, especially the non-cytotoxic function. We find that a low-dose challenge leads to slow CD8 T-cell expansion, weak non-cytotoxic functions, and virus persistence; high- and medium-dose challenges lead to fast CD8 T-cell expansion, strong cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic function, and virus clearance; while a super-low-dose challenge leads to delayed CD8 T-cell expansion, strong cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic function, and virus clearance. These results are useful for designing immune cell-based interventions.","80":"More information about the analysis, as well as access to data and code is available at https:\/\/github.com\/fhdsl\/ITCR_Metrics_manuscript_website.To understand how software developers evaluate their tools, we conducted a survey of participants in the Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) program funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). We found that although developers realize the value of more extensive metric collection, they find a lack of funding and time hindering. We also investigated software among this community for how often infrastructure that supports more nontraditional metrics were implemented and how this impacted rates of papers describing usage of the software. We found that infrastructure such as social media presence, more in-depth documentation, the presence of software health metrics, and clear information on how to contact developers seemed to be associated with increased mention rates. Analyzing more diverse metrics can enable developers to better understand user engagement, justify continued funding, identify novel use cases, pinpoint improvement areas, and ultimately amplify their software's impact. Challenges are associated, including distorted or misleading metrics, as well as ethical and security concerns. More attention to nuances involved in capturing impact across the spectrum of biomedical software is needed. For funders and developers, we outline guidance based on experience from our community. By considering how we evaluate software, we can empower developers to create tools that more effectively accelerate biological and medical research progress.Supplementary Information are available at Bioinformatics online.Software is vital for the advancement of biology and medicine. Impact evaluations of scientific software have primarily emphasized traditional citation metrics of associated papers, despite these metrics inadequately capturing the dynamic picture of impact and despite challenges with improper citation.","81":"Participants wore EHMRs typically 1-3 hours per shift, reported disinfecting the respirator after 85% of removals, and reported high confidence in using the EHMR following the study. EHMRs caused minimal interference with patient care tasks, though they did inhibit communication.This study highlights the feasibility of deployment of EHMRs during a public health emergency when an alternative respirator option is necessary.During public health emergencies, demand for N95\u00ae filtering facepiece respirators (N95 FFRs) can outpace supply. Elastomeric half mask respirators (EHMRs) are a potential alternative that are reusable and provide the same or higher levels of protection. This study sought to examine the practical aspects of EHMR use among healthcare personnel (HCP).Between September and December 2021, 183 HCP at two tertiary referral centers participated in this three-month EHMR deployment, wearing the EHMR whenever respiratory protection was required according to hospital protocols (i.e., when an N95 FFR would typically be worn) and responding to surveys about their experience.HCP who had not previously worn an EHMR were able to wear it as an alternative to an N95 FFR without much reported interference with their job tasks and with high disinfection compliance.","82":"Viruses and their host genomes often share similar oligonucleotide frequency (ONF) patterns, which can be used to predict the host of a given virus by finding the host with the greatest ONF similarity. We comprehensively compared 11 ONF metrics using several k-mer lengths for predicting host taxonomy from among \u223c32 000 prokaryotic genomes for 1427 virus isolate genomes whose true hosts are known. The background-subtracting measure [Formula: see text] at k = 6 gave the highest host prediction accuracy (33%, genus level) with reasonable computational times. Requiring a maximum dissimilarity score for making predictions (thresholding) and taking the consensus of the 30 most similar hosts further improved accuracy. Using a previous dataset of 820 bacteriophage and 2699 bacterial genomes, [Formula: see text] host prediction accuracies with thresholding and consensus methods (genus-level: 64%) exceeded previous Euclidian distance ONF (32%) or homology-based (22-62%) methods. When applied to metagenomically-assembled marine SUP05 viruses and the human gut virus crAssphage, [Formula: see text]-based predictions overlapped (i.e. some same, some different) with the previously inferred hosts of these viruses. The extent of overlap improved when only using host genomes or metagenomic contigs from the same habitat or samples as the query viruses. The [Formula: see text] ONF method will greatly improve the characterization of novel, metagenomic viruses.","83":"Development of strategies for mitigating the severity of COVID-19 is now a top public health priority. We sought to assess strategies for mitigating the COVID-19 outbreak in a hospital setting via the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions. We developed an individual-based model for COVID-19 transmission in a hospital setting. We calibrated the model using data of a COVID-19 outbreak in a hospital unit in Wuhan. The calibrated model was used to simulate different intervention scenarios and estimate the impact of different interventions on outbreak size and workday loss. The use of high-efficacy facial masks was shown to be able to reduce infection cases and workday loss by 80% (90% credible interval (CrI): 73.1-85.7%) and 87% (CrI: 80.0-92.5%), respectively. The use of social distancing alone, through reduced contacts between healthcare workers, had a marginal impact on the outbreak. Our results also indicated that a quarantine policy should be coupled with other interventions to achieve its effect. The effectiveness of all these interventions was shown to increase with their early implementation. Our analysis shows that a COVID-19 outbreak in a hospital's non-COVID-19 unit can be controlled or mitigated by the use of existing non-pharmaceutical measures.","84":"We found that 21% of admissions (n = 2194) were placed on contact precautions, with most for MRSA and VRE. We found little evidence that contact precautions reduced MRSA transmission. The estimated change in transmission attributed to contact precautions was -16% (95% credible interval, -38% to 15%). VRE transmission was higher than MRSA transmission due to contact precautions, but not significantly. In our meta-regression, we did not identify associations between ICU-level factors and estimated contact precaution effects. Importation and transmission were higher for VRE than for MRSA, but clearance rates were lower for VRE than for MRSA.We retrospectively analyzed data from the Strategies to Reduce Transmission of Antimicrobial Resistant Bacteria in Intensive Care Units (STAR*ICU) trial to model the use of contact precautions in individual intensive care units (ICUs). Data included admission and discharge times and surveillance test results. We used a transmission model to estimate key epidemiological parameters, including the effect of contact precautions on transmission. Finally, we performed multivariate meta-regression to identify ICU-level factors associated with contact precaution effects.Contact precautions for endemic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are under increasing scrutiny, in part due to limited clinical trial evidence.We found little evidence that contact precautions implemented during the STAR*ICU trial reduced transmission of MRSA or VRE. We did find important differences in the transmission dynamics between MRSA and VRE. Differences in organism and healthcare setting may impact the efficacy of contact precautions.","85":"Drug- and alcohol-poisoning deaths remain current public health problems. Studies to date have typically focused on individual-level predictors of drug overdose deaths, and there remains a limited understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns and predictors of the joint outcomes. We use a hierarchical Bayesian spatiotemporal multivariate Poisson regression model on data from (N\u202f=\u202f167) ZIP-codes between 2009 and 2014 in New York City to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of the joint occurrence of drug (opioids) and alcohol-poisoning deaths, and the covariates associated with each outcome. Results indicate that rates of both outcomes were highly positively correlated across ZIP-codes (cross-correlation: 0.57, 95% credible interval (CrI): 0.29, 0.77). ZIP-codes with a higher prevalence of heavy drinking had higher alcohol-poisoning deaths (relative risk (RR):1.63, 95% CrI: 1.26, 2.05) and drug-poisoning deaths (RR: 1.29, 95% CrI: 1.03, 1.59). These spatial patterns may guide public health planners to target specific areas to address these co-occurring epidemics.","86":"Few studies have quantified social mixing in remote rural areas of developing countries, where the burden of infectious diseases is usually the highest. Understanding social mixing patterns in those settings is crucial to inform the implementation of strategies for disease prevention and control. We characterized contact and social mixing patterns in rural communities of the Peruvian highlands.This cross-sectional study was nested in a large prospective household-based study of respiratory infections conducted in the province of San Marcos, Cajamarca-Peru. Members of study households were interviewed using a structured questionnaire of social contacts (conversation or physical interaction) experienced during the last 24 hours. We identified 9015 reported contacts from 588 study household members. The median age of respondents was 17 years (interquartile range [IQR] 4-34 years). The median number of reported contacts was 12 (IQR 8-20) whereas the median number of physical (i.e. skin-to-skin) contacts was 8.5 (IQR 5-14). Study participants had contacts mostly with people of similar age, and with their offspring or parents. The number of reported contacts was mainly determined by the participants' age, household size and occupation. School-aged children had more contacts than other age groups. Within-household reciprocity of contacts reporting declined with household size (range 70%-100%). Ninety percent of household contact networks were complete, and furthermore, household members' contacts with non-household members showed significant overlap (range 33%-86%), indicating a high degree of contact clustering. A two-level mixing epidemic model was simulated to compare within-household mixing based on observed contact networks and within-household random mixing. No differences in the size or duration of the simulated epidemics were revealed.This study of rural low-density communities in the highlands of Peru suggests contact patterns are highly assortative. Study findings support the use of within-household homogenous mixing assumptions for epidemic modeling in this setting.","87":"In line with previous instalments of analysis from this ongoing study to monitor 'Covid Seroprevalence' among blood donors in South Africa, we report on an analysis of 3395 samples obtained in mid-March 2022 from all provinces of South Africa - a timepoint just after the fourth (primarily omicron) wave of infections. As in our previous analyses, we see no evidence of age and sex dependence of prevalence, but significant variation by race. Differences between provinces have largely disappeared, as prevalence appears to have saturated. In contrast to previous estimates from this study, which reported only prevalence of anti-nucleocapsid antibodies, this present work also reports results from testing for anti-spike antibodies. This addition allows us to categorise those donors whose only antibodies are from vaccination. Our race-weighted national extrapolation is that 98% of South Africans have some antibodies, noting that 10% have anti-spike antibodies but not anti-nucleocapsid antibodies - a reasonable proxy for having both 1) been vaccinated and 2) avoided infection.","88":"In March 2020 the South African COVID-19 Modelling Consortium was formed to support government planning for COVID-19 cases and related healthcare. Models were developed jointly by local disease modelling groups to estimate cases, resource needs and deaths due to COVID-19. The National COVID-19 Epi Model (NCEM) while initially developed as a deterministic compartmental model of SARS-Cov-2 transmission in the nine provinces of South Africa, was adapted several times over the course of the first wave of infection in response to emerging local data and changing needs of government. By the end of the first wave, the NCEM had developed into a stochastic, spatially-explicit compartmental transmission model to estimate the total and reported incidence of COVID-19 across the 52 districts of South Africa. The model adopted a generalised Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed structure that accounted for the clinical profile of SARS-COV-2 (asymptomatic, mild, severe and critical cases) and avenues of treatment access (outpatient, and hospitalisation in non-ICU and ICU wards). Between end-March and early September 2020, the model was updated 11 times with four key releases to generate new sets of projections and scenario analyses to be shared with planners in the national and provincial Departments of Health, the National Treasury and other partners. Updates to model structure included finer spatial granularity, limited access to treatment, and the inclusion of behavioural heterogeneity in relation to the adoption of Public Health and Social Measures. These updates were made in response to local data and knowledge and the changing needs of the planners. The NCEM attempted to incorporate a high level of local data to contextualise the model appropriately to address South Africa's population and health system characteristics that played a vital role in producing and updating estimates of resource needs, demonstrating the importance of harnessing and developing local modelling capacity.","89":". 12.4, P=0.018). NPO duration was also associated with increased age (r=0.041, P=0.027) and inversely related to hospital occupancy (r=-0.08, P<0.0001). There were no statistically significant associations with provider type, hospital location or service, length of stay, and total number of comorbidities.Inpatient data from 2016-2018 for the three procedures was extracted from electronic medical records and administrative data at a single-center tertiary academic medical center. Various statistical tests (Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon, Pearson) were employed depending on the outcome type and data distribution.NPO times for common inpatient gastroenterology (GI) procedures generally exceeded 12 hours, suggesting there is an opportunity to adopt changes to decrease NPO duration for low-risk patients while maintaining adherence to guidelines and best practice.Gastrointestinal procedures generally require pre-procedural fasting to optimize sedation safety. While the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) recommends no intake of clear liquids and solid food 2-4 and 6-8 hours respectively prior to endoscopic procedures, the actual nil per os (NPO) duration for these procedures in practice is unknown. Our objective was to analyze NPO duration for patients undergoing these procedures and to determine its association with clinical and administrative variables.","90":"Large Phase III trials across Asia and Latin America have recently demonstrated the efficacy of a recombinant, live-attenuated dengue vaccine (Dengvaxia) over the first 25 mo following vaccination. Subsequent data collected in the longer-term follow-up phase, however, have raised concerns about a potential increase in hospitalization risk of subsequent dengue infections, in particular among young, dengue-na\u00efve vaccinees. We here report predictions from eight independent modelling groups on the long-term safety, public health impact, and cost-effectiveness of routine vaccination with Dengvaxia in a range of transmission settings, as characterised by seroprevalence levels among 9-y-olds (SP9). These predictions were conducted for the World Health Organization to inform their recommendations on optimal use of this vaccine.Dengvaxia has the potential to reduce the burden of dengue disease in areas of moderate to high dengue endemicity. However, the potential risks of vaccination in areas with limited exposure to dengue as well as the local costs and benefits of routine vaccination are important considerations for the inclusion of Dengvaxia into existing immunisation programmes. These results were important inputs into WHO global policy for use of this licensed dengue vaccine.The models adopted, with small variations, a parsimonious vaccine mode of action that was able to reproduce quantitative features of the observed trial data. The adopted mode of action assumed that vaccination, similarly to natural infection, induces transient, heterologous protection and, further, establishes a long-lasting immunogenic memory, which determines disease severity of subsequent infections. The default vaccination policy considered was routine vaccination of 9-y-old children in a three-dose schedule at 80% coverage. The outcomes examined were the impact of vaccination on infections, symptomatic dengue, hospitalised dengue, deaths, and cost-effectiveness over a 30-y postvaccination period. Case definitions were chosen in accordance with the Phase III trials. All models predicted that in settings with moderate to high dengue endemicity (SP9 \u2265 50%), the default vaccination policy would reduce the burden of dengue disease for the population by 6%-25% (all simulations: -3%-34%) and in high-transmission settings (SP9 \u2265 70%) by 13%-25% (all simulations: 10%- 34%). These endemicity levels are representative of the participating sites in both Phase III trials. In contrast, in settings with low transmission intensity (SP9 \u2264 30%), the models predicted that vaccination could lead to a substantial increase in hospitalisation because of dengue. Modelling reduced vaccine coverage or the addition of catch-up campaigns showed that the impact of vaccination scaled approximately linearly with the number of people vaccinated. In assessing the optimal age of vaccination, we found that targeting older children could increase the net benefit of vaccination in settings with moderate transmission intensity (SP9 = 50%). Overall, vaccination was predicted to be potentially cost-effective in most endemic settings if priced competitively. The results are based on the assumption that the vaccine acts similarly to natural infection. This assumption is consistent with the available trial results but cannot be directly validated in the absence of additional data. Furthermore, uncertainties remain regarding the level of protection provided against disease versus infection and the rate at which vaccine-induced protection declines.","91":"A key drawback to monitoring the emergence and spread of antimalarial drug resistance in sub-Saharan Africa is early detection and containment. Next-generation sequencing methods offer the resolution, sensitivity, and scale required to fill this gap by surveilling for molecular markers of drug resistance. We performed targeted sequencing using molecular inversion probes to interrogate five Plasmodium falciparum genes (pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhps, pfdhfr, and pfk13) implicated in chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), and artemisinin resistance in two sites in Ghana. A total of 803 dried blood spots from children aged between 6\u2009months and 14\u2009years presenting with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria at the Begoro District Hospital in Begoro and the Ewim Polyclinic in Cape Coast, Ghana, from 2014 to 2017 were prepared on filter paper. Thirteen years after the removal of drug pressure, chloroquine-sensitive parasite strains with pfcrt K76 have increased nearly to fixation in Begoro, in the forest area (prevalence\u2009=\u200995%), but at a lower rate in Cape Coast, in the coastal region (prevalence\u2009=\u200971%, Z = -3.5, P\u2009<\u20090.001). In addition, pfmdr1 184F-bearing parasites are under strong selection. The pfdhfr\/pfdhps quadruple genotype ( IRNG K), associated with SP resistance, is near saturation. Our study identified at a 2 to 10% prevalence pfdhps 581G, which is a sulfadoxine resistance marker that correlates with the failure of SP prophylaxis in pregnancy and which has not been observed in Ghana. The differences in the reexpansion of chloroquine-sensitive strains observed at the two study sites, the stronger SP resistance, and the high prevalence of pfmdr1 184F should be further monitored to inform malaria control strategies in Ghana.","92":"Host population demographics and patterns of host-to-host interactions are important drivers of heterogeneity in infectious disease transmission. To improve our understanding of how population structures and changes therein influence disease transmission dynamics at the individual and population level, we model a dynamic age- and household-structured population using longitudinal microdata drawn from Belgian census and population registers. At different points in time, we simulate the spread of a close-contact infectious disease and vary the age profiles of infectiousness and susceptibility to reflect specific infections (e.g. influenza and SARS-CoV-2) using a two-level mixing model, which distinguishes between exposure to infection in the household and exposure in the community. We find that the strong relationship between age and household structures, in combination with social mixing patterns and epidemiological parameters, shape the spread of an emerging infection. Disease transmission in the adult population in particular is to a large degree explained by differential household compositions and not just household size. Moreover, we highlight how demographic processes alter population structures in an ageing population and how these in turn affect disease transmission dynamics across population groups.","93":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major and growing public health concern. We need to know the expected health burden and treatment cost, and understand uncertainty in those estimates, to inform policymaking and future research. Two models that have been important in informing treatment guidelines and assessments of HCV burden were compared by simulating cohorts of individuals with chronic HCV infection initially aged 20, 35 and 50\u00a0years. One model predicts that health losses (measured in quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) and treatment costs decrease with increasing initial age of the patients, whilst the other model predicts that below 40\u00a0years, costs increase and QALY losses change little with age, and above 40\u00a0years, they decline with increasing age. Average per-patient costs differ between the models by up to 38%, depending on the patients' initial age. One model predicts double the total number, and triple the peak annual incidence, of liver transplants compared to the other model. One model predicts 55%-314% more deaths than the other, depending on the patients' initial age. The main sources of difference between the models are estimated progression rates between disease states and rates of health service utilization associated with different disease states and, in particular, the age dependency of these parameters. We conclude that decision-makers need to be aware that uncertainties in the health burden and economic cost of HCV disease have important consequences for predictions of future need for care and cost-effectiveness of interventions to avert HCV transmission, and further quantification is required to inform decisions.","94":"Multiple factors, including climate change, dispersal barriers, and social behavior influence the genetic structure of natural populations. While the effects of extrinsic factors such as historical climatic change and habitat topography have been well studied, mostly in temperate habitats, the simultaneous effects of intrinsic factors such as social behavior on genetic structure have rarely been explored. Such simultaneous effect, however, may particularly be common in social mammals such as many primates. Consequently, we studied the population structure of a rare and endangered social primate, the Arunachal macaque Macaca munzala , endemic to the northeastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, located on the subtropical southern edge of the Tibetan Plateau and forming part of the Eastern Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. We studied a 534\u2009bp\u2010long mitochondrial DNA sequence and 22 autosomal microsatellite loci in individuals from three populations, Tawang, Upper Subansiri, and West Siang. The mtDNA data revealed three major divergence events: that between the Arunachal and bonnet macaques (ca. 1.61\u2009mya), the founding of the West Siang population and the ancestral population of the present\u2010day bonnet macaques (ca. 1.32\u2009mya), and the divergence between the Tawang and Upper Subansiri populations (ca. 0.80\u2009mya) that coincided with the major glacial events in the region. Comparing mitochondrial DNA with autosomal microsatellites, we also found evidence for female philopatry and male\u2010driven long\u2010distance gene flow. Arunachal macaques thus appear to be characterized by groups of philopatric females separated by geographical barriers and harsh climate but with dispersing males exerting a homogenizing effect on the nuclear gene pool. Given that severe population differentiation is of major concern in species conservation, we suggest that our study populations represent significant conservation units of this rare, endangered primate but, more importantly, emphasize the complex interplay of extrinsic and intrinsic factors in shaping the population structure of a social mammalian species.","95":"There exists significant interest in developing statistical and computational tools for inferring 'who infected whom' in an infectious disease outbreak from densely sampled case data, with most recent studies focusing on the analysis of whole genome sequence data. However, genomic data can be poorly informative of transmission events if mutations accumulate too slowly to resolve individual transmission pairs or if there exist multiple pathogens lineages within-host, and there has been little focus on incorporating other types of outbreak data. We present here a methodology that uses contact data for the inference of transmission trees in a statistically rigorous manner, alongside genomic data and temporal data. Contact data is frequently collected in outbreaks of pathogens spread by close contact, including Ebola virus (EBOV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), and routinely used to reconstruct transmission chains. As an improvement over previous, ad-hoc approaches, we developed a probabilistic model that relates a set of contact data to an underlying transmission tree and integrated this in the outbreaker2 inference framework. By analyzing simulated outbreaks under various contact tracing scenarios, we demonstrate that contact data significantly improves our ability to reconstruct transmission trees, even under realistic limitations on the coverage of the contact tracing effort and the amount of non-infectious mixing between cases. Indeed, contact data is equally or more informative than fully sampled whole genome sequence data in certain scenarios. We then use our method to analyze the early stages of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore and describe the range of transmission scenarios consistent with contact data and genetic sequence in a probabilistic manner for the first time. This simple yet flexible model can easily be incorporated into existing tools for outbreak reconstruction and should permit a better integration of genomic and epidemiological data for inferring transmission chains.","96":"Overall pre-vaccination seropositivity was high and just over half of the cohort seroconverted to\u00a0\u2265\u00a01 vaccine antigen. Antibody responses were highest among participants with lower pre-vaccination titers. Among older adults with high pre-existing antibody titers, approaches to improve immune responses are needed.Immune responses to influenza vaccination tend to be lower among older, frequently vaccinated adults. Use of egg-free influenza vaccines is increasing, but limited data exist on factors associated with their immunogenicity in older adults.Among 91 participants who received egg-free influenza vaccines, 84 (92.3\u00a0%) received quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok, Sanofi Pasteur), and 7 (7.7\u00a0%) received quadrivalent cell culture-based influenza vaccine (ccIIV4, Flucelvax, Seqirus). Pre-vaccination seropositivity was 52.8\u00a0% for A(H1N1), 94.5\u00a0% for A(H3N2), 61.5\u00a0% for B\/Colorado and 48.4\u00a0% for B\/Phuket. Seroconversion by antigen ranged from 16.5\u00a0% for A(H1N1) and B\/Colorado to 37.4\u00a0% for A(H3N2); 40 participants failed to seroconvert to any antigen. Factors independently associated with higher GMFR in multivariable models included lower pre-vaccination HAI antibody titer for A(H1N1), B\/Colorado and B\/Phuket, and younger age for A(H1N1).Community-dwelling older adults\u00a0\u2265\u00a056\u00a0years of age were enrolled in a prospective, observational study of immunogenicity of 2018-2019 influenza vaccine. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers were measured pre-vaccination (Day 0) and four weeks after vaccination (Day 28) to calculate geometric mean titers, seropositivity (HAI titers\u00a0\u2265\u00a01:40), seroconversion (fourfold rise in HAI titer with post-vaccination titer\u00a0\u2265\u00a01:40) and geometric mean fold rise (GMFR). Linear regression models assessed the association of predictors of GMFR for each vaccine antigen.","97":"Climate change may significantly alter how organisms disperse, with implications for population spread and species management. Wind dispersed plants have emerged as a useful study system for investigating how climate change affects dispersal, though studies modeling wind dispersal often assume propagules are released from a single point on an individual. This simplifying assumption, while useful, may misestimate dispersal. Here, we investigate effects of climate change on dispersal distances and spread rates, examining how these quantities shift when accounting for all points of seed release on an individual. Using the wind-dispersed invasive thistles Carduus nutans and Carduus acanthoides, we quantify temperature-driven shifts in the distribution of flower head heights using a passive warming field experiment, and estimate how these shifts affect dispersal using the Wald analytical long distance (WALD) model; for C. nutans, we use existing demographic data to simulate how these shifts affect population spread rates. We also compare dispersal distances for both warmed and ambient temperature plants, considering the entire distribution of flower head heights versus the common assumption of point-source seed release at the maximum height. For experimentally-grown individuals, an approximately 0.6 \u00b0C higher growing temperature increased mean and maximum flower head height by 14.1 cm (15.0%) and 14.0 cm (13.2%), respectively, in C. nutans and by 21.2 cm (26.6%) and 31.8 cm (36.7%), respectively, in C. acanthoides. Seeds from warmed individuals were more likely to exceed a given dispersal distance than those from their unwarmed counterparts; warmed C. nutans and C. acanthoides seeds were on average 1.36 and 1.71 times as likely, respectively, to travel 10 m or more in dispersal simulations, with this disparity becoming higher at longer dispersal distances. For C. nutans, increased growing temperatures boosted simulated rates of population spread by 42.2%, while assuming dispersal from a maximum-height point source rather than the true distribution of flower head heights increased simulated spread by up to 28.5%. Our results not only demonstrate faster population spread under increased temperatures, but also have substantial implications for modeling such spread, as the common simplifying assumption of dispersal from a single maximum-height source may substantially overestimate spread rates.

We measured changes in permeability in trophoblasts and stromal cores using a dextran-based fluorescence assay and changes in HA receptor expression using immunofluorescent microscopy.During pregnancy, the Zika flavivirus (ZIKV) infects human placentas, inducing defects in the developing fetus. The flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) alters glycosaminoglycans on the endothelium, causing hyperpermeability in vitro and vascular leakage in vivo in a tissue-dependent manner. The contribution of ZIKV NS1 to placental dysfunction during ZIKV infection remains unknown.ZIKV NS1 in the presence and absence of ZIKV increased the permeability of anchoring villous explants. ZIKV NS1 induced shedding of HA and HS and altered expression of CD44 and LYVE-1 HA receptors on stromal fibroblasts and Hofbauer macrophages in villous cores. Hyaluronidase was also stimulated in NS1-treated trophoblasts.","99":" T cell responses exclusively targeting MHC-II-restricted epitopes. These responses were comparable in magnitude and differentiation to responses elicited by 68-1 vectors, but did not protect against SIV.

In the United States, tick-borne pathogens are the cause of the highest number of reported vector-borne diseases. In the mid-Atlantic region of the eastern United States, tick-borne diseases such as Lyme disease, have increased in incidence, with tick-host-pathogen interactions considered a contributing factor to this increase. Ticks become infected with pathogens after taking a blood meal from a systemically infected host or through a localized infection while co-feeding on a host with other infected ticks. The host not only plays a role in pathogen acquisition by the tick, but can also facilitate dispersal of the tick locally within a region or over greater distances into new geographical ranges outside of their historical distributional range. In this study conducted in southeastern Virginia (USA), we examined the interaction between both resident and migratory bird species and Ixodes ticks, the primary vectors of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) the main causative agent of Lyme disease on the East coast of the United States. Over a two-year period (2012-2014), 1879 passerine birds were surveyed, with 255 Ixodes ticks tested for the presence of Borrelia spp. Eighty passerine birds (4.3 %) representing 17 bird species were parasitized by at least one Ixodes tick, but only three bird species were parasitized by Ixodes ticks that tested positive for B. burgdorferi s.s. Twenty Ixodes ticks (7.8 %) tested positive for B. burgdorferi s.s. with nearly all collected from resident bird species including the Carolina wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus) and brown thrasher (Toxostoma rufum). Given that millions of birds pass through southeastern Virginia during migration, even with the low number of Ixodes ticks parasitizing passerine birds and the low prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.s. found within Ixodes ticks collected, the sheer volume of passerine birds suggests they may play a role in the maintenance and dispersal of B. burgdorferi s.s. in southeastern Virginia.","101":"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health threat with 1.27\u2009million and 4.95\u2009million deaths attributable to and associated with bacterial AMR, respectively, in 2019. Our aim is to estimate the vaccine avertable bacterial AMR burden based on existing and future vaccines at the regional and global levels by pathogen and infectious syndromes.We developed a static proportional impact model to estimate the vaccination impact on 15 bacterial pathogens in terms of reduction in age-specific AMR burden estimates for 2019 from the Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance project in direct proportion to efficacy, coverage, target population for protection, and duration of protection of existing and future vaccines.The AMR burden avertable by vaccination in 2019 was highest for the WHO Africa and South-East Asia regions, for lower respiratory infections, tuberculosis, and bloodstream infections by infectious syndromes, and for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Streptococcus pneumoniae by pathogen. In the baseline scenario for vaccination of primary age groups against 15 pathogens, we estimated vaccine-avertable AMR burden of 0.51 (95% UI 0.49-0.54)\u2009million deaths and 28 (27-29) million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) associated with bacterial AMR, and 0.15 (0.14-0.17)\u2009million deaths and 7.6 (7.1-8.0)\u2009million DALYs attributable to AMR globally in 2019. In the high-potential scenario for vaccination of additional age groups against seven pathogens, we estimated vaccine-avertable AMR burden of an additional 1.2 (1.18-1.23)\u2009million deaths and 37 (36-39) million DALYs associated with AMR, and 0.33 (0.32-0.34)\u2009million deaths and 10 (9.8-11)\u2009million DALYs attributable to AMR globally in 2019.Increased coverage of existing vaccines and development of new vaccines are effective means to reduce AMR, and this evidence should inform the full value of vaccine assessments.","102":"Prospective universal genotyping of tuberculosis (TB) isolates is used by many laboratories to detect clusters of cases and inform contact investigations. Prior to universal genotyping, most TB prevention programs genotyped isolates on request only, relying on requests from public health professionals whose knowledge of a patient's clinical, demographic, and epidemiological characteristics suggested potential transmission. To justify the switch from on-request to universal genotyping-particularly in the public health domain, with its limited resources and competing priorities-it is important to demonstrate the additional benefit provided by a universal genotyping program. We compared the clustering patterns revealed by retrospective 24-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable-number tandem repeat genotyping of all culture-positive isolates over a 5-year period to the patterns previously established by our genotyping-on-request program in the low-incidence setting of British Columbia, Canada. We found that 23.8% of isolates were requested during the study period, and while requested isolates had increased odds of belonging to a genotype cluster (adjusted odds ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 3.3), only 54.6% clustered with the requested comparator strain. Universal genotyping revealed 94 clusters ranging in size from 2 to 53 isolates (mean = 5) and involving 432 individuals. On-request genotyping missed 54 (57.4%) of these clusters and 130 (30.1%) clustered individuals. Our results underscore that TB patient networks are complex, with unrecognized linkages between patients, and a prospective province-wide universal genotyping program provides an informative, bias-free tool to explore transmission to a degree not possible with on-request genotyping.","103":"We used data from a survey in Cape Town (n\u202f=\u202f506) to describe age-mixing dynamics in the four population strata of HIV negative and HIV positive male and female participants. Mixed-effects models were used to calculate the average increase in partner age for each year increase in age of participant, the average partner age for 15\u202fyear olds, and the between-subject and the within-subject standard deviation of partner ages. We conducted 2000 bootstrap replications of the models. Using negative binomial models, we also explored whether HIV status was associated with participants having a larger range in partner ages.HIV positive women had large variability in partner ages at the population level, and at the individual level had nearly three times the expected range of partner ages compared to HIV negative women. This pattern may increase the potential for HIV transmission across birth cohorts and may partially explain the persistence of the epidemic in South Africa. Young men, who have been previously absent from the age-disparity discourse, also choose older partners who may be putting them at increased risk of HIV infection due to the high HIV prevalence among older age categories of women.Age-disparate relationships are thought to put young women at increased risk of HIV, though current evidence is inconclusive. Studying population-level age-mixing patterns as well as individual-level measures of age difference variation may provide insight into the persistence and magnitude of the epidemic in South Africa.","104":"Schools were closed extensively in 2020-21 to counter SARS-CoV-2 spread, impacting students' education and wellbeing. With highly contagious variants expanding in Europe, safe options to maintain schools open are urgently needed. By estimating school-specific transmissibility, our study evaluates costs and benefits of different protocols for SARS-CoV-2 control at school.EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe Framework Programme, Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANRS-Maladies Infectieuses \u00c9mergentes.) variants and performed a cost-benefit analysis examining different intervention protocols. to be 1\u00b766 (1\u00b760-1\u00b771) in primary schools and 1\u00b710 (1\u00b706-1\u00b714) in secondary schools. Under these conditions, weekly testing of 75% of unvaccinated students (PCR tests on saliva samples in primary schools and lateral flow tests in secondary schools), in addition to symptom-based testing, would reduce cases by 34% (95% CI 32-36) in primary schools and 36% (35-39) in secondary schools compared with symptom-based testing alone. Insufficient adherence was recorded in pilot screening (median \u226453%). Regular testing would also reduce student-days lost up to 80% compared with reactive class closures. Moderate vaccination coverage in students would still benefit from regular testing for additional control-ie, weekly testing 75% of unvaccinated students would reduce cases compared with symptom-based testing only, by 23% in primary schools when 50% of children are vaccinated.The COVID-19 pandemic will probably continue to pose a risk to the safe and normal functioning of schools. Extending vaccination coverage in students, complemented by regular testing with good adherence, are essential steps to keep schools open when highly transmissible variants are circulating.","105":"The burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) continues to increase in developing countries like China, but the access to STI care is often limited. The emergence of direct-to-consumer (DTC) telemedicine offers unique opportunities for patients to directly access health services when needed; However, the quality of STI care provided by telemedicine platforms remains unknown. After systemically identifying the universe of DTC telemedicine platforms providing on-demand consultations in China in 2019, we evaluated their quality using the method of unannounced standardized patients (SPs). SPs presented routine cases of syphilis and herpes. Of 110 SP visits conducted, physicians made a correct diagnosis in 44.5% (95% CI: 35.1% to 54.0%) of SP visits, and correctly managed 10.9% (95% CI: 5.0% to 16.8%). Low rates of correct management were primarily attributable to the failure of physicians to refer patients for STI testing. Controlling for other factors, videoconference (vs. SMS-based) consultation mode and the availability of public physician ratings were associated with higher-quality care. Our findings suggest a need for further research on the causal determinants of care quality on DTC telemedicine platforms and effective policy approaches to promote their potential to expand access to STI care in developing countries while limiting potential unintended consequences for patients.","106":"Many social and biological systems are characterized by enduring hierarchies, including those organized around prestige in academia, dominance in animal groups, and desirability in online dating. Despite their ubiquity, the general mechanisms that explain the creation and endurance of such hierarchies are not well understood. We introduce a generative model for the dynamics of hierarchies using time-varying networks in which new links are formed based on the preferences of nodes in the current network and old links are forgotten over time. The model produces a range of hierarchical structures, ranging from egalitarianism to bistable hierarchies, and we derive critical points that separate these regimes in the limit of long system memory. Distinctively, our model supports statistical inference, allowing for a principled comparison of generative mechanisms using data. We apply the model to study hierarchical structures in empirical data on hiring patterns among mathematicians, dominance relations among parakeets, and friendships among members of a fraternity, observing several persistent patterns as well as interpretable differences in the generative mechanisms favored by each. Our work contributes to the growing literature on statistically grounded models of time-varying networks.","107":", where the school in its entirety is screened on regular time intervals. Through this analysis, we demonstrate that repetitive testing strategies can significantly reduce the attack rate in schools, contrary to a reactive screening or a symptomatic isolation approach. However, when a repetitive testing strategy is in place, more cases will be detected and class and school closures are more easily triggered, leading to a higher number of school days lost per child. While maintaining the epidemic under control with a repetitive testing strategy, we show that absenteeism can be reduced by relaxing class and school closure thresholds.","108":" gc\/infection) and wastewater surveillance data to reported seroprevalence, we estimate that ~38% of individuals in Southern Nevada had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 as of April 2021, which is significantly higher than the 10% of individuals confirmed through clinical testing. Sewershed-specific ascertainment ratios (i.e., X-fold infection undercounts) ranged from 1.0 to 7.7, potentially due to demographic differences. Our data underscore the growing application of wastewater surveillance in not only the identification and quantification of infectious agents, but also the detection of variants of concern that may be missed when diagnostic testing is limited or unavailable.","109":"Shigella continues to be a major contributor to diarrheal illness and dysentery in children younger than 5\u2009years of age in low- and middle-income countries. Strategies for the prevention of shigellosis have focused on enhancing adaptive immunity. The interaction between Shigella and intrinsic host factors, such as the microbiome, remains unknown. We hypothesized that Shigella infection would impact the developing microbial community in infancy and, conversely, that changes in the gastrointestinal microbiome may predispose infections. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the gastrointestinal microbiota in a longitudinal birth cohort from Malawi that was monitored for Shigella infection using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Children with at least one Shigella quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) positive sample during the first 2\u2009years of life (cases) were compared to uninfected controls that were matched for sex and age. Overall, the microbial species diversity, as measured by the Shannon diversity index, increased over time, regardless of case status. At early time points, the microbial community was dominated by Bifidobacterium longum and Escherichia\/Shigella. A greater abundance of Prevotella 9 and Bifidobacterium kashiwanohense was observed at 2\u2009years of age. While no single species was associated with susceptibility to Shigella infection, significant increases in Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 and Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans were observed following Shigella infection. Both taxa are in the family Lachnospiraceae, which are known short-chain fatty acid producers that may improve gut health. Our findings identified temporal changes in the gastrointestinal microbiota associated with Shigella infection in Malawian children and highlight the need to further elucidate the microbial communities associated with disease susceptibility and resolution. IMPORTANCE Shigella causes more than 180 million cases of diarrhea globally, mostly in children living in poor regions. Infection can lead to severe health impairments that reduce quality of life. There is increasing evidence that disruptions in the gut microbiome early in life can influence susceptibility to illnesses. A delayed or impaired reconstitution of the microbiota following infection can further impact overall health. Aiming to improve our understanding of the interaction between Shigella and the developing infant microbiome, we investigated changes in the gut microbiome of Shigella-infected and uninfected children over the course of their first 2\u2009years of life. We identified species that may be involved in recovery from Shigella infection and in driving the microbiota back to homeostasis. These findings support future studies into the elucidation of the interaction between the microbiota and enteric pathogens in young children and into the identification of potential targets for prevention or treatment.","110":"Traffic signal control is one of the most common means of traffic management in urban areas. To create an efficient urban transportation network, the optimization of signal control strategy is required. Various methods and tools can be used for that purpose. This study proposes two signal control algorithms that are based on backpressure model, which is originally developed to maximize the throughput in communication networks. Thus, one of the goals was to determine if such control strategies can lead to maximum throughput through an urban traffic network. In addition, the evaluation of the two algorithms included comparison of their performances with the performances of the conventional signal control strategies in microsimulation software. Evaluation results, in terms of various performance measures, demonstrate that backpressure control models are outperformed by conventional (fixed and actuated) signal timings optimized by a genetic algorithm.","111":"Parasite avoidance is a host defense that reduces the contact rate with parasites. We investigate avoidance as a primary driver of variation among individuals in the risk of parasitism and the evolution of host-parasite interactions. To bridge mechanistic and taxonomic divides, we define and categorize avoidance by its function and position in the sequence of host defenses. We also examine the role of avoidance in limiting epidemics and evaluate evidence for the processes that drive its evolution. Throughout, we highlight important directions to advance our conceptual and theoretical understanding of the role of avoidance in host-parasite interactions. We emphasize the need to test assumptions and quantify the effect of avoidance independent of other defenses. Importantly, many open questions may be most tractable in host systems that have not been the focus of traditional behavioral avoidance research, such as plants and invertebrates.","112":"FNY collects limited demographic characteristic information upon registration, and prompts users each Monday to report symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) experienced during the previous week. We calculated the descriptive statistics and rates of ILI for the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 seasons. We compared raw and noise-filtered ILI rates with ILI rates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ILINet surveillance system.More than 61 000 participants submitted at least 1 report during the 2012-2013 season, totaling 327 773 reports. Nearly 40 000 participants submitted at least 1 report during the 2013-2014 season, totaling 336 933 reports. Rates of ILI as reported by FNY tracked closely with ILINet in both timing and magnitude.With increased participation, FNY has the potential to serve as a viable complement to existing outpatient, hospital-based, and laboratory surveillance systems. Although many established systems have the benefits of specificity and credibility, participatory systems offer advantages in the areas of speed, sensitivity, and scalability.We summarized Flu Near You (FNY) data from the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 influenza seasons in the United States.","113":"The prevalence of cavitated level caries experience at age 23 (mean D2+MFS count) was 4.75. The predictive analysis found LASSO to be the best performing model (compared to GBM, NegGLM, and XGBOOST), with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.70, and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.44. After dichotomization of the predicted and observed values of the LASSO regression, the classification results showed accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC of 83.7%, 85.9%, 93.1%, 68.2%, respectively. Previous caries experience at age 13 and age 17 and sugar-sweetened beverages intakes at age 13 and age 17 were found to be the four most important predictors of cavitated caries count at age 23.Our machine learning model showed high accuracy and precision in the prediction of caries in young adults from a longitudinally-obtained predictor variables. Our model could, in the future, after further development and validation with other diverse population data, be used by public health specialists and policy-makers as a screening tool to identify the risk of caries in young adults and apply more targeted interventions. However, data from a more diverse population are needed to improve the quality and generalizability of caries prediction.To predict the dental caries outcomes in young adults from a set of longitudinally-obtained predictor variables and identify the most important predictors using machine learning techniques.This study was conducted using the Iowa Fluoride Study dataset. The predictor variables - sex, mother's education, family income, composite socio-economic status (SES), caries experience at ages 9, 13, and 17, and the cumulative estimates of risk and protective factors, including fluoride, dietary, and behavioral variables from ages 5-9, 9-13, 13-17, and 17-23 were used to predict the age 23 D2+MFS count. The following machine learning models (LASSO regression, generalized boosting machines (GBM), negative binomial (NegGLM), and extreme gradient boosting models (XGBOOST)) were compared under 5-fold cross validation with nested resampling techniques.","114":"A significant portion of funding for art comes from foundations, representing a key revenue stream for most art organizations. Little is known, however, about the quantitative patterns that govern art funding, limiting the fundraising efficiency of organizations in need of resources, as well as optimal funding allocation of donors. To address these shortcomings, here we relied on the IRS e-file dataset to identify $36B in grants from 46,643 foundations to 48,766 art recipients between 2010 and 2019, allowing us to quantify donor-recipient relationships in art. We find that philanthropic giving is broadly distributed, following a stable power-law distribution, indicating that some funders give considerably and predictably more than others. Giving is highly localized, with 60% of grants and funds going to recipients in the donor's state. Furthermore, donors often support multiple local organizations that offer distinct artforms, rather than advancing a particular subarea within art. Donor retention is strong, with nearly 70% of relationships continuing the next year. Finally, we explored the role of institutional prestige in foundation giving, finding that funding does correlate with prestige, with notable exceptions. Our results present the largest and most comprehensive data-driven exploration of giving by foundations to art to date, unveiling multiple insights that could benefit both donors and recipients.","115":", which aims to structure and facilitate the processes by which basic and applied NLP research inform one another. Translational NLP thus presents a third research paradigm, focused on understanding the challenges posed by application needs and how these challenges can drive innovation in basic science and technology design.

Our framework provides a roadmap for developing Translational NLP as a dedicated research area, and identifies general translational principles to facilitate exchange between basic and applied research.","116":"Budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is widely used as a model organism to study the genetics underlying eukaryotic cellular processes and growth critical to cancer development, such as cell division and cell cycle progression. The budding yeast cell cycle is also one of the best-studied dynamical systems owing to its thoroughly resolved genetics. However, the dynamics underlying the crucial cell cycle decision point called the START transition, at which the cell commits to a new round of DNA replication and cell division, are under-studied. The START machinery involves a central cyclin-dependent kinase; cyclins responsible for starting the transition, bud formation, and initiating DNA synthesis; and their transcriptional regulators. However, evidence has shown that the mechanism is more complicated than a simple irreversible transition switch. Activating a key transcription regulator SBF requires the phosphorylation of its inhibitor, Whi5, or an SBF\/MBF monomeric component, Swi6, but not necessarily both. Also, the timing and mechanism of the inhibitor Whi5's nuclear export, while important, are not critical for the timing and execution of START. Therefore, there is a need for a consolidated model for the budding yeast START transition, reconciling regulatory and spatial dynamics. We built a detailed mathematical model (START-BYCC) for the START transition in the budding yeast cell cycle based on established molecular interactions and experimental phenotypes. START-BYCC recapitulates the underlying dynamics and correctly emulates key phenotypic traits of ~150 known START mutants, including regulation of size control, localization of inhibitor\/transcription factor complexes, and the nutritional effects on size control. Such a detailed mechanistic understanding of the underlying dynamics gets us closer towards deconvoluting the aberrant cellular development in cancer.","117":"International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Registry (ISRCTN15157105).Acute febrile illness (AFI), traditionally attributed to malaria, is a common reason for seeking primary healthcare in rural South and Southeast Asia. However, malaria transmission has declined while health workers are often poorly equipped to manage non-malarial AFIs. This results in indiscriminate antibiotic prescribing and care escalation, which promotes antibiotic resistance and may increase healthcare costs. To address this problem, an electronic clinical decision support algorithm (eCDSA) called 'Electronic clinical Decision support for Acute fever Management (EDAM)' has been developed for primary health workers which integrates clinical, epidemiological and vital sign data with simple point-of-care tests to produce a diagnosis and management plan.This is a pragmatic cluster-randomised trial aiming to assess the effect of EDAM and related training on antibiotic prescribing rates in rural Cambodian primary health centres (PHCs) as the primary outcome, along with a range of secondary outcomes including safety. Patients with AFI are eligible for recruitment if they are aged \u22651 year. A cluster is defined as a PHC and PHCs will be randomised to control (standard of care) and intervention (EDAM and associated training) arms, with 15 PHCs per arm. Patients will be followed up after 7\u2009days to ascertain the safety profile of EDAM. Each PHC will recruit 152 patients (total 4560), based on a baseline antibiotic prescription rate of 25% and expected reduction to 17.5% with EDAM.Results will be published in international peer-reviewed journals to inform the design of future versions of EDAM and of future trials of similar eCDSAs and other digital health interventions targeted towards rural populations.

For example, in models mutually adjusting for CD political and social metrics and vaccination rates, Republican trifecta and conservative voter political lean independently remained significantly associated with an 11%-26% higher COVID-19 mortality rate.Associations between the political ideologies of US federal elected officials and state concentrations of political party power with population health warrant greater consideration in public health analyses and monitoring dashboards.Scant research, including in the United States, has quantified relationships between the political ideologies of elected representatives and COVID-19 outcomes among their constituents.This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.We analyzed observational cross-sectional data on COVID-19 mortality rates (age-standardized) and stress on hospital intensive care unit (ICU) capacity for all 435 US Congressional Districts (CDs) in a period of adult vaccine availability (April 2021-March 2022). Political metrics comprised: (1) ideological scores based on each US Representative's and Senator's concurrent overall voting record and their specific COVID-19 votes, and (2) state trifectas (Governor, State House, and State Senate under the same political party control).

We then applied these methods to develop prediction models of survival and neurodevelopmental outcomes based on the NICHD Extremely Preterm Birth Outcome Tool model. The statistical and practical advantages and flaws of these methods were examined. Both discrimination and calibration of the estimated logistic models of dichotomized outcomes and continuation-ratio logit model were assessed.Medical outcomes of interest to clinicians may have multiple categories. Researchers face several options for risk prediction of such outcomes, including dichotomized logistic regression and multinomial logit regression modeling. We aimed to compare these methods and provide guidance needed for practice.The dichotomized logistic models and multinomial continuation-ratio logit model had similar discrimination and calibration in predicting death and survival without neurodevelopmental impairment. But the continuation-ratio logit model had better discrimination and calibration in predicting neurodevelopmental impairment. The sum of predicted probabilities of outcome categories from the dichotomized logistic models could deviate from 100% substantially, ranging from 87.7 to 124.0%, and the dichotomized logistic model of neurodevelopmental impairment greatly overpredicted low risks and underpredicted high risks.Estimating multiple logistic regression models of dichotomized outcomes may result in poorly calibrated predictions for an outcome with multiple ordinal categories. Multinomial continuation-ratio logit regression produces better calibrated predictions, constrains the sum of predicted probabilities to 100%, and has the advantages of simplicity in model interpretation, flexibility to include outcome category-specific predictors and random-effect terms for patient heterogeneity by hospital. It also accounts for mutual dependence among multiple categories and accommodates competing risks.","121":"Compared with the bivalent vaccine, the use of the nonavalent vaccine was associated with an ICER of S$61,629 per quality-adjusted life year gained in the base case. The result was robust across a range of plausible input values, and to assumptions regarding the duration of vaccine protection.The nonavalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been shown to extend protection against oncogenic HPV types 31\/33\/45\/52\/58 (HPV-OV) not covered by the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines. Besides its clinical benefit, evidence on the economic value of the nonavalent vaccine is required to inform local vaccination strategies and funding decisions. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of replacing the bivalent vaccine with the nonavalent vaccine in the national school-based HPV vaccination programme in Singapore.Given the high ICER, the nonavalent vaccine is unlikely to represent a cost-effective option compared with the bivalent vaccine for school-based HPV vaccination of 13-year old female students in Singapore. Substantial price reductions would be required to justify its inclusion in the school-based programme in the future.An existing age-structured dynamic transmission model coupled with stochastic individual-based simulations was adapted to project the health and economic impact of vaccinating 13-year-old girls with two doses of the nonavalent or bivalent HPV vaccines in Singapore. Direct costs (in Singapore dollars, S$) were obtained from public healthcare institutions in Singapore, while health state utilities were sourced from the literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated over a lifetime horizon, from a healthcare system perspective. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to obtain the ICERs and corresponding variations across variable uncertainty. Particularly, this study tested the scenarios of lifelong and 20-year vaccine-induced protection, assumed 96.0% and 22.3% cross-protection against HPV-OV by nonavalent and bivalent vaccines respectively, and fixed vaccine prices per dose at S$188 for nonavalent and S$61.50 for bivalent vaccines.","122":"Both incidence and geographical range of tick-borne disease has increased across the USA.

This study identifies demographic and co-infection risk factors for canine seropositivity to tick-borne infections in a cohort of hunting dogs across the USA.Human patterns of tick-borne disease co-infection in the USA have been predominantly driven by the geographical distribution of the tick vector. Dogs who tested seropositive for Anaplasma spp. were 1.40 times more likely (P = 0.0242) to also test seropositive for Babesia spp. and vice versa (1.60 times more likely, P = 0.0014). Dogs living in the West had 5% lower risk (P = 0.0001) for Ehrlichia spp. seropositivity compared to other regions. Controlling for age and Anaplasma spp. seroprevalence, dogs in all three other regions were 2.30 times more likely (P = 0.0216) to test seropositive for B. burgdorferi than dogs in the West. Dogs seropositive for B. burgdorferi were 1.60 times more likely (P = 0.0473) to be seropositive for Anaplasma spp.Tick geographical distributions have a prominent impact on the regional distribution of hunting dog exposure to tick-borne diseases. Education concerning regional tick prevalence and disease risk is important for everyone, but particularly dog owners, regarding ticks in their region and protection from infection and co-infection of tick-borne pathogens as they travel or move with their dogs. Dogs are sentinel species for human exposure to ticks, and as such surveillance of canine tick-borne infections and understanding the probability that these infections might be seen together as co-infections helps predict emerging areas where people are more likely to be exposed as well.","123":"About 19.0% of cancer survivors were current smokers, out of whom 60.4% made attempt to quit smoking in the past 12 months, and 26.2% reported experiencing food insecurity in the past 12 months. Food insecurity was significantly associated with smoking status and quit attempt after controlling for individual-level characteristics. The odds of being a current smoker, [AOR 1.45 (95% CI 1.10-2.02)], and making quit attempt, [AOR 1.74 (95% CI 1.10, 2.83)], were higher for food insecure cancer survivors compared to food secure cancer survivors.This cross-sectional study examined whether food insecurity among cancer survivors is associated with smoking status and quit attempt.Food insecurity, in addition to smoking, may hinder the progress of care and treatment, requiring the development of new policies for routine food insecurity screening among cancer survivors. Efforts should be focused on identifying food insecure cancer survivors, targeting their smoking behavior, and offering them appropriate nutritional and smoking cessation interventions.Data from the 2015 behavioral risk factor surveillance system, social context module on 6,481 adult cancer survivors, were used in this study. Outcome variables were smoking status and quit attempt. Key independent variable was food insecurity. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using weighted multivariable logistic regression models while controlling for individual-level demographic, socioeconomic, clinical, and behavioral characteristics.","124":"Our data includes longitudinal Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 scores over 4 years for assessing depression severity from the Mental Health Research Network. We analyzed >\u20093,000 patients with at least six PHQ-9 observations who have ongoing treatment. We used smoothing splines to model individual depression trajectories. We then used K-means clustering and collaborative modeling (CM) to identify subgroup patterns. We further predicted the individuals' PHQ-9 scores based on depression trajectories learnt from individual growth model (IGM), mixed effect model (MEM), CM, and similarity-based CM (SCM), and compared their predictive performances.Our EHR data provide limited information on patients' demographic, socioeconomic, and other clinical factors that may be relevant to improve model performances.We established a trajectory-based framework for depression assessment and prognosis that is adaptable to model population heterogeneity using EHR data. Collaborative modeling outperformed other established methods.Depression is a common, complex, and dynamic mental disorder. Mitigating depression has become a national health priority as it affects 1 out of 10 American adults and is the most common mental illness seen in primary care. The emerging use of electronic health record (EHR) provides an unprecedented information infrastructure to understand depression trajectories.We aim to effectively analyze patterns in the collected depression trajectories of a treatment population and compare several methods to predict individual trajectories for monitoring treatment outcomes.We found five broad trajectory patterns in the ongoing treatment population: stable high, stable low, fluctuating moderate, an increasing and a decreasing group. For prediction, the root mean square error (rMSE) in the testing set for IGM, MEM, CM, and SCM are 12.53, 5.91, 5.18, and 3.21.","125":"For every 1-unit increase in the log concentration of vanadium in groundwater at the aquifer level, infection risk increased by 22% among MAC patients. We did not observe significant associations between water-quality constituents and infection risk among M. abscessus patients.Hawai'i has the highest prevalence of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) pulmonary disease in the United States. Previous studies indicate that certain trace metals in surface water increase the risk of NTM infection.A population-based ecologic cohort study was conducted using NTM infection incidence data from patients enrolled at Kaiser Permanente Hawai'i during 2005-2019. We obtained sociodemographic, microbiologic, and geocoded residential data for all Kaiser Permanente Hawai'i beneficiaries. To estimate the risk of NTM pulmonary infection from exposure to groundwater constituents, we obtained groundwater data from three data sources: (1) Water Quality Portal; (2) the Hawai'i Department of Health; and (3) Brigham Young University, Department of Geological Science faculty. Data were aggregated by an aquifer and were associated with the corresponding beneficiary aquifer of residence. We used Poisson regression models with backward elimination to generate models for NTM infection risk as a function of groundwater constituents. We modeled two outcomes: Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) species and Mycobacterium abscessus group species.To identify whether trace metals influence the risk of NTM infection in O'ahu, Hawai'i.Concentrations of vanadium in groundwater were associated with MAC pulmonary infection in O'ahu, Hawai'i. These findings provide evidence that naturally occurring trace metals influence the presence of NTM in water sources that supply municipal water systems.","126":"The continual emergence of novel influenza A strains from non-human hosts requires constant vigilance and the need for ongoing research to identify strains that may pose a human public health risk. Since 1999, canine H3 influenza A viruses (CIVs) have caused many thousands or millions of respiratory infections in dogs in the United States. While no human infections with CIVs have been reported to date, these viruses could pose a zoonotic risk. In these studies, the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance (CEIRS) network collaboratively demonstrated that CIVs replicated in some primary human cells and transmitted effectively in mammalian models. While people born after 1970 had little or no pre-existing humoral immunity against CIVs, the viruses were sensitive to existing antivirals and we identified a panel of H3 cross-reactive human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) that could have prophylactic and\/or therapeutic value. Our data predict these CIVs posed a low risk to humans. Importantly, we showed that the CEIRS network could work together to provide basic research information important for characterizing emerging influenza viruses, although there were valuable lessons learned.","127":"The Delta variant (B.1.617.2) is estimated to be more transmissible than previous strains of SARS-CoV-2, especially among children and adolescents. However, to our knowledge, there are no reports confirming this to date.Among 106\u202f866 confirmed COVID-19 infections (including 26\u202f597 infections and 80\u202f269 infections during the third and fourth waves of COVID-19 in Korea, respectively), a significant difference in age-specific susceptibility to the Delta vs pre-Delta variant was found in the younger age group. After adjustment for contact pattern and vaccination status, the increase in susceptibility to the Delta vs pre-Delta variant was estimated to be highest in the group aged 10 to 15 years, approximately doubling (1.92-fold increase [95% CI, 1.86-fold to 1.98-fold]), whereas in the group aged 50 years or more, susceptibility to the Delta vs pre-Delta variant remained stable at an approximately 1-fold change (eg, among individuals aged 50-55 years: 0.997-fold [95% CI, 0.989-fold to 1.001-fold).Age group during the third wave (ie, before Delta) and fourth wave (ie, Delta-driven) of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea.Age-specific susceptibility during the third and fourth waves was estimated.This decision analytic model used an age-structured compartmental model using the terms symptom onset (S), exposure (E), infectious (I), and quarantine (Q) (SEIQ) to estimate the age-specific force of infection, combining age-specific contact matrices and observed distribution of periods between each stage of infection (E to I [ie, latent period], I given S, and S to Q [ie, diagnostic delay]) developed in a previous contact tracing study. A bayesian inference method was used to estimate the age-specific force of infection (S to E) and, accordingly, age-specific susceptibility. The age-specific susceptibility during the third wave (ie, before Delta, from October 15 to December 22, 2020, when the COVID-19 vaccination campaign was not yet launched) and the fourth wave (ie, the Delta-driven wave, from June 27 to August 21, 2021) in Korea were compared. As vaccine uptake increased, individuals who were vaccinated were excluded from the susceptible population in accordance with vaccine effectiveness against the Delta variant. This nationwide epidemiologic study included individuals who were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period in Korea. Data were analyzed from September to November 2021.In this study, the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to propagate more easily among children and adolescents than pre-Delta strains, even after adjusting for contact pattern and vaccination status.To gain a better understanding of the association of age with susceptibility to the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2.","128":"Since 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has hosted an annual influenza season forecasting challenge. The 2015-2016 challenge consisted of weekly probabilistic forecasts of multiple targets, including fourteen models submitted by eleven teams. Forecast skill was evaluated using a modified logarithmic score. We averaged submitted forecasts into a mean ensemble model and compared them against predictions based on historical trends. Forecast skill was highest for seasonal peak intensity and short-term forecasts, while forecast skill for timing of season onset and peak week was generally low. Higher forecast skill was associated with team participation in previous influenza forecasting challenges and utilization of ensemble forecasting techniques. The mean ensemble consistently performed well and outperformed historical trend predictions. CDC and contributing teams will continue to advance influenza forecasting and work to improve the accuracy and reliability of forecasts to facilitate increased incorporation into public health response efforts.","129":"Influenza causes significant morbidity and mortality each year, with 2-8% of weekly outpatient visits around the United States for influenza-like-illness (ILI) during the peak of the season. Effective use of existing flu surveillance data allows officials to understand and predict current flu outbreaks and can contribute to reductions in influenza morbidity and mortality. Previous work used the 2009-2010 influenza season to investigate the possibility of using existing military and civilian surveillance systems to improve early detection of flu outbreaks. Results suggested that civilian surveillance could help predict outbreak trajectory in local military installations. To further test that hypothesis, we compare pairs of civilian and military outbreaks in seven locations between 2000 and 2013. We find no predictive relationship between outbreak peaks or time series of paired outbreaks. This larger study does not find evidence to support the hypothesis that civilian data can be used as sentinel surveillance for military installations. We additionally investigate the effect of modifying the ILI case definition between the standard Department of Defense definition, a more specific definition proposed in literature, and confirmed Influenza A. We find that case definition heavily impacts results. This study thus highlights the importance of careful selection of case definition, and appropriate consideration of case definition in the interpretation of results. ","130":"To inform the dynamic adjustments of vaccination campaigns, this study examined the transitions among vaccine hesitancy profiles over the COVID-19 pandemic progression and their predictors and outcomes. The transition patterns among hesitancy profiles over three periods were identified using a latent transition analysis with individuals from a longitudinal cohort study since the emergence of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Four profiles (i.e., skeptics, apathetics, fence-sitters, and believers) emerged consistently over time. From Period 1 (third and fourth pandemic waves) to Period 2 (dormant period, vaccine rollout), 14.17% of believers became fence-sitters (ambivalization), and 12.11% of fence-sitters became apathetics (apathetization). From Period 2 to Period 3 (omicron surge and vaccine mandates), 20.21% of believers became fence-sitters. Lower trust in government predicted a transition to skepticism, whereas higher trust predicted the opposite. Staying as believers was associated with decreased hygienic and social distancing behavior. The stable hesitancy profiles amid the rapid vaccine uptake suggest that structural factors rather than personal agency may drive the surge. Ambivalization and apathetization may signal disengagement in preventive behaviors. Trust in the government is crucial in the pandemic response. Public health interventions may improve compliance with guidelines and prevent skepticism and apathy.","131":"The emergence of COVID-19 variants with immune scape and the waning of primary vaccine schemes effectiveness have prompted many countries to indicate first and second booster COVID-19 vaccine doses to prevent severe COVID-19. However, current available evidence on second booster dose effectiveness are mostly limited to high-income countries, older adults, and mRNA-based vaccination schemes scenarios. We aimed to investigate the relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of the fourth dose compared to three doses for severe COVID-19 outcomes in Brazil; and compare the rVE of a fourth dose with an mRNA vaccine compared to adenovirus-based product in the same settings.We performed a target emulated trial using a population-based cohort of individuals aged 40 years or older who have received a homologous primary scheme of CoronaVac, ChAdOx1, or BNT162b2, and any third dose product and were eligible for the fourth dose in Brazil. The primary outcome was COVID-19 associated hospitalization or death. We built Cohort A matching individuals vaccinated with a fourth dose to individuals who received three doses to estimate the rVE of the fourth dose. We built Cohort B, a subset of Cohort A, matching mRNA-based (mRNA) to adenovirus-based fourth dose vaccinated individuals to compare their relative hazards for severe COVID-19.46,693,484 individuals were included in Cohort A and 6,763,016 in Cohort B. 45% of them were aged between 40 and 60 years old, and 48% between 60 and 79 years old. In Cohort A, the most common previous series was a ChAdOx1 two-dose followed by BNT162b2 (44%), and a CoronaVac two-dose followed by a BNT162b2 (36%). Among those fourth dose vaccinated, 36.9% received ChAdOx1, 32.7% Ad26.COV2.S, 25.8% BNT162b2, and 4.7% CoronaVac. In Cohort B, among those who received an adenovirus fourth dose, 53.7% received ChAdOx1 and 46.3% received Ad26.COV2.S. The estimated rVE for the primary outcome of four doses compared to three doses was 44.1% (95% CI 42.3-46.0), with some waning during follow-up (rVE 7-60 days 46.8% [95% CI 44.4-49.1], rVE after 120 days 33.8% [95% CI 18.0-46.6]). Among fourth dose vaccinated individuals, mRNA-based vaccinated individuals had lower hazards for hospitalization or death compared to adenovirus-vaccinated individuals (HR\u00a00.81, 95% CI 0.75-0.87). After 120 days, no difference in hazards between groups was observed (HR 1.35, 95% CI 0.93-1.97). Similar findings were observed for hospitalization and death separately, except no evidence for differences between fourth dose brands for death in Cohort B.In a heterogeneous scenario of primary and first booster vaccination combinations, a fourth dose provided meaningful and durable protection against severe COVID-19 outcomes. Compared to adenovirus-based booster, a fourth dose wild-type mRNA vaccine was associated with immediate lower hazards of hospitalization or death unsustained after 120 days.None.","132":"Understanding the levels and trends of the leading causes of death and disability among children and adolescents is critical to guide investment and inform policies. Monitoring these trends over time is also key to understanding where interventions are having an impact. Proven interventions exist to prevent or treat the leading causes of unnecessary death and disability among children and adolescents. The findings presented here show that these are underused and give guidance to policy makers in countries where more attention is needed.Of the 7.7 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 7.4-8.1) million deaths among children and adolescents globally in 2013, 6.28 million occurred among younger children, 0.48 million among older children, and 0.97 million among adolescents. In 2013, the leading causes of death were lower respiratory tract infections among younger children (905.059 deaths; 95% UI, 810,304-998,125), diarrheal diseases among older children (38,325 deaths; 95% UI, 30,365-47,678), and road injuries among adolescents (115,186 deaths; 95% UI, 105,185-124,870). Iron deficiency anemia was the leading cause of years lived with disability among children and adolescents, affecting 619 (95% UI, 618-621) million in 2013. Large between-country variations exist in mortality from leading causes among children and adolescents. Countries with rapid declines in all-cause mortality between 1990 and 2013 also experienced large declines in most leading causes of death, whereas countries with the slowest declines had stagnant or increasing trends in the leading causes of death. In 2013, Nigeria had a 12% global share of deaths from lower respiratory tract infections and a 38% global share of deaths from malaria. India had 33% of the world's deaths from neonatal encephalopathy. Half of the world's diarrheal deaths among children and adolescents occurred in just 5 countries: India, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Ethiopia.The literature focuses on mortality among children younger than 5 years. Comparable information on nonfatal health outcomes among these children and the fatal and nonfatal burden of diseases and injuries among older children and adolescents is scarce.To determine levels and trends in the fatal and nonfatal burden of diseases and injuries among younger children (aged <5 years), older children (aged 5-9 years), and adolescents (aged 10-19 years) between 1990 and 2013 in 188 countries from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 study.Data from vital registration, verbal autopsy studies, maternal and child death surveillance, and other sources covering 14,244 site-years (ie, years of cause of death data by geography) from 1980 through 2013 were used to estimate cause-specific mortality. Data from 35,620 epidemiological sources were used to estimate the prevalence of the diseases and sequelae in the GBD 2013 study. Cause-specific mortality for most causes was estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble Model strategy. For some infectious diseases (eg, HIV infection\/AIDS, measles, hepatitis B) where the disease process is complex or the cause of death data were insufficient or unavailable, we used natural history models. For most nonfatal health outcomes, DisMod-MR 2.0, a Bayesian metaregression tool, was used to meta-analyze the epidemiological data to generate prevalence estimates.","133":"Meta-analyses reveal high diagnostic accuracy of molecular tests for thyroid nodule assessment of malignancy risk; however, these studies are subject to several limitations. Limitations and their potential clinical impacts must be addressed and, when feasible, adjusted for using valid statistical methodologies.Molecular tests for thyroid nodules with indeterminate fine needle aspiration results are increasingly used in clinical practice; however, true diagnostic summaries of these tests are unknown. A systematic review and meta-analysis were completed to (1) evaluate the accuracy of commercially available molecular tests for malignancy in indeterminate thyroid nodules and (2) quantify biases and limitations in studies which validate those tests.PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were systematically searched through July 2021. English language articles that reported original clinical validation attempts of molecular tests for indeterminate thyroid nodules were included if they reported counts of true negative, true positive, false negative, and false positive results. We performed screening and full text review, followed by assessment of eight common biases and limitations, extraction of diagnostic and histopathological information, and meta-analysis of clinical validity using a bivariate linear mixed-effects model.49 studies were included. Meta-analysis of Afirma GEC (n=38 studies) revealed a sensitivity of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.90-0.94), specificity of 0.26 (0.20-0.32), negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.32 (0.23-0.44), positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 1.24 (1.15-1.35), and AUC of 0.83 (0.74-0.89). Afirma GSC (n=10) had a sensitivity of 0.94 (0.89-0.96), specificity of 0.38 (0.27-0.50), LR- of 0.18 (0.10-0.30), LR+ of 1.52 (1.28-1.87), and AUC of 0.91 (0.62-0.92). ThyroSeq v1 and v2 (n=10) had a sensitivity of 0.86 (0.82-0.90), specificity of 0.74 (0.59-0.85), LR- of 0.19 (0.13-0.26), LR+ of 3.52 (2.08-5.92), and AUC of 0.86 (0.81-0.90). ThyroSeq v3 (n=6) had a sensitivity of 0.92 (0.86-0.95), specificity of 0.41 (0.18-0.69), LR- of 0.24 (0.09-0.62), LR+ of 1.67 (1.09-2.98), and AUC of 0.90 (0.63-0.92). 14% of studies conducted blinded histopathologic review of excised thyroid nodules, and 8% made the decision to go to surgery blind to molecular test results.","134":"Forecasts support decision making in a variety of applications. Statistical models can produce accurate forecasts given abundant training data, but when data is sparse or rapidly changing, statistical models may not be able to make accurate predictions. Expert judgmental forecasts-models that combine expert-generated predictions into a single forecast-can make predictions when training data is limited by relying on human intuition. Researchers have proposed a wide array of algorithms to combine expert predictions into a single forecast, but there is no consensus on an optimal aggregation model. This review surveyed recent literature on aggregating expert-elicited predictions. We gathered common terminology, aggregation methods, and forecasting performance metrics, and offer guidance to strengthen future work that is growing at an accelerated pace.","135":"Outbreak.info Research Library is a standardized, searchable interface of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) publications, clinical trials, datasets, protocols and other resources, built with a reusable framework.

This year's outbreak has been characterized by an early seasonal surge in cases, rapid geographic spread, and a high fatality rate. The alarming trends in dengue incidence and mortality this year is an urgent wake-up call for public health policymakers and researchers to pay closer attention to dengue dynamics in South Asia, to strengthen the surveillance system and diagnostic capabilities, and to develop tools and methods for guiding strategic resource allocation and control efforts.","137":"Characteristics of the sleep-site are thought to influence the quality and duration of primate sleep, yet only a handful of studies have investigated these links experimentally. Using actigraphy and infrared videography, we quantified sleep in four lemur species (Eulemur coronatus, Lemur catta, Propithecus coquereli, and Varecia rubra) under two different experimental conditions at the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in Durham, NC, USA. Individuals from each species underwent three weeks of simultaneous testing to investigate the hypothesis that comfort level of the sleep-site influences sleep. We obtained baseline data on normal sleep, and then, in a pair-wise study design, we compared the daily sleep times, inter-daily activity stability, and intra-daily activity variability of individuals in simultaneous experiments of sleep-site enrichment and sleep-site impoverishment. Over 164 24-hour periods from 8 individuals (2 of each species), we found evidence that enriched sleep-sites increased daily sleep times of lemurs, with an average increase of thirty-two minutes. The effect of sleep-site impoverishment was small and not statistically significant. Though our experimental manipulations altered inter-daily stability and intra-daily variability in activity patterns relative to baseline, the changes did not differ significantly between enriched and impoverished conditions. We conclude that properties of a sleep-site enhancing softness or insulation, more than the factors of surface area or stability, influence lemur sleep, with implications regarding the importance of nest building in primate evolution and the welfare and management of captive lemurs.","138":"Microsimulation models are becoming increasingly common in the field of decision modeling for health. Because microsimulation models are computationally more demanding than traditional Markov cohort models, the use of computer programming languages in their development has become more common. R is a programming language that has gained recognition within the field of decision modeling. It has the capacity to perform microsimulation models more efficiently than software commonly used for decision modeling, incorporate statistical analyses within decision models, and produce more transparent models and reproducible results. However, no clear guidance for the implementation of microsimulation models in R exists. In this tutorial, we provide a step-by-step guide to build microsimulation models in R and illustrate the use of this guide on a simple, but transferable, hypothetical decision problem. We guide the reader through the necessary steps and provide generic R code that is flexible and can be adapted for other models. We also show how this code can be extended to address more complex model structures and provide an efficient microsimulation approach that relies on vectorization solutions.","139":"Endothelial dysfunction and vascular leak, pathogenic hallmarks of severe dengue disease, are directly triggered by dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein 1 (NS1). Previous studies have shown that immunization with NS1, as well as passive transfer of NS1-immune serum or anti-NS1 mAb, prevent NS1-mediated lethality in vivo. In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective capacity of recombinant DENV NS1 administered with cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), potent activators of innate immune pathways and highly immunogenic adjuvants. Using both wild-type C57BL\/6 mice and IFN-\u03b1\/\u03b2 receptor-deficient mice, we show that NS1-CDN immunizations elicit serotype-specific and cross-reactive Ab and T cell responses. Furthermore, NS1-CDN vaccinations conferred significant homotypic and heterotypic protection from DENV2-induced morbidity and mortality. In addition, we demonstrate that high anti-NS1 Ab titers are associated with protection, supporting the role of humoral responses against DENV NS1 as correlates of protection. These findings highlight the potential of CDN-based adjuvants for inducing Ab and T cell responses and validate NS1 as an important candidate for dengue vaccine development.","140":"Plants and animals detect the presence of potential pathogens through the perception of conserved microbial patterns by cell surface receptors. Certain solanaceous plants, including tomato, potato and pepper, detect flgII-28, a region of bacterial flagellin that is distinct from that perceived by the well-characterized FLAGELLIN-SENSING 2 receptor. Here we identify and characterize the receptor responsible for this recognition in tomato, called FLAGELLIN-SENSING 3. This receptor binds flgII-28 and enhances immune responses leading to a reduction in bacterial colonization of leaf tissues. Further characterization of FLS3 and its signalling pathway could provide new insights into the plant immune system and transfer of the receptor to other crop plants offers the potential of enhancing resistance to bacterial pathogens that have evolved to evade FLS2-mediated immunity.","141":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the measures taken by authorities to control its spread have altered human behavior and mobility patterns in an unprecedented way. However, it remains unclear whether the population response to a COVID-19 outbreak varies within a city or among demographic groups. Here, we utilized passively recorded cellular signaling data at a spatial resolution of 1 km \u00d7 1 km for over 5 million users and epidemiological surveillance data collected during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron BA.2 outbreak from February to June 2022 in Shanghai, China, to investigate the heterogeneous response of different segments of the population at the within-city level and examine its relationship with the actual risk of infection. Changes in behavior were spatially heterogenous within the city and population groups and associated with both the infection incidence and adopted interventions. We also found that males and individuals aged 30 to 59 y old traveled more frequently, traveled longer distances, and their communities were more connected; the same groups were also associated with the highest SARS-CoV-2 incidence. Our results highlight the heterogeneous behavioral change of the Shanghai population to the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 outbreak and the effect of heterogenous behavior on the spread of COVID-19, both spatially and demographically. These findings could be instrumental for the design of targeted interventions for the control and mitigation of future outbreaks of COVID-19, and, more broadly, of respiratory pathogens.","142":"BackgroundGiven its high economic and societal cost, policymakers might be reluctant to implement a large-scale lockdown in case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic rebound. They may consider it as a last resort option if alternative control measures fail to reduce transmission.AimWe developed a modelling framework to ascertain the use of lockdown to ensure intensive care unit (ICU) capacity does not exceed a peak target defined by policymakers.MethodsWe used a deterministic compartmental model describing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the trajectories of COVID-19 patients in healthcare settings, accounting for age-specific mixing patterns and an increasing probability of severe outcomes with age. The framework is illustrated in the context of metropolitan France.ResultsThe daily incidence of ICU admissions and the number of occupied ICU beds are the most robust indicators to decide when a lockdown should be triggered. When the doubling time of hospitalisations estimated before lockdown is between 8 and 20 days, lockdown should be enforced when ICU admissions reach 3.0-3.7 and 7.8-9.5 per million for peak targets of 62 and 154 ICU beds per million (4,000 and 10,000 beds for metropolitan France), respectively. When implemented earlier, the lockdown duration required to get back below a desired level is also shorter.ConclusionsWe provide simple indicators and triggers to decide if and when a last-resort lockdown should be implemented to avoid saturation of ICU. These metrics can support the planning and real-time management of successive COVID-19 pandemic waves.","143":"Vaccines have reduced severe disease and death from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, with evidence of waning efficacy coupled with continued evolution of the virus, health programmes need to evaluate the requirement for regular booster doses, considering their impact and cost-effectiveness in the face of ongoing transmission and substantial infection-induced immunity.Our modelling suggests that regular boosting of the high-risk population remains an important tool to reduce morbidity and mortality from current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our results suggest that focusing vaccination in the highest-risk cohorts will be the most efficient (and hence cost-effective) strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality.We developed a combined immunological-transmission model parameterised with data on transmissibility, severity, and vaccine effectiveness. We simulated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and vaccine rollout in characteristic global settings with different population age-structures, contact patterns, health system capacities, prior transmission, and vaccine uptake. We quantified the impact of future vaccine booster dose strategies with both ancestral and variant-adapted vaccine products, while considering the potential future emergence of new variants with modified transmission, immune escape, and severity properties. We found that regular boosting of the oldest age group (75+) is an efficient strategy, although large numbers of hospitalisations and deaths could be averted by extending vaccination to younger age groups. In countries with low vaccine coverage and high infection-derived immunity, boosting older at-risk groups was more effective than continuing primary vaccination into younger ages in our model. Our study is limited by uncertainty in key parameters, including the long-term durability of vaccine and infection-induced immunity as well as uncertainty in the future evolution of the virus.","144":"Apes possess two sex chromosomes-the male-specific Y chromosome and the X chromosome, which is present in both males and females. The Y chromosome is crucial for male reproduction, with deletions being linked to infertility1. The X chromosome is vital for reproduction and cognition2. Variation in mating patterns and brain function among apes suggests corresponding differences in their sex chromosomes. However, owing to their repetitive nature and incomplete reference assemblies, ape sex chromosomes have been challenging to study. Here, using the methodology developed for the telomere-to-telomere (T2T) human genome, we produced gapless assemblies of the X and Y chromosomes for five great apes (bonobo (Pan paniscus), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), western lowland\u00a0gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) and Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii)) and a lesser ape (the siamang gibbon (Symphalangus syndactylus)), and untangled the intricacies of their evolution. Compared with the X chromosomes, the ape Y chromosomes vary greatly in size and have low alignability and high levels of structural rearrangements-owing to the accumulation of lineage-specific ampliconic regions, palindromes, transposable elements and satellites. Many Y chromosome genes expand in multi-copy families and some evolve under purifying selection. Thus, the Y chromosome exhibits dynamic evolution, whereas the X chromosome is more stable. Mapping short-read sequencing data to these assemblies revealed diversity and selection patterns on sex chromosomes of more than 100 individual great apes. These reference assemblies are expected to inform human evolution and conservation genetics of non-human apes, all of which are endangered species.","145":"While human users are often considered to be the weakest link in security systems, the risks associated with their typical day-to-day computing habits are not well understood. Using Symantec\u0092s WINE platform, we conduct a detailed study of 13.7B pieces of malware over a population of 1.6 million machines during an 8-month period in order to learn the relationship between user behavior and cyber-attacks against their personal computers. We classify users into four categories (gamers, professionals, software developers, others plus a fifth category comprising everyone) and identify a total of seven independent variables to study: (i) number of binaries (executables) on a machine, (ii) fraction of low-prevalence binaries on a machine, (iii) fraction of high-prevalence binaries on a machine, (iv) fraction of unique binaries on a machine, (v) fraction of downloaded binaries on a machine, (vi) fraction of unsigned binaries on a machine and (vii) travel history of the machine based on number of ISPs from whom the machine connected to the Internet.","146":"The population cohort included 48,301 participants. Baseline HIV prevalence was 21% or 22% in each group. Between months 12 and 36, a total of 553 new HIV infections were observed during 39,702 person-years (1.4 per 100 person-years; women, 1.7; men, 0.8). The adjusted rate ratio for group A as compared with group C was 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 1.18; P\u2009=\u20090.51) and for group B as compared with group C was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.55 to 0.88; P\u2009=\u20090.006). The percentage of HIV-positive participants with viral suppression at 24 months was 71.9% in group A, 67.5% in group B, and 60.2% in group C. The estimated percentage of HIV-positive adults in the community who were receiving ART at 36 months was 81% in group A and 80% in group B.A universal testing and treatment strategy is a potential approach to reduce the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, yet previous trial results are inconsistent.In the HPTN 071 (PopART) community-randomized trial conducted from 2013 through 2018, we randomly assigned 21 communities in Zambia and South Africa (total population, approximately 1 million) to group A (combination prevention intervention with universal antiretroviral therapy [ART]), group B (the prevention intervention with ART provided according to local guidelines [universal since 2016]), or group C (standard care). The prevention intervention included home-based HIV testing delivered by community workers, who also supported linkage to HIV care and ART adherence. The primary outcome, HIV incidence between months 12 and 36, was measured in a population cohort of approximately 2000 randomly sampled adults (18 to 44 years of age) per community. Viral suppression (<400 copies of HIV RNA per milliliter) was assessed in all HIV-positive participants at 24 months.A combination prevention intervention with ART provided according to local guidelines resulted in a 30% lower incidence of HIV infection than standard care. The lack of effect with universal ART was unanticipated and not consistent with the data on viral suppression. In this trial setting, universal testing and treatment reduced the population-level incidence of HIV infection.

Healthcare workers with negative SARS-CoV-2 IgM\/IgG test were randomly assigned to: daily TDF\/FTC plus HCQ for 12\u00a0weeks, TDF\/FTC plus HCQ placebo, HCQ plus TDF\/FTC placebo and TDF\/FTC placebo plus HCQ placebo. Randomization was performed in groups of four. Primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19. We also studied any (symptomatic or asymptomatic) COVID-19. We compared group-specific 14-week risks via differences and ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI).Of 1002 individuals screened, 926 (92.4%) were eligible and there were 14 cases of symptomatic COVID-19: 220 were assigned to the TDF\/FTC plus HCQ group (3 cases), 231 to the TDF\/FTC placebo plus HCQ group (3 cases), 233 to the TDF\/FTC plus HCQ placebo group (3 cases), and 223 to the double placebo group (5 cases).

Five persistence models representing first-order decay and nonlinear decay profiles were fit to a comprehensive database of 629 data sets for fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), bacteriophages, bacteria, viruses, and protozoa mined from the literature. Initial periods of minimal decay and decay rates tapering off over time were often observed, and a two-parameter model, based on the logistic probability distribution, provided the best fit to the data most frequently. First-order decay kinetics provided the best fit to less than 20% of the analyzed data. Using the best fitting models in this analysis, T90 and T99 metrics were calculated for each data set and used as the dependent variable in a variety of exploratory factor analyses. Random forest methods identified temperature and predation as some of the most important water quality factors influencing persistence, and the protozoa target type differed the most from FIB. This analysis further confirmed the interactions between temperature and predation and suggests that pH and turbidity be more frequently documented in persistence studies to further elucidate their impact on target persistence. The findings from this analysis and the calculated persistence metrics can be used to better inform quantitative microbial risk assessments and may lead to improved predictions of human health risks and water management decisions.","151":") where copy number never returns to the ancestral state, there is evidence of mRNA splicing, and no common gene-disruptive mutations are observed in the general population.

One way to quantify potential harm to the fetus in the first trimester is to measure a corollary effect on the placenta. Placental biomarkers are widely present in maternal circulation, cord blood, and placental tissue biopsied at birth or at the time of pregnancy termination. Here we evaluate ten diverse pathways involving molecules expressed in the first trimester human placenta based on their relevance to normal fetal development and to the hypothesis of placental-fetal endocrine disruption (perturbation in development that results in abnormal endocrine function in the offspring), namely: human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), thyroid hormone regulation, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor protein gamma (PPAR\u03b3), leptin, transforming growth factor beta, epiregulin, growth differentiation factor 15, small nucleolar RNAs, serotonin, and vitamin D. Some of these are well-established as biomarkers of placental-fetal endocrine disruption, while others are not well studied and were selected based on discovery analyses of the placental transcriptome. A literature search on these biomarkers summarizes evidence of placenta-specific production and regulation of each biomarker, and their role in fetal reproductive tract, brain, and other specific domains of fetal development. In this review, we extend the theory of fetal programming to placental-fetal programming.","153":"The COVID-19 pandemic has created a public health crisis. Because SARS-CoV-2 can spread from individuals with pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, and asymptomatic infections, the re-opening of societies and the control of virus spread will be facilitated by robust population screening, for which virus testing will often be central. After infection, individuals undergo a period of incubation during which viral titers are usually too low to detect, followed by an exponential viral growth, leading to a peak viral load and infectiousness, and ending with declining viral levels and clearance. Given the pattern of viral load kinetics, we model the effectiveness of repeated population screening considering test sensitivities, frequency, and sample-to-answer reporting time. These results demonstrate that effective screening depends largely on frequency of testing and the speed of reporting, and is only marginally improved by high test sensitivity. We therefore conclude that screening should prioritize accessibility, frequency, and sample-to-answer time; analytical limits of detection should be secondary.","154":"Rubella vaccine has yet to be introduced into the national immunization schedule of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC); the current burden of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is unknown and likely to be high. An important consideration prior to introducing rubella containing vaccine (RCV) is the potential inverse relationship between RCV coverage and CRS incidence. Increasing RCV coverage will also increase in the average age of infection. Cumulative infections across all age groups will decrease, but the number of infections in age groups vulnerable to CRS may increase.Rubella transmission dynamics in the DRC were simulated using a stochastic agent-based model of transmission. Input parameter values for known properties, demographic variables, and interventions were fixed; infectivity was inferred from seropositivity profiles in survey data. vaccination coverage and high mean CRS burden, which have more consistent burden from year to year.Our simulations of RCV introduction for the DRC demonstrate that an increase in CRS burden is unlikely. Continued endemic transmission is only plausible when routine immunization coverage is less than 40% and follow-up supplemental immunization activities have poor coverage for decades.","155":"This cross-sectional study obtained data on 620 distinct ACOs from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Shared Savings Program Accountable Care Organizations Public-Use Files from April 1, 2012, to September 30, 2017. Generalized estimating equation models were used for analysis of ACOs, adjusting for ACO-beneficiary health status, Medicare enrollment groups, ACO size, and proportion of participating specialists.The primary outcome was total expenditures (given in US dollars) per assigned beneficiary person-year. The secondary outcomes were total numbers of emergency department visits, hospital discharges, skilled nursing facility discharges, and magnetic resonance imaging orders.In total, the data set included 1836 ACO-year (number of participation years per ACO) observations for 620 distinct ACOs. Those ACOs with a specialist encounter proportion of 40% to less than 45% had $1129 (95% CI, $445-$1814) lower per-beneficiary person-year spending than did ACOs in the lowest specialist encounter proportion group and had $752 (95% CI, $115-$1389) lower per-beneficiary person-year spending compared with ACOs in the highest specialist encounter proportion group. Monotonic decreases in emergency department visits, hospital discharges, and skilled nursing facility discharges were observed with increasing specialist encounter proportion. Conversely, monotonic increases in magnetic resonance imaging volume discharges were observed with increasing specialist encounter proportion.Accountable care organizations (ACOs) aim to control health expenditures while improving quality of care. Primary care has been emphasized as a means to reduce spending, but little is known about the implications of using specialists for achieving this ACO objective.These findings suggest that an ACO's ability to reduce spending may require sufficient involvement in care processes from specialists, who seem to complement the intrinsic primary care approach in ACOs.Specialist encounter proportion, the percentage of office visits provided by a specialist, was categorized into 7 discrete groups: less than 35%, 35% to less than 40%, 40% to less than 45% (reference group), 45% to less than 50%, 50% to less than 55%, 55% to less than 60%, and 60% or greater.To examine the association between ACO-beneficiary office visits conducted by specialists and the cost and utilization outcomes of those visits.","156":"We investigated the association between temperature and human contact patterns using data collected through a cross-sectional diary-based contact survey in Shanghai, China, between December 24, 2017, and May 30, 2018. We then developed a compartmental model of influenza transmission informed by the derived seasonal trends in the number of contacts and validated it against A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza data collected in Shanghai during the same period.Human contact patterns are a key determinant driving the spread of respiratory infectious diseases. However, the relationship between contact patterns and seasonality as well as their possible association with the seasonality of respiratory diseases is yet to be clarified.We identified a significant inverse relationship between the number of contacts and the seasonal temperature trend defined as a spline interpolation of temperature data (p\u2009=\u20090.003). We estimated an average of 16.4 (95% PrI: 15.1-17.5) contacts per day in December 2017 that increased to an average of 17.6 contacts (95% PrI: 16.5-19.3) in January 2018 and then declined to an average of 10.3 (95% PrI: 9.4-10.8) in May 2018. Estimates of influenza incidence obtained by the compartmental model comply with the observed epidemiological data. The reproduction number was estimated to increase from 1.24 (95% CI: 1.21-1.27) in December to a peak of 1.34 (95% CI: 1.31-1.37) in January. The estimated median infection attack rate at the end of the season was 27.4% (95% CI: 23.7-30.5%).Our findings support a relationship between temperature and contact patterns, which can contribute to deepen the understanding of the relationship between social interactions and the epidemiology of respiratory infectious diseases.","157":"Neuroinflammation can cause major neurological dysfunction, without demyelination, in both multiple sclerosis (MS) and a mouse model of the disease (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; EAE), but the mechanisms remain obscure. Confocal in vivo imaging of the mouse EAE spinal cord reveals that impaired neurological function correlates with the depolarisation of both the axonal mitochondria and the axons themselves. Indeed, the depolarisation parallels the expression of neurological deficit at the onset of disease, and during relapse, improving during remission in conjunction with the deficit. Mitochondrial dysfunction, fragmentation and impaired trafficking were most severe in regions of extravasated perivascular inflammatory cells. The dysfunction at disease onset was accompanied by increased expression of the rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase-2 in activated astrocytes, and by selective reduction in spinal mitochondrial complex I activity. The metabolic changes preceded any demyelination or axonal degeneration. We conclude that mitochondrial dysfunction is a major cause of reversible neurological deficits in neuroinflammatory disease, such as MS.","158":"Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Medical Research Council, and the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office.For seven NTDs, namely soil-transmitted helminths, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, trachoma, visceral leishmaniasis, and human African trypanosomiasis, we used mathematical transmission models to simulate the effect of programme interruptions on the dynamics of each of these diseases in different endemic settings. We also explored the potential benefit of implementing mitigation strategies, primarily in terms of minimising the delays to control targets.The COVID-19 pandemic has brought infectious disease control to the forefront of global consciousness. It is essential that the NTDs, so long neglected in terms of research and financial support, are not overlooked, and remain a priority in health service planning and funding.We show that the effect of the COVID-19-induced interruption in terms of delay to achieving elimination goals might in some cases be much longer than the duration of the interruption. For schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis, trachoma, and visceral leishmaniasis, a mean delay of 2-3 years for a 1-year interruption is predicted in areas of highest prevalence. We also show that these delays can largely be mitigated by measures such as additional mass drug administration or enhanced case-finding.In line with movement restrictions and physical distancing essential for the control of the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO recommended postponement of all neglected tropical disease (NTD) control activities that involve community-based surveys, active case finding, and mass drug administration in April, 2020. Following revised guidance later in 2020, and after interruptions to NTD programmes of varying lengths, NTD programmes gradually restarted in the context of an ongoing pandemic. However, ongoing challenges and service gaps have been reported. This study aimed to evaluate the potential effect of the programmatic interruptions and strategies to mitigate this effect.","159":"A cluster randomized, parallel arm, superiority trial conducted in two settings with distinct eco-epidemiological conditions in East and Southern Africa.

We assayed for levels of measles IgG antibody (717, 233 and 75 sample sera tested at months 0, 3 and 6, respectively), and neutralizing antibodies for EV71 and CoxA16 (225, 217, and 72). Demographic and health information were collected, and a linear mixed model (LMM) was used to describe antibody levels over time.Due to waning levels of maternal antibodies (measles; enterovirus 71, EV71; and coxsackievirus A16, CoxA16), some infants may lose protection against infection prior to vaccination. Using a longitudinal design, we examine how maternal antibody levels evolve over time in infants prior to vaccination.Further modifications of vaccination strategies for measles, earlier vaccination for EV71 infection, and deployment of a CoxA16 vaccine need to be considered to limit infection among the very young.Pre-vaccination monotonic antibody decreases were observed for measles (1410, 195 and 22mIU\/ml, p<0.001), EV71 (1:19.9, 6.3 and 4.5, p<0.001) and CoxA16 (1:16.3, 5.9, and 4.5, p<0.001).

We validated the chip using laboratory single-pair crosses, comparing technical replicates, and comparing genotypes of samples genotyped by WGS and the SNP chip. We then used the chip for a population genomic analysis of 237 samples from 28 sites in the native range to evaluate its usefulness in describing patterns of genomic variation and tracing the origins of invasions.Probes on the Aealbo chip targeted 175,396 SNPs in coding and non-coding regions across all three chromosomes, with a density of 102 SNPs per 1\u00a0Mb window, and at least one SNP in each of the 17,461 protein-coding genes. Overall, 70% of the probes captured the genetic variation. Segregation analysis found that 98% of the SNPs followed expectations of single-copy Mendelian genes. Comparisons with WGS indicated that sites with genotype disagreements were mostly heterozygotes at loci with WGS read depth\u2009\u200920, indicating that the chip more accurately detects heterozygotes than low-coverage WGS. Sample sizes did not affect the accuracy of the SNP chip genotype calls. Ancestry analyses identified four to five genetic clusters in the native range with various levels of admixture.Although whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is the preferred genotyping method for most genomic analyses, limitations are often experienced when studying genomes characterized by a high percentage of repetitive elements, high linkage, and recombination deserts. The Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus), for example, has a genome comprising up to 72% repetitive elements, and therefore we set out to develop a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip to be more cost-effective. Aedes albopictus is an invasive species originating from Southeast Asia that has recently spread around the world and is a vector for many human diseases. Developing an accessible genotyping platform is essential in advancing biological control methods and understanding the population dynamics of this pest species, with significant implications for public health.","162":" is associated with elevated term low birth weight risk in selected weeks and counties and that ignoring spatial variability results in null associations during these periods.

Despite high vaccination coverage, countries such as Australia, USA, and UK have experienced increase in pertussis activity over the last few decades. This may be due to local pockets of low vaccination coverage that result in persistence of pertussis in the population and occasionally lead to large outbreaks. The objective of this study was to characterize the association between pertussis vaccination coverage and sociodemographic factors and pertussis incidence at the school district level in King County, Washington, USA. We used monthly pertussis incidence data for all ages reported to the Public Health Seattle and King County between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2017 to obtain school district level pertussis incidence. We obtained immunization data from the Washington State Immunization Information System to estimate school-district level vaccination coverage as proportion of 19-35 month old children fully vaccinated with \u22654 doses of the Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular-Pertussis (DTaP) vaccine in a school district. We used two methods to quantify the effects of vaccination coverage on pertussis incidence: an ecological vaccine model and an endemic-epidemic model. Even though the effect of vaccination is modeled differently in the two approaches, both models can be used to estimate the association between vaccination coverage and pertussis incidence. Using the ecological vaccine model, we estimated the vaccine effectiveness of 4 doses of Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular-Pertussis vaccine to be 83% (95% credible interval: 63%, 95%). In the endemic-epidemic model, under-vaccination was statistically significantly associated with epidemic risk of pertussis (adjusted Relative Risk, aRR: 2.76; 95% confidence interval: 1.44, 16.6). Household size and median income were statistically significantly associated with endemic pertussis risk. The endemic-epidemic model suffers from ecological bias, whereas the ecological vaccine model provides less biased and more interpretable estimates of epidemiological parameters, such as DTaP vaccine effectiveness, for each school district.","164":"We used annual rates of age- and cause-specific deaths to estimate pandemic-related mortality in excess of background levels in 39 countries in Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and the Americas. We modeled the relationship between excess mortality and development indicators to extrapolate the global burden of the pandemic.The global mortality rate of the 1957-1959 influenza pandemic was moderate relative to that of the 1918 pandemic but was approximately 10-fold greater than that of the 2009 pandemic. The impact of the pandemic on mortality was delayed in several countries, pointing to a window of opportunity for vaccination in a future pandemic.Quantitative estimates of the global burden of the 1957 influenza pandemic are lacking. Here we fill this gap by modeling historical mortality statistics.The pandemic-associated excess respiratory mortality rate was 1.9\/10,000 population (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.6 cases\/10,000 population) on average during 1957-1959. Excess mortality rates varied 70-fold across countries; Europe and Latin America experienced the lowest and highest rates, respectively. Excess mortality was delayed by 1-2 years in 18 countries (46%). Increases in the mortality rate relative to baseline were greatest in school-aged children and young adults, with no evidence that elderly population was spared from excess mortality. Development indicators were moderate predictors of excess mortality, explaining 35%-77% of the variance. Overall, we attribute 1.1 million excess deaths (95% CI, .7 million-1.5 million excess deaths) globally to the 1957-1959 pandemic.","165":"We investigated the value of autoantibodies as biomarkers of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) by analyzing the autoantibody profiles of 65 patients (34 cGVHD and 31 non-cGVHD) surviving longer than three months after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Autoantibodies to at least one antigen were detected in 45 patients (70.8%), with multiple autoantibodies detected in 30 patients (46.2%). Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) were the most frequently detected autoantibodies, with a significantly higher prevalence in non-cGVHD patients and cGVHD patients than that in healthy controls (HCs). ANA-nucleolar (ANA-N) was the main immunofluorescence pattern of ANA-positivity in both the non-cGVHD and cGVHD groups. There was a higher prevalence of anti-Ro52-positivity in non-cGVHD and cGVHD patients than in HC. Liver cGVHD was significantly associated with anti-Ro52-positivity. However, cGVHD activity and severity were not associated with the presence of autoantibodies. Similarly, there were no significant differences in overall survival or relapse among the four groups of patients expressing autoantibodies. Our results suggest that autoantibodies have limited value in predicting cGVHD.","166":"Despite the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects remain a global challenge including the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region. Knowledge of the COVID-19 dynamics and its potential trends amidst variations in COVID-19 vaccine coverage is therefore crucial for policy makers in the SSA region where vaccine uptake is generally lower than in high-income countries. Using a compartmental epidemiological model, this study aims to forecast the potential COVID-19 trends and determine how long a wave could be, taking into consideration the current vaccination rates. The model is calibrated using South African reported data for the first four waves of COVID-19, and the data for the fifth wave are used to test the validity of the model forecast. The model is qualitatively analysed by determining equilibria and their stability, calculating the basic reproduction number R0 and investigating the local and global sensitivity analysis with respect to R0. The impact of vaccination and control interventions are investigated via a series of numerical simulations. Based on the fitted data and simulations, we observed that massive vaccination would only be beneficial (deaths averting) if a highly effective vaccine is used, particularly in combination with non-pharmaceutical interventions. Furthermore, our forecasts demonstrate that increased vaccination coverage in SSA increases population immunity leading to low daily infection numbers in potential future waves. Our findings could be helpful in guiding policy makers and governments in designing vaccination strategies and the implementation of other COVID-19 mitigation strategies.","167":"Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) threatens progress in the control of TB. Mathematical models are increasingly being used to guide public health decisions on managing both antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and TB. It is important to consider bacterial heterogeneity in models as it can have consequences for predictions of resistance prevalence, which may affect decision-making. We conducted a systematic review of published mathematical models to determine the modelling landscape and to explore methods for including bacterial heterogeneity. Our first objective was to identify and analyse the general characteristics of mathematical models of DR-mycobacteria, including M. tuberculosis. The second objective was to analyse methods of including bacterial heterogeneity in these models. We had different definitions of heterogeneity depending on the model level. For between-host models of mycobacterium, heterogeneity was defined as any model where bacteria of the same resistance level were further differentiated. For bacterial population models, heterogeneity was defined as having multiple distinct resistant populations. The search was conducted following PRISMA guidelines in five databases, with studies included if they were mechanistic or simulation models of DR-mycobacteria. We identified 195 studies modelling DR-mycobacteria, with most being dynamic transmission models of non-treatment intervention impact in M. tuberculosis (n = 58). Studies were set in a limited number of specific countries, and 44% of models (n = 85) included only a single level of \"multidrug-resistance (MDR)\". Only 23 models (8 between-host) included any bacterial heterogeneity. Most of these also captured multiple antibiotic-resistant classes (n = 17), but six models included heterogeneity in bacterial populations resistant to a single antibiotic. Heterogeneity was usually represented by different fitness values for bacteria resistant to the same antibiotic (61%, n = 14). A large and growing body of mathematical models of DR-mycobacterium is being used to explore intervention impact to support policy as well as theoretical explorations of resistance dynamics. However, the majority lack bacterial heterogeneity, suggesting that important evolutionary effects may be missed.","168":"Improved HDV testing and surveillance are crucial for early detection and implementation of targeted therapies.Analysis of HDV\/HBV testing, diagnostic codes, liver enzymes, and comorbidities was performed.This study assessed the epidemiology of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) within the University of Utah UHealth health care system (2000-2021).Among the 1962 HBV patients, only 22.2% underwent HDV testing, revealing an 8.3% positivity rate for HDV coinfections. This study observed a consistent increase in HBV and HDV cases, with higher HDV detection rates linked to increased testing. Limited HDV testing and potential screening biases were evident.","169":"In this prospective household cohort study, we recruited children born after Sept 17, 2012, and aged at least 6 weeks (vaccine-eligible children) with acute rotavirus gastroenteritis and their household contacts, in four government health facilities in Blantyre, Malawi. Clinical data, a bulk stool sample, and 1-2 mL of serum were collected from case children at presentation. Clinical data and stool samples were also prospectively collected from household contacts over 14 days from presentation. A single stool sample was collected from control households containing asymptomatic children who were frequency age-matched to case children. Samples were tested for rotavirus using semi-quantitative real-time PCR and for anti-rotavirus IgA using a semi-quantitative sandwich ELISA. Risk factors for household transmission of rotavirus infection and clinical disease, including disease severity and faecal shedding density, were identified using mixed effects logistic regression. Vaccine effectiveness against transmission was estimated as 1 minus the ratio of secondary attack rates in vaccinated and counterfactual unvaccinated populations, using vaccine effectiveness estimates from the associated diarrhoeal surveillance platform to estimate the counterfactual secondary attack rate without vaccination.Wellcome Trust, US National Institutes of Health, and US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Rotavirus vaccine has the potential to substantially reduce household rotavirus transmission. This finding should be considered in clinical and health economic assessments of vaccine effectiveness.Rotavirus vaccine effectiveness is reduced among children in low-income countries. Indirect (transmission-mediated) effects of rotavirus vaccine might contribute to the total population effect of vaccination. We aimed to examine risk factors for transmission of rotavirus to household contacts in Blantyre, Malawi, and estimated the effectiveness of rotavirus vaccine in preventing transmission of infection to household contacts.Between Feb 16, 2015, and Nov 11, 2016, we recruited 196 case households (705 members) and 55 control households (153 members). Household secondary attack rate for rotavirus infection was high (434 [65%] of 665 individuals) and secondary attack rate for clinical disease was much lower (37 [5%] of 698). Asymptomatic infection in control households was common (40 [28%] of 144). Increasing disease severity in an index child (as measured by Vesikari score) was associated with increased risk of transmission of infection (odds ratio 1\u00b717 [95% CI 1\u00b706-1\u00b730) and disease (1\u00b728 [1\u00b708-1\u00b752]) to household contacts.

The role of biological sex in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is believed to explain this sex disparity. However, the contribution of gender factors that influence health protective behaviors and therefore health outcomes, remains poorly explored.We assessed the contributions of gender in attitudes towards the COVID-19 pandemic, using a hypothetical influenza pandemic data from the 2019 Taiwan Social Change Survey. Participants were selected through a stratified, three-stage probability proportional-to-size sampling from across the nation, to fill in questionnaires that asked about their perception of the hypothetical pandemic, and intention to adopt health protective behaviors.This study unveils gender differences in risk perception, health protective behaviors, vaccine hesitancy, and compliance with contact-tracing using a hypothetical viral pandemic. Gender-specific health education raising awareness of health protective behaviors may be beneficial to prevent future pandemics.","171":"Two novel reassortant avian influenza A (H3N6) viruses were isolated from swan goose in Poyang Lake, Jiangxi Province, China, in 2014. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that these viruses are most likely derived from the Eurasian-originated H3Ny (N3, N6, N8) and H5N6 viruses circulating among wild and domestic birds. It is noteworthy that H9N2 viruses have contributed PB1 gene to these novel H3N6 viruses. Our findings provide phylogenetic evidence to elucidate the ongoing viral reassortment in the wild bird population in southern China. Active surveillance of avian influenza viruses in Poyang Lake is warranted.","172":"Motivated by the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China, we use a global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic. The model is calibrated on the basis of internationally reported cases and shows that, at the start of the travel ban from Wuhan on 23 January 2020, most Chinese cities had already received many infected travelers. The travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in mainland China but had a more marked effect on the international scale, where case importations were reduced by nearly 80% until mid-February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.","173":"Understanding temporal and spatial dynamics of malaria transmission will help to inform effective interventions and strategies in regions approaching elimination. Parasite genomics are increasingly used to monitor epidemiologic trends, including assessing residual transmission across seasons and importation of malaria into these regions.Leveraging both genomic and epidemiological data provided comprehensive picture of fluctuations in parasite populations in this pre-elimination setting of southern Zambia over 7\u00a0years.In a low and seasonal transmission setting of southern Zambia, a total of 441 Plasmodium falciparum samples collected from 8 neighbouring health centres between 2012 and 2018 were genotyped using molecular inversion probes (MIPs n\u2009=\u20091793) targeting a total of 1832 neutral and geographically informative SNPs distributed across the parasite genome. After filtering for quality and missingness, 302 samples and 1410 SNPs were retained and used for downstream population genomic analyses.The analyses revealed most (67%, n\u2009=\u2009202) infections harboured one clone (monogenomic) with some variation at local level suggesting low, but heterogenous malaria transmission. Relatedness identity-by-descent (IBD) analysis revealed variable distribution of IBD segments across the genome and 6% of pairs were highly-related (IBD\u2009\u2265\u20090.25). Some of the highly-related parasite populations persisted across multiple seasons, suggesting that persistence of malaria in this low-transmission region is fueled by parasites \"seeding\" across the dry season. For recent years, clusters of clonal parasites were identified that were dissimilar to the general parasite population, suggesting parasite populations were increasingly fragmented at small spatial scales due to intensified control efforts. Clustering analysis using PCA and t-SNE showed a lack of substantial parasite population structure.","174":"Freshwater systems are critical to life on earth, yet they are threatened by the increasing rate of synthetic chemical pollution. Current predictions of the effects of synthetic chemicals on freshwater ecosystems are hampered by the sheer number of chemical contaminants entering aquatic systems, the diversity of organisms inhabiting these systems, the myriad possible direct and indirect effects resulting from these combinations, and uncertainties concerning how contaminants might alter ecosystem metabolism via changes in biodiversity. To address these knowledge gaps, we conducted a mesocosm experiment that elucidated the responses of ponds composed of phytoplankton and zooplankton to standardized concentrations of 12 pesticides, nested within four pesticide classes, and two pesticide types. We show that the effects of the pesticides on algae were consistent within herbicides and insecticides and that responses of over 70 phytoplankton species and genera were consistent within broad taxonomic groups. Insecticides generated top-down effects on phytoplankton community composition and abundance, which were associated with persistent increases in ecosystem respiration. Insecticides had direct toxic effects on cladocerans, which led to competitive release of copepods. These changes in the zooplankton community led to a decrease in green algae and a modest increase in diatoms. Herbicides did not change phytoplankton composition but reduced total phytoplankton abundance. This reduction in phytoplankton led to short-term decreases in ecosystem respiration. Given that ponds release atmospheric carbon and that worldwide pesticide pollution continues to increase exponentially, scientists and policy makers should pay more attention to the ways pesticides alter the carbon cycle in ponds via changes in communities, as demonstrated by our results. Our results show that these predictions can be simplified by grouping pesticides into types and species into functional groups. Adopting this approach provides an opportunity to improve the efficiency of risk assessment and mitigation responses to global change.","175":"Adverse lifestyle factors increase risk of anxiety and depression in young adults. Consequently, neurochemical and neuroanatomical alterations ensue, and may initiate a vicious cycle of mental distress, poor lifestyle choices and academic performance. A total of 558 students from different US colleges completed an anonymous survey on academic performance, daytime sleepiness, substance use and mental distress. Low mental distress in college students positively associated with good academic efforts and limited daytime sleepiness. Mild mental distress correlated with borderline work neglect and with a marginal negative association with Grade-point average (GPA). Severe mental distress correlated with excessive daytime sleepiness and poor academic performance. A System Dynamic model was developed to reflect the integration of these variables with mental distress and academic performance. Our results demonstrate that manageable lifestyle factors contribute to mental health in college students, which become potentially cyclic events that may impact academic performance.","176":"Variation in free-living microparasite survival can have a meaningful impact on the ecological dynamics of established and emerging infectious diseases. Nevertheless, resolving the importance of indirect and environmental transmission in the ecology of epidemics remains a persistent challenge. It requires accurately measuring the free-living survival of pathogens across reservoirs of various kinds and quantifying the extent to which interaction between hosts and reservoirs generates new infections. These questions are especially salient for emerging pathogens, where sparse and noisy data can obfuscate the relative contribution of different infection routes. In this study, we develop a mechanistic, mathematical model that permits both direct (host-to-host) and indirect (environmental) transmission and then fit this model to empirical data from 17 countries affected by an emerging virus (SARS-CoV-2). From an ecological perspective, our model highlights the potential for environmental transmission to drive complex, nonlinear dynamics during infectious disease outbreaks. Summarizing, we propose that fitting alternative models with indirect transmission to real outbreak data from SARS-CoV-2 can be useful, as it highlights that indirect mechanisms may play an underappreciated role in the dynamics of infectious diseases, with implications for public health.","177":"Despite the sparse distribution of meteorological stations and issues with missing data, vector-borne disease studies in Ethiopia have been commonly conducted based on the relationships between these diseases and ground-based in situ measurements of climate variation. High temporal and spatial resolution satellite-based remote-sensing data is a potential alternative to address this problem. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of daily gridded temperature and rainfall datasets obtained from satellite remote sensing or spatial interpolation of ground-based observations in relation to data from 22 meteorological stations in Amhara Region, Ethiopia, for 2003-2016. Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS-Net) Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS) interpolated temperature showed the lowest bias (mean error (ME) \u22481-3 \u00b0C), and error (mean absolute error (MAE) \u22481-3 \u00b0C), and the highest correlation with day-to-day variability of station temperature (COR \u22480.7-0.8). In contrast, temperature retrievals from the blended Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on Earth Observing Satellite (AMSR-E) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) passive microwave and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land-surface temperature data had higher bias and error. Climate Hazards group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) rainfall showed the least bias and error (ME \u2248-0.2-0.2 mm, MAE \u22480.5-2 mm), and the best agreement (COR \u22480.8), with station rainfall data. In contrast FLDAS had the higher bias and error and the lowest agreement and Global Precipitation Mission\/Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (GPM\/TRMM) data were intermediate. This information can inform the selection of geospatial data products for use in climate and disease research and applications.","178":" had the highest likelihood of positive antibodies; these two classes differed in their masking intentions, but shared very low likelihoods of physical distancing from others and avoiding crowds or mass gatherings.

Computer scientists, data scientists, physicists and mathematicians have joined public health professionals and virologists to confront the largest pandemic in the century by capitalizing on the large-scale 'big data' generated and harnessed for combating the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we review the newly born data science approaches to confronting COVID-19, including the estimation of epidemiological parameters, digital contact tracing, diagnosis, policy-making, resource allocation, risk assessment, mental health surveillance, social media analytics, drug repurposing and drug development. We compare the new approaches with conventional epidemiological studies, discuss lessons we learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlight opportunities and challenges of data science approaches to confronting future infectious disease epidemics. This article is part of the theme issue 'Data science approaches to infectious disease surveillance'.","180":"The recent advent of CRISPR and other molecular tools enabled the reconstruction of cell lineages based on induced DNA mutations and promises to solve the ones of more complex organisms. To date, no lineage reconstruction algorithms have been rigorously examined for their performance and robustness across dataset types and number of cells. To benchmark such methods, we decided to organize a DREAM challenge using in\u00a0vitro experimental intMEMOIR recordings and in silico data for a C.\u00a0elegans lineage tree of about 1,000 cells and a Mus musculus tree of 10,000 cells. Some of the 22 approaches submitted had excellent performance, but structural features of the trees prevented optimal reconstructions. Using smaller sub-trees as training sets proved to be a good approach for tuning algorithms to reconstruct larger trees. The simulation and reconstruction methods here generated delineate a potential way forward for solving larger cell lineage trees such as in mouse.","181":"The predominance of H5N6 in ducks and continuous human cases have heightened its potential threat to public health in China. Therefore, the detection of emerging variants of H5N6 avian influenza viruses has become a priority for pandemic preparedness. Questions remain as to its origin and circulation within the wild bird reservoir and interactions at the wild-domestic interface. Samples were collected from migratory birds in Poyang Lake, Jiangxi Province, PR China during the routine bird ring survey in 2014-16. Phylogenetic and coalescent analyses were conducted to uncover the evolutionary relationship among viruses circulating in wild birds. Here, we report the potential origin and phylogenetic diversity of H5N6 viruses isolated from wild birds in Poyang Lake. Sequence analyses indicated that Jiangxi H5N6 viruses most likely evolved from Eurasian-derived H5Nx and H6N6 viruses through multiple reassortment events. Crucially, the diversity of the HA gene implies that these Jiangxi H5N6 viruses have diverged into two primary clades - clade 2.3.4.4 and clade 2.3.2.1\u2009c. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two independent pathways of reassortment during 2014-16 that might have facilitated the generation of emerging variants within wild bird populations as well as inter-species infections. Our findings contribute to our understanding of the genetic diversification of H5N6 viruses in the wild bird population. These results highlight the necessity of large-scale surveillance of wild birds in the Poyang Lake area to address the threat of regional epizootic epidemics and attendant pandemics.","182":"Viruses that infect bacteria, i.e., bacteriophage or 'phage,' are increasingly considered as treatment options for the control and clearance of bacterial infections, particularly as compassionate use therapy for multi-drug-resistant infections. In practice, clinical use of phage often involves the application of multiple therapeutic phage, either together or sequentially. However, the selection and timing of therapeutic phage delivery remains largely ad hoc. In this study, we evaluate principles underlying why careful application of multiple phage (i.e., a 'cocktail') might lead to therapeutic success in contrast to the failure of single-strain phage therapy to control an infection. First, we use a nonlinear dynamics model of within-host interactions to show that a combination of fast intra-host phage decay, evolution of phage resistance amongst bacteria, and\/or compromised immune response might limit the effectiveness of single-strain phage therapy. To resolve these problems, we combine dynamical modeling of phage, bacteria, and host immune cell populations with control-theoretic principles (via optimal control theory) to devise evolutionarily robust phage cocktails and delivery schedules to control the bacterial populations. Our numerical results suggest that optimal administration of single-strain phage therapy may be sufficient for curative outcomes in immunocompetent patients, but may fail in immunodeficient hosts due to phage resistance. We show that optimized treatment with a two-phage cocktail that includes a counter-resistant phage can restore therapeutic efficacy in immunodeficient hosts.","183":"Number of patients registered and randomised within 12 months of the trial opening to recruitment and incidence of breakthrough varicella.Children under 16 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer: currently or within 6 months of receiving cancer treatment and with negative varicella zoster virus (VZV) serostatus at diagnosis or within the last 3 months.ISRCTN48257441, EudraCT number: 2013-001332-22, sponsor: University of Birmingham.Given the limited recruitment to the PEPtalk2 pilot, it is unlikely that the necessary sample size would be achievable using this strategy in a full-scale trial. The study identified factors that could be used to modify the design of a definitive trial but other options for defining the best means to protect such children against VZV should be explored.The study opened in six sites over a 13-month period. 482 patients were screened for eligibility, 32 patients were registered and 3 patients were randomised following VZV exposure. All three were randomised to receive aciclovir and there were no cases of breakthrough varicella.England, UK.Multicentre pilot randomised controlled trial of VZIG and oral aciclovir.Study participants who have a significant VZV exposure were randomised to receive PEP in the form of VZIG or aciclovir after the exposure.To determine the likely rate of patient randomisation and to facilitate sample size calculation for a full-scale phase III trial of varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) and aciclovir as postexposure prophylaxis against chickenpox in children with cancer.","184":"In the Fall of 2020, university campuses in the United States resumed on-campus instruction and implemented wastewater monitoring for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) tests were deployed successfully to detect viral RNA in wastewater across campuses, the feasibility of detecting viral variants from a residential building like a dormitory was unclear. Here, we demonstrate that wastewater surveillance from a dormitory with at least three infected students could lead to the identification of viral genomes with more than 95% coverage. Our results indicate that viral variant detection from wastewater is achievable at a dormitory and that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) wastewater surveillance programs will benefit from the implementation of viral whole genome sequencing at universities.","185":"Antibiotics are a strong risk factor for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), and CDI incidence is often measured as an important outcome metric for antimicrobial stewardship interventions aiming to reduce antibiotic use. However, risk of CDI from antibiotics varies by agent and dependent on the intensity (i.e., spectrum and duration) of antibiotic therapy. Thus, the impact of stewardship interventions on CDI incidence is variable, and understanding this risk requires a more granular measure of intensity of therapy than traditionally used measures like days of therapy (DOT).We performed a retrospective cohort study to measure the independent association between intensity of antibiotic therapy, as measured by the antibiotic spectrum index (ASI), and hospital-associated CDI (HA-CDI) at a large academic medical center between January 2018 and March 2020. We constructed a marginal Poisson regression model to generate adjusted relative risks for a unit increase in ASI per antibiotic day.ASI was strongly associated with HA-CDI and could be a useful tool in evaluating the impact of antibiotic stewardship on HA-CDI rates, providing more granular information than the more commonly used days of therapy.We included 35,457 inpatient encounters in our cohort. Sixty-eight percent of patients received at least one antibiotic. We identified 128 HA-CDI cases, which corresponds to an incidence rate of 4.1 cases per 10,000 patient-days. After adjusting for known confounders, each additional unit increase in ASI per antibiotic day is associated with 1.09 times the risk of HA-CDI (Relative Risk = 1.09, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.06 to 1.13).","186":"Physical distancing measures aim to reduce person-to-person contact, a key driver of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In response to unprecedented restrictions on human contact during the COVID-19 pandemic, studies measured social contact patterns under the implementation of physical distancing measures. This rapid review synthesizes empirical data on the changing social contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic.We identified 12 studies reporting social contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eight studies were conducted in European countries and eleven collected data during the initial mitigation period in the spring of 2020 marked by government-declared lockdowns. Some studies collected additional data after relaxation of initial mitigation. Most study settings reported a mean of between 2-5 contacts per person per day, a substantial reduction compared to pre-COVID rates, which ranged from 7-26 contacts per day. This reduction was pronounced for contacts outside of the home. Consequently, levels of assortative mixing by age substantially declined. After relaxation of initial mitigation, mean contact rates increased but did not return to pre-COVID levels. Increases in contacts post-relaxation were driven by working-age adults.Information on changes in contact patterns during physical distancing measures can guide more realistic representations of contact patterns in mathematical models for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.We conducted a systematic review using PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We descriptively compared the distribution of contacts observed during the pandemic to pre-COVID data across countries to explore changes in contact patterns during physical distancing measures.","187":"Babesiosis is a potentially fatal tick-borne zoonotic disease caused by a species complex of blood parasites that can infect a variety of vertebrates, particularly dogs, cattle, and humans. In the United States, human babesiosis is caused by two distinct parasites, Babesia microti and Babesia duncani. The enzootic cycle of B. microti, endemic in the northeastern and upper midwestern regions, has been well characterised. In the western United States, however, the natural reservoir host and tick vector have not been identified for B. duncani, greatly impeding efforts to understand and manage this zoonotic disease. Two and a half decades after B. duncani was first described in a human patient in Washington State, USA, we provide evidence that the enzootic tick vector is the winter tick, Dermacentor albipictus, and the reservoir host is likely the mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus. The broad, overlapping ranges of these two species covers a large portion of far-western North America, and is consistent with confirmed cases of B. duncani in the far-western United States.","188":"We estimated 4.6 (95% uncertainty interval 3.4-5.8), 7.2 (5.1-9.6), and 18.0 (15.1-20.0) year reductions in life expectancy due to TB under prompt, delayed, and no treatment scenarios, respectively. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from TB were estimated as 8.3 (6.2-10.6), 12.6 (9.0-17.0), and 27.8 (24.1-30.6) under prompt, delayed, and no treatment scenarios, respectively. Post-TB DALYs represented 9-53% of total DALYs. Modelling approaches that omit progressive lung damage and post-TB sequelae underestimated lifetime health losses of TB by 48-57%, and underestimated the benefits of prompt treatment by 45-64%.Delayed initiation of TB treatment causes greater lung damage and higher mortality risks during and after the disease episode.

Conventional approaches for assessing TB health effects may not fully capture these mechanisms. We evaluated how TB-associated lung damage and post-TB sequalae affect the lifetime health consequences of TB in high HIV prevalence settings.We developed a microsimulation model representing dynamic changes in lung function for individuals evaluated for TB in routine clinical settings. We parameterized the model with data for Uganda, Kenya, and South Africa, and estimated lifetime health outcomes under prompt, delayed, and no TB treatment scenarios. We compared results to earlier modelling approaches that omit progressive lung damage and post-TB sequelae.","189":" Swine exhibited at agricultural fairs in North America have been the source of repeated zoonotic influenza A virus transmission, which creates a pathway for influenza pandemic emergence. We investigated the effect of using either live-attenuated influenza virus or killed influenza virus vaccines as prefair influenza vaccination of swine on zoonotic influenza transmission risk. Ferrets were exposed to the pigs in order to simulate human exposure in a field setting. We observed reductions in influenza A virus shedding in both groups of vaccinated pigs as well as the corresponding ferret exposure groups, indicating vaccination improved outcomes on both sides of the interface. There was also significant delay in onset of infection among ferrets that were exposed to live-attenuated virus-vaccinated pigs, which might be beneficial during longer fairs. Our findings indicate that policies mandating influenza vaccination of swine before fairs, while not currently common, would reduce the public health risk posed by influenza zoonosis.","190":"Observations of pathogen community structure provide evidence for both the coexistence and replacement of related strains. Despite many studies of specific host-pathogen systems, a unifying framework for predicting the outcomes of interactions among pathogens has remained elusive. We address this gap by developing a pathogen invasion theory (PIT) based on modern ecological coexistence theory and testing the resulting framework against empirical systems. Across major human pathogens, PIT predicts near-universal mutual susceptibility of one strain to invasion by another strain. However, predicting co-circulation from mutual invasion also depends on the degree to which susceptible abundance is reduced below the invasion threshold by overcompensatory epidemic dynamics, and the time it takes for susceptibles to replenish. The transmission advantage of an invading strain and the strength and duration of immunity are key determinants of susceptible dynamics. PIT unifies existing ideas about pathogen co-circulation, offering a quantitative framework for predicting the emergence of novel pathogen strains.","191":"Biphasic decay has been observed for indicators and pathogens in bench-scale and in-situ water experiments for decades, however, first-order decay kinetics continue to be applied to persistence data because of their simplicity and ease of application. Model uncertainty introduced by broadly applying first-order decay kinetics to persistence data may lead to erroneous decision making in the fields of water management and protection. As surface waters are exposed to highly variable environmental and water quality factors that influence microbial and viral persistence, it is expected that first-order decay kinetics are not representative of most of the persistence literature for indicators and pathogens in surface water matrices. This review compiled the methods and results of 61 studies that conducted experiments evaluating the persistence of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), bacteriophages, pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and protozoa in natural surface water matrices. The goals of this review were trifold: (1) collate studies in the literature with data available for future persistence modeling, (2) present the current state of knowledge with regards to the environmental and water quality factors affecting persistence in natural surface waters, and (3) identify recurrent evidence for interactions between the frequently studied factors to inform future factor analyses. Comparing the methods and results across the 61 studies suggest potential interactions between sunlight and water type; sunlight and method of detection; predation and water type; predation and temperature; and water type and method of detection. The majority of the identified literature evaluated FIB or bacteria persistence; future experiments are needed that focus on protozoa, brackish or marine water types, and molecular-based methods of detection.","192":"Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has rapidly progressed from a research tool to a clinical application for the diagnosis and management of tuberculosis and in public health surveillance. This development has been facilitated by drastic drops in cost, advances in technology and concerted efforts to translate sequencing data into actionable information. There is, however, a risk that, in the absence of a consensus and international standards, the widespread use of WGS technology may result in data and processes that lack harmonization, comparability and validation. In this Review, we outline the current landscape of WGS pipelines and applications, and set out best practices for M. tuberculosis WGS, including standards for bioinformatics pipelines, curated repositories of resistance-causing variants, phylogenetic analyses, quality control and standardized reporting.","193":"Overall, the vast majority of antibiotic use could be linked to either an infectious diagnosis or microbiological specimen. Nearly half of antibiotic use occurred when there was a specimen collected but no bacterial organism identified, underscoring the need for rapid and improved diagnostics to optimize antibiotic use.We conducted an observational study using electronic health records from acute care facilities in the United States Veterans Affairs Healthcare System. From October 2017 to September 2018, 482,381 hospitalizations for 332,657 unique patients that met all criteria were included. At least one antibiotic was administered at 202,037 (41.9%) of included hospital stays. We measured frequency of antibiotic use, microbiological specimen collection, and bacterial isolation by diagnosis category and antibiotic group. A tiered system based on specimen collection sites and diagnoses was used to attribute antibiotic use to presumptive causative organisms.Empirical antibiotic use is common in the hospital. Here, we characterize patterns of antibiotic use, infectious diagnoses, and microbiological lab results among hospitalized patients and aim to quantify the proportion of antibiotic use that is potentially attributable to specific bacterial pathogens.Specimens were collected at 130,012 (64.4%) hospitalizations with any antibiotic use, and at least one bacterial organism was isolated at 35.1% of these stays. Frequency of bacterial isolation varied widely by diagnosis category and antibiotic group. Under increasingly lenient criteria, 10.2% to 31.4% of 974,733 antibiotic days-of-therapy could be linked to a potential bacterial pathogen.","194":"Pandemics are enormous threats to the world that impact all aspects of our lives, especially the global economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has emerged since December 2019 and has affected the global economy in many ways. As the world becomes more interconnected, the economic impacts of the pandemic become more serious. In addition to increased health expenditures and reduced labor force, the pandemic has hit the supply and demand chain massively and caused trouble for manufacturers who have to fire some of their employees or delay their economic activities to prevent more loss. With the closure of manufacturers and companies and reduced travel rates, usage of oil after the beginning of the pandemic has decreased significantly that was unprecedented in the last 30\u00a0years. The mining industry is a critical sector in several developing countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic has hit this industry too. Also, world stock markets declined as investors started to become concerned about the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The tourism industry and airlines have also experienced an enormous loss too. The GDP has reduced, and this pandemic will cost the world more than 2 trillion at the end of 2020.","195":"Routinely collected mobile phone data provide a simple and low-cost approach to mapping the uptake of preventive healthcare in low-income settings.Poor physical access to health facilities has been identified as an important contributor to reduced uptake of preventive health services and is likely to be most critical in low-income settings. However, the relation among physical access, travel behavior, and the uptake of healthcare is difficult to quantify.We document that long travel times to health facilities are strongly correlated with increased mobility in geographically isolated areas. Furthermore, we found that in areas with equal physical access to healthcare, mobile phone-derived measures of mobility predict which regions are lacking preventive care.Using anonymized mobile phone data from 2008 to 2009, we analyze individual and spatially aggregated travel patterns of 14,816,521 subscribers across Kenya and compare these measures to (1) estimated travel times to health facilities and (2) data on the uptake of 2 preventive healthcare interventions in an area of western Kenya: childhood immunizations and antenatal care.","196":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron strain has evolved into highly divergent variants with several sub-lineages. These newly emerging variants threaten the efficacy of available COVID-19 vaccines. To mitigate the occurrence of breakthrough infections and re-infections, and more importantly, to reduce the disease burden, it is essential to develop a strategy for producing updated multivalent vaccines that can provide broad neutralization against both currently circulating and emerging variants. We developed bivalent vaccine AdCLD-CoV19-1 BA.5\/BA.2.75 and trivalent vaccines AdCLD-CoV19-1 XBB\/BN.1\/BQ.1.1 and AdCLD-CoV19-1 XBB.1.5\/BN.1\/BQ.1.1 using an Ad5\/35 platform-based non-replicating recombinant adenoviral vector. We compared immune responses elicited by the monovalent and multivalent vaccines in mice and macaques. We found that the BA.5\/BA.2.75 bivalent and the XBB\/BN.1\/BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5\/BN.1\/BQ.1.1 trivalent vaccines exhibited improved cross-neutralization ability compared to their respective monovalent vaccines. These data suggest that the developed multivalent vaccines enhance immunity against circulating Omicron subvariants and effectively elicit neutralizing antibodies across a broad spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 variants.","197":"Mathematical models describing indirect contact transmission are an important component of infectious disease mitigation and risk assessment. A model that tracks microorganisms between compartments by coupled ordinary differential equations or a Markov chain is benchmarked against a mechanistic interpretation of the physical transfer of microorganisms from surfaces to fingers and subsequently to a susceptible person's facial mucosal membranes. The primary objective was to compare these models in their estimates of doses and changes in microorganism concentrations on hands and fomites over time. The abilities of the models to capture the impact of episodic events, such as hand hygiene, and of contact patterns were also explored. For both models, greater doses were estimated for the asymmetrical scenarios in which a more contaminated fomite was touched more often. Differing representations of hand hygiene in the Markov model did not notably impact estimated doses but affected pathogen concentration dynamics on hands. When using the Markov model, losses due to hand hygiene should be handled as separate events as opposed to time-averaging expected losses. The discrete event model demonstrated the effect of hand-to-mouth contact timing on the dose. Understanding how model design influences estimated doses is important for advancing models as reliable risk assessment tools.","198":"Increased vaccine hesitancy and refusal negatively affects vaccine uptake, leading to the reemergence of vaccine preventable diseases. We aim to quantify the relative importance of factors people consider when making vaccine decisions for themselves, or for their child, with specific attention for underlying motives arising from context, such as required effort (accessibility) and opportunism (free riding on herd immunity). We documented attitudes towards vaccination and performed a discrete choice experiment in 4802 respondents in The United Kingdom, France and Belgium, eliciting preferences for six attributes: (1) vaccine effectiveness, (2) vaccine preventable disease burden, (3) vaccine accessibility in terms of copayment, vaccinator and administrative requirements, (4) frequency of mild vaccine-related side-effects, (5) vaccination coverage in the country's population and (6) local vaccination coverage in personal networks. We distinguished adults deciding on vaccination for themselves from parents deciding for their youngest child. While all attributes were found to be significant, vaccine effectiveness and accessibility stood out in all (sub)samples, followed by vaccine preventable disease burden. We confirmed that people attach more value to severity of disease compared to its frequency, and discovered that peer influence dominates free-rider motives, especially for the vaccination of children. These behavioral data are insightful for policy and are essential to parameterize dynamic vaccination behavior in simulation models. In contrast to what most game theoretical models assume, social norms dominate free-rider incentives. Policy-makers and healthcare workers should actively communicate on high vaccination coverage, and draw attention to the effectiveness of vaccines while optimizing their practical accessibility.","199":"Molecular epidemiology using genomic data can help identify relationships between malaria parasite population structure, malaria transmission intensity, and ultimately help generate actionable data to assess the effectiveness of malaria control strategies. Genomic data, coupled with geographic information systems data, can further identify clusters or hotspots of malaria transmission, parasite genetic and spatial connectivity, and parasite movement by human or mosquito mobility over time and space. In this study, we performed longitudinal genomic surveillance in a cohort of 70 participants over four years from different neighborhoods and households in Thi\u00e8s, Senegal-a region of exceptionally low malaria transmission (entomological inoculation rate less than 1). Genetic identity (identity by state, IBS) was established using a 24-single nucleotide polymorphism molecular barcode, identity by descent was calculated from whole genome sequence data, and a hierarchical Bayesian regression model was used to establish genetic and spatial relationships. Our results show clustering of genetically similar parasites within households and a decline in genetic similarity of parasites with increasing distance. One household showed extremely high diversity and warrants further investigation as to the source of these diverse genetic types. This study illustrates the utility of genomic data with traditional epidemiological approaches for surveillance and detection of trends and patterns in malaria transmission not only by neighborhood but also by household. This approach can be implemented regionally and countrywide to strengthen and support malaria control and elimination efforts.","200":"Gains in immunization coverage and delivery of primary health care service have stagnated in recent years. Remaining gaps in service coverage reflect multiple underlying reasons that may be amenable to improved health system design. Immunization systems and other primary health care services can be mutually supportive, for improved service delivery and for strengthening of Universal Health Coverage. Improvements require that dynamic and multi-faceted barriers and risks be addressed. These include workforce availability, quality data systems and use, leadership and management that is innovative, flexible, data driven and responsive to local needs. Concurrently, improvements in procurement, supply chain, logistics and delivery systems, and integrated monitoring of vaccine coverage and epidemiological disease surveillance with laboratory systems, and vaccine safety will be needed to support community engagement and drive prioritized actions and communication. Finally, political will and sustained resource commitment with transparent accountability mechanisms are required. The experience of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on essential PHC services and the challenges of vaccine roll-out affords an opportunity to apply lessons learned in order to enhance vaccine services integrated with strong primary health care services and universal health coverage across the life course.","201":"The use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) in children has a strong indirect effect on disease rates in adults. When children are vaccinated with PCVs, other serotypes that are not targeted by the vaccine can increase in frequency (serotype replacement) and reduce the direct and indirect benefits of the vaccine. To understand and predict the likely impacts of serotype replacement, it is important to know how patterns in the transmission of serotypes among children relate to disease rates in adults. We used data on pneumococcal carriage and disease from Navajo Nation children and adults collected before and after the routine use of PCVs (1998-2012). Using regression models within a Bayesian framework, we found that serotype-specific carriage and invasiveness (disease incidence divided by carriage prevalence) had similar patterns in children and adults. Moreover, carriage in children, invasiveness in children, and a serotype-specific random intercept (which captured additional variation associated with the serotypes) could predict the incidence serotype-specific pneumococcal disease in adults 18-39 years of age and those 40 years of age or older in the era of routine use of PCVs. These models could help us predict the effects of future pneumococcal vaccine use in children on disease rates in adults, and the modeling approach developed here could be used to test these findings in other settings.","202":"Following its emergence in Wuhan, China, in late November or early December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has rapidly spread globally. Genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 allows reconstruction of its transmission history, although this is contingent on sampling. We have analyzed 453 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected between 20 February and 15 March 2020 from infected patients in Washington State, USA. We find that most SARS-CoV-2 infections sampled during this time derive from a single introduction in late January or early February 2020 which subsequently spread locally before active community surveillance was implemented.","203":"Biomedical studies often generate repeated measures of multiple outcomes on a set of subjects. It may be of interest to develop a biologically intuitive model for the joint evolution of these outcomes while assessing inter-subject heterogeneity. Even though it is common for biological processes to entail non-linear relationships, examples of multivariate non-linear mixed models (MNMMs) are still fairly rare. We contribute to this area by jointly analyzing the maternal antibody decay for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, allowing for a different non-linear decay model for each infectious disease. We present a general modeling framework to analyze multivariate non-linear longitudinal profiles subject to censoring, by combining multivariate random effects, non-linear growth and Tobit regression. We explore the hypothesis of a common infant-specific mechanism underlying maternal immunity using a pairwise correlated random-effects approach and evaluating different correlation matrix structures. The implied marginal correlation between maternal antibody levels is estimated using simulations. The mean duration of passive immunity was less than 4 months for all diseases with substantial heterogeneity between infants. The maternal antibody levels against rubella and varicella were found to be positively correlated, while little to no correlation could be inferred for the other disease pairs. For some pairs, computational issues occurred with increasing correlation matrix complexity, which underlines the importance of further developing estimation methods for MNMMs.","204":"In 2010 the identities of thousands of anti-Plasmodium compounds were released publicly to facilitate malaria drug development. Understanding these compounds' mechanisms of action--i.e., the specific molecular targets by which they kill the parasite--would further facilitate the drug development process. Given that kinases are promising anti-malaria targets, we screened ~14,000 cell-active compounds for activity against five different protein kinases. Collections of cell-active compounds from GlaxoSmithKline (the ~13,000-compound Tres Cantos Antimalarial Set, or TCAMS), St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (260 compounds), and the Medicines for Malaria Venture (the 400-compound Malaria Box) were screened in biochemical assays of Plasmodium falciparum calcium-dependent protein kinases 1 and 4 (CDPK1 and CDPK4), mitogen-associated protein kinase 2 (MAPK2\/MAP2), protein kinase 6 (PK6), and protein kinase 7 (PK7). Novel potent inhibitors (IC50 < 1 \u03bcM) were discovered for three of the kinases: CDPK1, CDPK4, and PK6. The PK6 inhibitors are the most potent yet discovered for this enzyme and deserve further scrutiny. Additionally, kinome-wide competition assays revealed a compound that inhibits CDPK4 with few effects on ~150 human kinases, and several related compounds that inhibit CDPK1 and CDPK4 yet have limited cytotoxicity to human (HepG2) cells. Our data suggest that inhibiting multiple Plasmodium kinase targets without harming human cells is challenging but feasible.","205":" Gut microbiota diversity has become the subject of extensive research in human and nonhuman animals, linking diversity and composition to gut function and host health. Because wild primates are good indicators of tropical ecosystem health, we developed the idea that they are a suitable model to observe the consequences of advancing global change (e.g., habitat degradation) on gut microbiota. So far, most of the studies focus mainly on gut bacteria; however, they are not the only component of the gut: fungi also serve essential functions in gut homeostasis. Here, for the first time, we explore and measure diversity and composition of both bacterial and fungal microbiota components of two tropical primate species living in highly different habitat types (intact versus degraded forests). Results on their microbiota diversity and composition are discussed in light of conservation issues and potential applications.","206":"Abstract In this retrospective study, chest CTs of 121 symptomatic patients infected with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) from four centers in China from January 18, 2020 to February 2, 2020 were...","207":"Current guidelines recommend community-wide mass azithromycin for trachoma, but a targeted treatment strategy could reduce the volume of antibiotics required.At baseline the mean prevalence of ocular chlamydia in the three arms ranged from 7-9% among 0-5 year-olds and from 3-9% among 8-12 year-olds. Averaged across months 12-24, the mean prevalence of ocular chlamydia among 0-5 year-olds was 16.7% (95%CI 9.0%-24.4%) in the targeted arm and 22.3% (95%CI 11.1%-33.6%) in the delayed arm (P=0.61). The final mean prevalence of ocular chlamydia among 8-12 year-olds was 13.5% (95% CI 7.9%-19.1%) in the targeted arm and 5.5% (95% CI 0.3%-10.7%) in the mass treatment arm (adjusted risk difference 8.5 percentage points [pp] higher in the targeted arm, 95% CI 0.9 pp -16.1 pp higher).Antibiotic treatments targeted to infected pre-school children did not result in significantly less ocular chlamydia infections compared with untreated communities, and did not meet non-inferiority criteria relative to mass azithromycin distributions. Targeted approaches may require treatment of a broader segment of the population in areas with hyperendemic trachoma.48 Ethiopian communities were randomized to mass, targeted, or delayed azithromycin distributions. In the targeted arm, only children aged 6 months to 5 years with evidence of ocular chlamydia received azithromycin, distributed thrice over the following year. The primary outcome was ocular chlamydia at months 12 and 24, comparing the targeted and delayed arms (0-5 year-olds, superiority analysis) and the targeted and mass azithromycin arms (8-12 year-olds, non-inferiority analysis, 10% non-inferiority margin).","208":"An approach to meta-analysis of multichotomous tests or CPRs is presented. A spreadsheet for data preparation and code for R and Stata are provided for other researchers to download and use. Combined with summary estimates of the AUROCC and calibration, this is a comprehensive strategy for meta-analysis of multichotomous tests and CPRs.Multichotomous tests have three or more outcome or risk categories, and can provide richer information and a better fit with clinical decision-making than dichotomous tests. Our objective is to present a fully developed approach to the meta-analysis of multichotomous clinical prediction rules (CPRs) and tests, including meta-analysis of stratum specific likelihood ratios.Using data from 10 studies of the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) risk score for prostate cancer recurrence, we calculated summary estimates of the likelihood ratios for low, moderate and high risk groups of 0.40 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.49), 1.24 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.55) and 4.47 (95% CI 3.21 to 6.23), respectively. Applying the summary estimates of the likelihood ratios for each risk group to the overall prevalence of cancer recurrence in a population allows one to estimate the likelihood of recurrence for each risk group in that population.We have developed a novel approach to the meta-analysis of likelihood ratios for multichotomous tests that avoids the need to dichotomise outcome categories, and demonstrate its application to a sample CPR. We also review previously reported approaches to the meta-analysis of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCC) and meta-analysis of a measure of calibration (observed:expected) for multichotomous tests or CPRs.","209":"The relationship between malaria infection and malnutrition is complex. Using data from a randomized controlled trial of 450 children 0-5 years of age in Burkina Faso, we examined the effect of malaria infection on short-term changes in anthropometric measures, the effect of malnutrition on malaria infection, and whether age modified the effect of baseline anthropometric measures on malaria infection. Malaria infection, assessed by blood smear microscopy and weight, height, mid-upper arm circumference, height-for-age z-score, weight-for-age z-score, and weight-for-height z-score were measured at three time points: baseline, 2 weeks, and 6 months. We used generalized estimating equations adjusted for sex, age, breastfeeding, maternal education, and study treatment (azithromycin versus placebo) for all analyses. Interaction terms were used to assess effect modification by age. Among the 366 children with no malaria infection at baseline, 43 (11.6%) had malaria infection within 6 months. There were no important differences in anthropometric measures at 2 weeks and 6 months between those with and without malaria infection at baseline. There were no significant differences in prevalence of malaria infection by baseline anthropometric measures. Age (0-30 months versus 30-60 months) modified the effect of baseline weight and height on malaria infection. Among those aged 0-30 months, for each kilogram increase in weight, malaria infection increased by 27% (95% CI: 6-53%), and for each centimeter increase in height, it increased by 9% (95% CI: 1-17%), but there were no differences for those aged 30-60 months.","210":"Nearly three decades into the epidemic, sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains the region most heavily affected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with nearly 70% of the 34 million people living with HIV globally residing in the region. In SSA, female and male youth (15 to 24 years) are at a disproportionately high risk of HIV infection compared to adults. As such, there is a need to target HIV prevention strategies to youth and to tailor them to a gender-specific context. This protocol describes the process for the multi-staged approach in the design of the MP3 Youth pilot study, a gender-specific, combination, HIV prevention intervention for youth in Kenya.The mixed-methods, cross-sectional, longitudinal cohort pilot study protocol was developed by first conducting a systematic review of the literature, which shaped focus group discussions around prevention package and delivery options, and that also informed age- and sex- stratified mathematical modeling. The review, qualitative data, and mathematical modeling created a triangulated evidence base of interventions to be included in the pilot study protocol. To design the pilot study protocol, we convened an expert panel to select HIV prevention interventions effective for youth in SSA, which will be offered in a mobile health setting. The goal of the pilot study implementation and evaluation is to apply lessons learned to more effective HIV prevention evidence and programming.The combination HIV prevention package in this protocol includes (1) offering HIV testing and counseling for all youth; (2) voluntary medical circumcision and condoms for males; (3) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), conditional cash transfer (CCT), and contraceptives for females; and (4) referrals for HIV care among those identified as HIV-positive. The combination package platform selected is mobile health teams in an integrated services delivery model. A cross-sectional analysis will be conducted to determine the uptake of the interventions. To determine long-term impact, the protocol outlines enrolling selected participants in mutually exclusive longitudinal cohorts (HIV-positive, PrEP, CCT, and HIV-negative) followed by using mobile phone text messages (short message service, SMS) and in-person surveys to prospectively assess prevention method uptake, adherence, and risk compensation behaviors. Cross-sectional and sub-cohort analyses will be conducted to determine intervention packages uptake.The literature review, focus groups, and modeling indicate that offering age- and gender- specific combination HIV prevention interventions that include biomedical, behavioral, and structural interventions can have an impact on HIV risk reduction. Implementing this protocol will show the feasibility of delivering these services at scale. The MP3 Youth study is one of the few combination HIV prevention intervention protocols incorporating youth- and gender-specific interventions in one delivery setting. Lessons learned from the design of the protocol can be incorporated into the national guidance for combination HIV prevention for youth in Kenya and other high-burden SSA settings.The objective of this multi-method protocol is to outline a rigorous and replicable methodology for a gender-specific combination HIV prevention pilot study for youth in high-burden settings, illustrating the triangulated methods undertaken to ensure that age, sex, and context are integral in the design of the intervention.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01571128; http:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT01571128?term=MP3+youth&rank=1 (Archived by WebCite at http:\/\/www.webcitation.org\/6nmioPd54).","211":"This SHEA white paper identifies knowledge gaps and challenges in healthcare epidemiology research related to COVID-19 with a focus on core principles of healthcare epidemiology. These gaps, revealed during the worst phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, are described in 10 sections: epidemiology, outbreak investigation, surveillance, isolation precaution practices, personal protective equipment (PPE), environmental contamination and disinfection, drug and supply shortages, antimicrobial stewardship, healthcare personnel (HCP) occupational safety, and return to work policies. Each section highlights three critical healthcare epidemiology research questions with detailed description provided in supplemental materials. This research agenda calls for translational studies from laboratory-based basic science research to well-designed, large-scale studies and health outcomes research. Research gaps and challenges related to nursing homes and social disparities are included. Collaborations across various disciplines, expertise and across diverse geographic locations will be critical.","212":"Increases in vaccine hesitancy and vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks have focused attention on state laws governing school-entry vaccine mandates and the allowable exemptions (medical and nonmedical) from those mandates. There is substantial variation in the type of exemptions available in each state, and states with more rigorous or burdensome exemption requirements generally have lower exemption rates. States have little evidence, however, about how vaccine-hesitant parents respond to different requirements. Despite recent efforts to formulate \"model legislation\" templates for states to follow, policy evidence about optimal exemption regimes is limited to observational studies in states that have changed exemption laws. We conducted two online experiments to explore how parental attitudes and intentions responded to different school-entry vaccine mandate exemption requirements. We randomly assigned online participants to one of four hypothetical vaccine exemption application scenarios: parental signature only, a checklist of vaccines for which an exemption is requested, a lengthy (10-30+ min) video-based vaccine education module, and a requirement to write a statement justifying the exemption. Among parents with high vaccine hesitancy, a required vaccine education module led to significant decreases in vaccine hesitancy, while checklist and justification requirements increased vaccine hesitancy slightly. Among parents with low vaccine hesitancy, we observed a potential backfire effect when parents were required to write a justification statement. Our findings warrant replication in a larger, fully-powered trial to accelerate knowledge about how parents across the vaccine hesitancy spectrum respond to exemption regimes.","213":"The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked unprecedented public health and social measures (PHSM) by national and local governments, including border restrictions, school closures, mandatory facemask use and stay at home orders. Quantifying the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing disease transmission is key to rational policy making in response to the current and future pandemics. In order to estimate the effectiveness of these interventions, detailed descriptions of their timelines, scale and scope are needed. The Health Intervention Tracking for COVID-19 (HIT-COVID) is a curated and standardized global database that catalogues the implementation and relaxation of COVID-19 related PHSM. With a team of over 200 volunteer contributors, we assembled policy timelines for a range of key PHSM aimed at reducing COVID-19 risk for the national and first administrative levels (e.g. provinces and states) globally, including details such as the degree of implementation and targeted populations. We continue to maintain and adapt this database to the changing COVID-19 landscape so it can serve as a resource for researchers and policymakers alike.","214":"The foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes generally infects immunocompromised individuals, such as cancer patients, more frequently and with higher morbidity and mortality than the general population. Because of the anticipated risk associated with L. monocytogenes and other pathogens in produce, immunocompromised individuals are often placed on neutropenic diets that exclude fresh produce, though these risks have not been quantified. Therefore, this study developed a data-driven risk model for listeriosis in cancer patients who consume ready-to-eat (RTE) salads, consisting of leafy greens, cucumbers, and tomatoes, as influenced by kitchen-scale treatments and storage practices. Monte Carlo simulations were used to model the risk of invasive listeriosis during one chemotherapy cycle. Refrigerating all salad components decreased the median risk by approximately one-half log. For refrigerated salads with no treatment, the predicted median risk was \u2264 4.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-08. When salad ingredients were surface blanched with greens rinsed, the predicted risk decreased to 5.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-10. Predicted risk was lowest (1.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-13) for a blanched \"salad\" consisting of solely cucumbers and tomatoes. Interestingly, rinsing, as recommended by FDA, only decreased the median risk by 1 log. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the highly variable dose-response parameter k strongly influenced risk, indicating that reducing uncertainty in this variable may improve model accuracy. Overall, this study demonstrates that kitchen-scale pathogen reduction approaches have high risk reduction efficacy and could be considered as an alternative to diets that exclude produce when making risk management decisions.","215":"This was a cross-sectional study set in a large public university between January 22 and March 22, 2021. We surveyed students about demographics, risk factors, and symptoms, and simultaneously tested their saliva for IgA antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. To estimate the prevalence of previous infection we adjusted our intentional sample of a diverse student population for year in school and age to resemble the composition of the entire student body and adjusted for the imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the antibody test. Univariate and multiple regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for infection, and the proportion of students with persistent symptoms following acute infection was determined.A total of 488 students completed the survey, 432 had a valid antibody result, and 428 had both. The estimated prevalence of previous infection for 432 participants with valid antibody results was 41%. Of 145 students in our sample with a positive antibody test, 41.4% denied having a previous positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 and presumably had an asymptomatic infection; in our adjusted analysis we estimate that approximately 2-thirds of students had asymptomatic infections. Independent risk factors for infection included male sex, having a roommate with a known symptomatic infection, and having two or fewer roommates. More frequent attendance of parties and bars was a univariate risk factor, but not in the multiple regression analysis. Of 122 students reporting a previous symptomatic infection, 14 (11.4%) reported persistent symptoms consistent with postacute COVID-19 a median of 132 days later.Universities are unique settings with large populations, congregate housing, and frequent attendance of events in large groups. However, the current prevalence of previous COVID-19 infection in university students, including symptomatic and asymptomatic disease, is unknown. Our goal therefore was to determine the prevalence of previous infection, risk factors for infection, and the prevalence of persistent symptoms following infection among university students.Previous COVID-19 infection, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, was common at a large university. Measures that could prevent resurgence of the infection when students return to campus include mandatory vaccination policies, mass surveillance testing, and testing of sewage for antigen to SARS-CoV-2.","216":"Disparities in serologic testing and seropositivity exist on SES and race\/ethnicity across NYC, indicative of excess coronavirus disease burden in vulnerable and marginalized populations.Serologic data were downloaded from the NYC Coronavirus data repository (August 2020-December 2020). Area-level characteristics for NYC neighborhoods were downloaded from United States census data and a socioeconomic vulnerability index was created. Spatial generalized linear mixed models were performed to examine the association between SES and antibody testing and positivity.The proportion of Hispanic population (posterior median, 0.001 [95% credible interval, 0.0003-0.002]), healthcare workers (0.003 [0.0001-0.006]), essential workers (0.003 [0.001-0.005]), age \u226565 years (0.003 [0.00002-0.006]), and high SES (SES quartile 3 vs 1: 0.034 [0.003-0.062]) were positively associated with antibody tests per 100000 residents. The White proportion (-0.002 [-0.003 to -0.001]), SES index (quartile 3 vs 1, -0.068 [-0.115 to -0.017]; quartile 4 vs 1, -0.077 [-0.134 to -0.018]) and age \u226565 years (-0.005 [-0.009 to -0.002]) were inversely associated with positive test prevalence (%), whereas the Hispanic (0.004 [0.002-0.006]) and essential worker (0.008 [0.003-0.012]) proportions had positive coefficients.We characterized severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody test prevalence and positive test prevalence across New York City (NYC) in order to investigate disparities in testing outcomes by race and socioeconomic status (SES).","217":"Deciphering the properties of vaccines against an emerging pathogen is essential for optimizing immunization strategies. Early after vaccine roll-out, however, uncertainties about vaccine immunity raise the question of how much time is needed to estimate these properties, particularly the durability of vaccine protection. Here we designed a simulation study, based on a generic transmission model of vaccination, to simulate the impact of a breadth of vaccines with different mean (range: 10 months-2 years) and variability (coefficient of variation range: 50-100%) of the duration of protection. Focusing on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2\u2006in the year after start of mass immunization in Germany as a case study, we then assessed how confidently the duration of protection could be estimated under a range of epidemiological scenarios. We found that lower mean and higher heterogeneity facilitated estimation of the duration of vaccine protection. Across the vaccines tested, rapid waning and high heterogeneity permitted complete identification of the duration of protection; by contrast, slow waning and low heterogeneity allowed only estimation of the fraction of vaccinees with rapid loss of immunity. These findings suggest that limited epidemiological data can inform the duration of vaccine immunity. More generally, they highlight the need to carefully consider immunological heterogeneity when designing transmission models to evaluate vaccines.","218":"Dengue is one of the most widespread vector-borne viral diseases in the world. However, the size, heterogeneity, and temporal dynamics of the cell-associated viral reservoir during acute dengue virus (DENV) infection remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed cells infected in vitro with DENV and PBMC from an individual experiencing a natural DENV infection utilizing 5' capture single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). Both positive- and negative-sense DENV RNA was detected in reactions containing either an oligo(dT) primer alone, or in reactions supplemented with a DENV-specific primer. The addition of a DENV-specific primer did not increase the total amount of DENV RNA captured or the fraction of cells identified as containing DENV RNA. However, inclusion of a DENV-specific cDNA primer did increase the viral genome coverage immediately 5' to the primer binding site. Furthermore, while the majority of intracellular DENV sequence captured in this analysis mapped to the 5' end of the viral genome, distinct patterns of enhanced coverage within the DENV polyprotein coding region were observed. The 5' capture scRNAseq analysis of PBMC not only recapitulated previously published reports by detecting virally infected memory and na\u00efve B cells, but also identified cell-associated genomic variants not observed in contemporaneous serum samples. These results demonstrate that oligo(dT) primed 5' capture scRNAseq can detect DENV RNA and quantify virus-infected cells in physiologically relevant conditions, and provides insight into viral sequence variability within infected cells.","219":"An estimated 73% of emerging infections are zoonotic in origin, with animal contact and encroachment on their habitats increasing the risk of spill-over events. In Vietnam, close exposure to a wide range of animals and animal products can lead to acquisition of zoonotic pathogens, a number of which cause central nervous system (CNS) infections. However, studies show the aetiology of CNS infections remains unknown in around half of cases. We used samples and data from hospitalised patients with CNS infections, enrolled into the Vietnam Initiative on Zoonotic Infections multicentre study, to determine the association between aetiology and animal contact including those in whom the cause was unknown. Among 933 patients, a pathogen or an antibody response to it was identified in 291 (31.2%, 95% CI 28.3-34.3%). The most common pathogens were Streptococcus suis (n\u2009=\u200991 (9.8%, 8.0-11.9%)) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) (n\u2009=\u200972 (7.7%, 6.1-9.7%)). Commonly reported animal contact included keeping, raising or handling (n\u2009=\u2009364 (39.0%, 35.9-42.2%)) and handling, cooking or consuming raw meat, blood or viscera in the 2\u00a0weeks prior to symptom onset (n\u2009=\u2009371 (39.8%, 36.6-43.0%)), with the latter most commonly from pigs (n\u2009=\u2009343 (36.9%, 33.8-40.1%). There was no association between an unknown aetiology and exposure to animals in a multivariate logistic regression. Further testing for unknown or undetected pathogens may increase diagnostic yield, however, given the high proportion of zoonotic pathogens and the presence of risk factors, increasing public awareness about zoonoses and preventive measures can be considered.","220":"Although open-access data are increasingly common and useful to epidemiological research, the curation of such datasets is resource-intensive and time-consuming. Despite the existence of a major source of COVID-19 data, the regularly disclosed case reports were often written in natural language with an unstructured format. Here, we propose a computational framework that can automatically extract epidemiological information from open-access COVID-19 case reports. We develop this framework by coupling a language model developed using deep neural networks with training samples compiled using an optimized data annotation strategy. When applied to the COVID-19 case reports collected from mainland China, our framework outperforms all other state-of-the-art deep learning models. The information extracted from our approach is highly consistent with that obtained from the gold-standard manual coding, with a matching rate of 80%. To disseminate our algorithm, we provide an open-access online platform that is able to estimate key epidemiological statistics in real time, with much less effort for data curation.","221":"SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible in households than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the elderly \u226560 years old are the most vulnerable to household transmission. Case finding and isolation alone may be inadequate to contain the pandemic and need to be used in conjunction with heightened restriction of human movement as implemented in Guangzhou.Based on a comprehensive contact-tracing dataset from Guangzhou, we estimated both the population-level effective reproductive number and individual-level secondary attack rate (SAR) in the household setting. We assessed age effects on transmissibility and the infectivity of COVID-19 cases during their incubation period.As of April 2, 2020, the global reported number of COVID-19 cases has crossed over 1 million with more than 55,000 deaths. The household transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen, remains elusive.A total of 195 unrelated clusters with 212 primary cases, 137 nonprimary (secondary or tertiary) cases and 1938 uninfected close contacts were traced. We estimated the household SAR to be 13.8% (95% CI: 11.1-17.0%) if household contacts are defined as all close relatives and 19.3% (95% CI: 15.5-23.9%) if household contacts only include those at the same residential address as the cases, assuming a mean incubation period of 4 days and a maximum infectious period of 13 days. The odds of infection among children (<20 years old) was only 0.26 (95% CI: 0.13-0.54) times of that among the elderly (\u226560 years old). There was no gender difference in the risk of infection. COVID-19 cases were at least as infectious during their incubation period as during their illness. On average, a COVID-19 case infected 0.48 (95% CI: 0.39-0.58) close contacts. Had isolation not been implemented, this number increases to 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51-0.75). The effective reproductive number in Guangzhou dropped from above 1 to below 0.5 in about 1 week.","222":"Using national COVID-19 notification, hospitalisation, and vaccination datasets from Brazil, we did a test-negative, case-control study to assess the effectiveness of four vaccines (CoronaVac [Sinovac], ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 [AstraZeneca], Ad26.COV2.S [Janssen], and BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNtech]) for individuals with laboratory-confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. We matched cases with RT-PCR positive, symptomatic COVID-19 with up to ten controls with negative RT-PCR tests who presented with symptomatic illnesses, restricting both groups to tests done at least 90 days after an initial infection. We used multivariable conditional logistic regression to compare the odds of test positivity and the odds of hospitalisation or death due to COVID-19, according to vaccination status and time since first or second dose of vaccines.COVID-19 vaccines have proven highly effective among individuals without a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, but their effectiveness in preventing symptomatic infection and severe outcomes among individuals with previous infection is less clear. We aimed to estimate the effectiveness of four COVID-19 vaccines against symptomatic infection, hospitalisation, and death for individuals with laboratory-confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.All four vaccines conferred additional protection against symptomatic infections and severe outcomes among individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The provision of a full vaccine series to individuals after recovery from COVID-19 might reduce morbidity and mortality.Brazilian National Research Council, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, JBS, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, and Generalitat de Catalunya.Between Feb 24, 2020, and Nov 11, 2021, we identified 213\u2009457 individuals who had a subsequent, symptomatic illness with RT-PCR testing done at least 90 days after their initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and after the vaccination programme started. Among these, 30\u2009910 (14\u00b75%) had a positive RT-PCR test consistent with reinfection, and we matched 22\u2009566 of these cases with 145\u2009055 negative RT-PCR tests from 68\u2009426 individuals as controls. Among individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection 14 or more days from vaccine series completion was 39\u00b74% (95% CI 36\u00b71-42\u00b76) for CoronaVac, 56\u00b70% (51\u00b74-60\u00b72) for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 44\u00b70% (31\u00b75-54\u00b72) for Ad26.COV2.S, and 64\u00b78% (54\u00b79-72\u00b74) for BNT162b2. For the two-dose vaccine series (CoronaVac, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and BNT162b2), effectiveness against symptomatic infection was significantly greater after the second dose than after the first dose. Effectiveness against hospitalisation or death 14 or more days from vaccine series completion was 81\u00b73% (75\u00b73-85\u00b78) for CoronaVac, 89\u00b79% (83\u00b75-93\u00b78) for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 57\u00b77% (-2\u00b76 to 82\u00b75) for Ad26.COV2.S, and 89\u00b77% (54\u00b73-97\u00b77) for BNT162b2.","223":"To examine the effects of poor sanitation and hygiene on the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, we surveyed households in two rural and two urban communities in Guatemala (N\u2009=\u2009196 randomly selected households). One adult (\u2265\u200918-years old) and, when available, one child (\u2264\u20095\u00a0years-old) provided a stool sample. Up to 48 presumptive Escherichia coli isolates were collected from each stool sample (n\u2009=\u200921,256 total) and were subjected to breakpoint assays for ten antibiotics. Mixed-effects logistic models were used to identify potential factors influencing the likelihood of harboring antibiotic-resistant bacteria. For nine out of ten antibiotics, the odds of detecting resistant bacteria decreased by\u2009~\u200932% (odds ratios, OR 0.53-0.8, P\u2009\u20091.89-9.6). Poor hygiene conditions likely obscure effects of individual antibiotic use, presumably due to enhanced microbial transmission. Consequently, efforts to improve antibiotic stewardship should be coupled with improving hygiene conditions.","224":"Mycobacterium canettii (MCAN) is a causative agent of tuberculosis in humans, along with the members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). Frequently used as an outgroup to the MTBC in phylogenetic analyses, MCAN is thought to offer the best proxy for the progenitor species that gave rise to the complex. Here, we leverage whole genome sequencing data and biologically relevant population genomic models to compare the evolutionary dynamics driving variation in the recombining MCAN with that in the non-recombining MTBC, and discuss differences in observed genomic diversity in the light of expected levels of Hill-Robertson interference. In doing so, we highlight the methodological challenges of estimating recombination rates through traditional population genetic approaches using sequences called from populations of microorganisms, and evaluate the likely mis-inference that arises owing to a neglect of common model violations including purifying selection, background selection, progeny skew, and population size change. In addition, we compare performance when full within-host polymorphism data is utilized, versus the more common approach of basing analyses on within-host consensus sequences.","225":"Large calvarial defects represent a major reconstructive challenge, as they do not heal spontaneously. Infection causes inflammation and scarring, further reducing the healing capacity of the calvaria. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) has been shown to stimulate osteogenesis but has significant side effects in high doses. BMP2 has not been tested in combination with antiinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-10.Sixteen New Zealand White rabbits underwent 15 \u00d7 15-mm flap calvarectomies. The flap was incubated in Staphylococcus aureus and replaced, and infection and scarring were allowed to develop. The flap was subsequently removed and the wound d\u00e9brided. A 15 \u00d7 15-mm square of acellular dermal matrix biopatterned with low-dose BMP2, interleukin-10, or a combination was implanted. Computed tomographic scans were taken over 42 days. Rabbits were then killed and histology was performed.Defects treated with BMP2 showed significantly (p < 0.05) greater osseous regeneration than untreated controls. Interleukin-10 did not significantly augment the healing achieved with BMP2, and interleukin-10 alone did not significantly increase healing compared with controls. Histology showed evidence of bone formation in defects treated with BMP2. Untreated controls and defects treated with interleukin-10 alone showed only fibrous tissue in the defect site.Low-dose BMP2 delivered directly to the scarred calvarial defect augments bony healing. Interleukin-10 at the dose applied did not significantly augment healing alone or in combination with BMP2. Healing had not finished at 42 days and analysis at later time points or the use of higher doses of BMP2 may yield greater healing.","226":"Responding to an outbreak of a novel coronavirus [agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] in December 2019, China banned travel to and from Wuhan city on 23 January 2020 and implemented a national emergency response. We investigated the spread and control of COVID-19 using a data set that included case reports, human movement, and public health interventions. The Wuhan shutdown was associated with the delayed arrival of COVID-19 in other cities by 2.91 days. Cities that implemented control measures preemptively reported fewer cases on average (13.0) in the first week of their outbreaks compared with cities that started control later (20.6). Suspending intracity public transport, closing entertainment venues, and banning public gatherings were associated with reductions in case incidence. The national emergency response appears to have delayed the growth and limited the size of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, averting hundreds of thousands of cases by 19 February (day 50).","227":" parasites in the skin and the role of the dermal immune response.","228":"We aimed to identify how patient (age, sex, condition) and paramedic factors (sex, role) affected prehospital analgesic administration and pain alleviation.We used a cross-sectional design with a 7-day retrospective sample of adults aged 18\u202fyears or over requiring primary emergency transport to hospital, excluding patients with Glasgow Coma Scale below 13, in two UK ambulance services. Multivariate multilevel regression using Stata 14 analysed factors independently associated with analgesic administration and a clinically meaningful reduction in pain (\u22652 points on 0-10 numerical verbal pain score [NVPS]).We included data on 9574 patients. At least two pain scores were recorded in 4773 (49.9%) patients. For all models fitted there was no significant relationship between analgesic administration or pain reduction and sex of the patient or ambulance staff. Reduction in pain (NVPS \u22652) was associated with ambulance crews including at least one paramedic (odds ratio [OR] 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14 to 2.04, p\u202f<\u202f0.01), with any recorded pain score and suspected cardiac pain (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.02 to 4.75). Intravenous morphine administration was also more likely where crews included a paramedic (OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.93 to 4.13, P\u202f<\u202f0.01), attending patients aged 51 to 64\u202fyears (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.21 to 3.45, p\u202f=\u202f0.01), in moderate to severe (NVPS 4-10) compared with lower levels of pain for any clinical condition group compared with the reference condition.There was no association between patient sex or ambulance staff sex or grade and analgesic administration or pain reduction.","229":"We develop a theory for transit times and mean ages for nonautonomous compartmental systems. Using the McKendrick-von F\u00f6rster equation, we show that the mean ages of mass in a compartmental system satisfy a linear nonautonomous ordinary differential equation that is exponentially stable. We then define a nonautonomous version of transit time as the mean age of mass leaving the compartmental system at a particular time and show that our nonautonomous theory generalises the autonomous case. We apply these results to study a nine-dimensional nonautonomous compartmental system modeling the terrestrial carbon cycle, which is a modification of the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach model, and we demonstrate that the nonautonomous versions of transit time and mean age differ significantly from the autonomous quantities when calculated for that model.","230":"SignificanceHuman breast milk is the nutritional food source evolved specifically to meet the needs of infants, but much remains to be learned about its composition and changes over the course of lactation. Our description of the cellular components of breast milk, their associations with maternal-infant dyad metadata, and quantification of alterations at the gene and pathway levels provide a longitudinal picture of human breast milk cells across lactational time. These results pave the way for improved therapeutic support of healthy lactation and milk production.","231":"The Program for Resistance, Immunology, Surveillance, and Modeling of Malaria (PRISM) has been conducting malaria research in Uganda since 2010 to improve the understanding of the disease and measure the impact of population-level control interventions in the country. Here, we will summarize key research findings from a series of studies addressing routine health facility-based surveillance, comprehensive cohort studies, studies of the molecular epidemiology, and transmission of malaria, evaluation of antimalarial drug efficacy, and resistance across the country, and assessments of insecticide resistance. Among our key findings are the following. First, we found that in historically high transmission areas of Uganda, a combination of universal distribution of long-lasting insecticidal-treated nets (LLINs) and sustained indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticides lowered the malaria burden greatly, but marked resurgences occurred if IRS was discontinued. Second, submicroscopic infections are common and key drivers of malaria transmission, especially in school-age children (5-15 years). Third, markers of drug resistance have changed over time, with new concerning emergence of markers predicting resistance to artemisinin antimalarials. Fourth, insecticide resistance monitoring has demonstrated high levels of resistance to pyrethroids, appreciable impact of the synergist piperonyl butoxide to pyrethroid susceptibility, emerging resistance to carbamates, and complete susceptibility of malaria vectors to organophosphates, which could have important implications for vector control interventions. Overall, PRISM has yielded a wealth of information informing researchers and policy-makers on the malaria burden and opportunities for improved malaria control and eventual elimination in Uganda. Continued studies concerning all the types of surveillance discussed above are ongoing.","232":"Of 100 new diagnoses during 2021-2022, 52 individuals clustered, of whom only 31% were reinterviewed. Reinterviewing did not improve contact tracing beyond initial interviews, and the study was stopped early for futility. Clustering concordance within the phylogenetic ensemble was high (88%-89%), but lower (74%) for HIV-TRACE. Despite hypothesis rejection, we established a public health-academic partnership, developed a bioinformatics pipeline enabling near real-time cluster analysis, and identified gaps and unique opportunities for intervention.Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a global challenge and novel measures for transmission disruption are needed. Contact tracing is limited by reluctance or inability of newly diagnosed individuals to name at-risk contacts. Molecular cluster analysis is mostly used for outbreak investigations, and its role in routine public health activities remains uncertain.We conducted a 2-year prospective statewide study in Rhode Island to evaluate integration of HIV cluster analyses into routine contact tracing, by attempting to reinterview all new diagnoses who clustered, notifying them of clustering, and evaluating benefits of this strategy. Clustering was compared between a phylogenetic ensemble versus distance-based HIV-TRACE.Attempting to reinterview all statewide new HIV diagnoses in molecular clusters showed no evidence of improving contact tracing. However, a strong academic-public health partnership enabled near real-time, longitudinal integration of molecular cluster analysis into routine public health activities, and identified barriers and opportunities tailoring data-driven approaches to unique individual and community characteristics, guiding future work on optimal use of molecular epidemiology to disrupt HIV transmission.","233":"Although empirical studies show that protection against influenza infection in humans is closely related to antibody titres, influenza epidemics are often described under the assumption that individuals are either susceptible or not. Here we develop a model in which antibody titre classes are enumerated explicitly and mapped onto a variable scale of susceptibility in different age groups. Fitting only with pre- and post-wave serological data during 2009 pandemic in Hong Kong, we demonstrate that with stratified immunity, the timing and the magnitude of the epidemic dynamics can be reconstructed more accurately than is possible with binary seropositivity data. We also show that increased infectiousness of children relative to adults and age-specific mixing are required to reproduce age-specific seroprevalence observed in Hong Kong, while pre-existing immunity in the elderly is not. Overall, our results suggest that stratified immunity in an aged-structured heterogeneous population plays a significant role in determining the shape of influenza epidemics.","234":", which normally facilitates crossing the intestinal barrier during the initial stages of infection. We hypothesized that (i) natural exposure to virulence-attenuated (vA) Lm strains through food can confer protective immunity against listeriosis attributable to fully virulent (fV) strains and (ii) current food safety measures to minimize exposure to both Lm strains may have adverse population-level outcomes. To test these hypotheses, we evaluated the host response to Lm in a mouse infection model and through mathematical modelling in a human population. After oral immunization with a murinized vA Lm strain, we demonstrated the elicitation of a CD8+ T-cell response and protection against subsequent challenge with an fV strain. A two-strain compartmental mathematical model of human exposure to Lm with cross-protective immunity was also developed. If food safety testing strategies preferentially identify and remove food contaminated by vA strains (potentially due to their common occurrence in foods and higher concentration in food compared to fV strains), the model predicted minimal public health benefit to potentially adverse effects. For example, reducing vA exposures by half, while maintaining fV exposures results in an approximately 6% rise in annual incidence.","235":"Dispersal is a key force in the assembly of fungal communities and the air is the dominant route of dispersal for most fungi. Understanding the dynamics of airborne fungi is important for determining their source and for helping to prevent fungal disease. This understanding is important in the San Joaquin Valley of California, which is home to 4.2 million people and where the airborne fungus Coccidioides is responsible for the most important fungal disease of otherwise healthy humans, coccidioidomycosis. The San Joaquin Valley is the most productive agricultural region in the United States, with the principal crops grown therein susceptible to fungal pathogens. Here, we characterize the fungal community in soil and air on undeveloped and agricultural land in the San Joaquin Valley using metabarcoding of the internal transcribed spacer 2 variable region of fungal rDNA. Using 1002 individual samples, we report one of the most extensive studies of fungi sampled simultaneously from air and soil using modern sequencing techniques. We find that the air mycobiome in the San Joaquin Valley is distinct from the soil mycobiome, and that the assemblages of airborne fungi from sites as far apart as 160km are far more similar to one another than to the fungal communities in nearby soils. Additionally, we present evidence that airborne fungi in the San Joaquin Valley are subject to dispersal limitation and cyclical intra-annual patterns of community composition. Our findings are broadly applicable to understanding the dispersal of airborne fungi and the taxonomic structure of airborne fungal assemblages.","236":"With the advent of rapid multiplex PCR, physicians have been able to test for multiple viral pathogens when a patient presents with influenza-like illness. This has led to the discovery that many respiratory infections are caused by more than one virus. Antiviral treatment of viral coinfections can be complex because treatment of one virus will affect the time course of the other virus. Since effective antivirals are only available for some respiratory viruses, careful consideration needs to be given on the effect treating one virus will have on the dynamics of the other virus, which might not have available antiviral treatment. In this study, we use mathematical models of viral coinfections to assess the effect of antiviral treatment on coinfections. We examine the effect of the mechanism of action, relative growth rates of the viruses, and the assumptions underlying the interaction of the viruses. We find that high antiviral efficacy is needed to suppress both infections. If high doses of both antivirals are not achieved, then we run the risk of lengthening the duration of coinfection or even of allowing a suppressed virus to replicate to higher viral titers.","237":"In sub-Saharan Africa many people who inject drugs (PWID) are living with undiagnosed or untreated HIV and experience high levels of poverty and conditions that can contribute to worse outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Identifying the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection in marginalized populations like PWID may contribute to controlling the pandemic.The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 of 30.9% in this cohort suggests high transmission rates within this population. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was similar for people living with and without HIV. A large portion of this population was noted to have had disruption in access to harm reduction services.One\u00a0thousand participants were enrolled between April and July 2021, of whom 323 (32.3%) were women and 677 (67.7%) were men. Median age of participants was 36\u00a0years (interquartile range: 30, 42). SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity was found in 309 (30.9%) participants. Disruption in obtaining methadone service was reported by 106 (24.3%) of the participants. Men were significantly less likely than women to have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]\u2009=\u20090.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51, 0.95; p\u2009<\u20090.01) Participants who reported a sexual or injecting partner diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 were twofold more likely to have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detected (aOR\u2009=\u20092.21, 95% CI 1.06, 4.58; p\u2009<\u20090.032). Living with HIV was\u00a0not associated with presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.This is a nested cross-sectional study within an ongoing cohort study that recruits PWID living with HIV and their injecting and\/or sexual partners at needle and syringe program sites and methadone clinics in Kenya. Blood samples were collected from consenting participants at enrollment to determine SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a Platellia BioRad SARS-CoV-2 total antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Baseline data were collected on HIV status, antiretroviral therapy and methadone adherence. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with antibody positivity and descriptive statistics to report SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence.","238":"The current COVID-19 pandemic has impacted cities particularly hard. Here, we provide an in-depth characterization of disease incidence and mortality, and their dependence on demographic and socioeconomic strata in Santiago, a highly segregated city and the capital of Chile. Our analyses show a strong association between socioeconomic status and both COVID-19 outcomes and public health capacity. People living in municipalities with low socioeconomic status did not reduce their mobility during lockdowns as much as those in more affluent municipalities. Testing volumes may have been insufficient early in the pandemic in those places, and both test positivity rates and testing delays were much higher. We find a strong association between socioeconomic status and mortality, measured either by COVID-19 attributed deaths or excess deaths. Finally, we show that infection fatality rates in young people are higher in low-income municipalities. Together, these results highlight the critical consequences of socioeconomic inequalities on health outcomes.","239":"Studies of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have reported varying estimates of epidemiological parameters including serial interval distributions, i.e., the time between illness onset in successive cases in a transmission chain, and reproduction numbers. By compiling a line-list database of transmission pairs in mainland China, we show that mean serial intervals of COVID-19 have shortened substantially from 7.8 days to 2.6 days within a month (January 9 to February 13, 2020). This change is driven by enhanced non-pharmaceutical interventions, in particular case isolation. We also show that using real-time estimation of serial intervals allowing for variation over time, provides more accurate estimates of reproduction numbers than using conventionally fixed serial interval distributions. These findings could improve assessment of transmission dynamics, forecasting future incidence, and estimating the impact of control measures.","240":"This study evaluates the scale-free network assumption commonly used in COVID-19 epidemiology, using empirical social network data from SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant molecular local clusters in Houston, Texas. We constructed genome-informed social networks from contact and co-residence data, tested them for scale-free power-law distributions that imply highly connected hubs, and compared them to alternative models (exponential, log-normal, power-law with exponential cutoff, and Weibull) that suggest more evenly distributed network connections. Although the power-law model failed the goodness of fit test, after incorporating social network ties, the power-law model was at least as good as, if not better than, the alternatives, implying the presence of both hub and non-hub mechanisms in local SARS-CoV-2 transmission. These findings enhance our understanding of the complex social interactions that drive SARS-CoV-2 transmission, thereby informing more effective public health interventions.","241":"Purpose Scientists in the speech, language, and hearing sciences rely on statistical analyses to help reveal complex relationships and patterns in the data collected from their research studies. However, data from studies in the fields of communication sciences and disorders rarely conform to the underlying assumptions of many traditional statistical methods. Fortunately, the field of statistics provides many mature statistical techniques that can be used to meet today's challenges involving complex studies of behavioral data from humans. In this review article, we highlight several techniques and general approaches with promising application to analyses in the speech and hearing sciences. Method The goal of this review article is to provide an overview of potentially underutilized statistical methods with promising application in the speech, language, and hearing sciences. Results We offer suggestions to identify when alternative statistical approaches might be advantageous when analyzing proportion data and repeated measures data. We also introduce the Bayesian paradigm and statistical learning and offer suggestions for when a scientist might consider those methods. Conclusion Modern statistical techniques provide more flexibility and enable scientists to ask more direct and informative research questions.","242":" ), and (3) policy interventions. The low number of cases have led some SSA governments to relaxing these policy interventions. Will this result in a resurgence of cases? To understand how to interpret the lower-than-expected COVID-19 case data in Madagascar, we use a simple age-structured model to explore each of these explanations and predict the epidemic impact associated with them. We show that the incidence of COVID-19 cases as of July 2020 can be explained by any combination of the late introduction of first imported cases, early implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), and low case detection rates. We then re-evaluate these findings in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic in Madagascar through August 2020. This analysis reinforces that Madagascar, along with other countries in SSA, remains at risk of a growing health crisis. If NPIs remain enforced, up to 50,000 lives may be saved. Even with NPIs, without vaccines and new therapies, COVID-19 could infect up to 30% of the population, making it the largest public health threat in Madagascar for the coming year, hence the importance of clinical trials and continually improving access to healthcare.","243":"We developed a compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to estimate the COVID-19 case burden for all African countries while considering four scenarios: no intervention, moderate lockdown, hard lockdown and hard lockdown with continued restrictions once lockdown is lifted. We further analysed the potential impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations affected by HIV\/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB).The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly spreading across the African continent. Estimates of the potential impact of interventions and burden of disease are essential for policymakers to make evidence-based decisions on the distribution of limited resources and to balance the economic costs of interventions with the potential for saving lives.As of 13 January 2021, there have been 3\u2009113\u2009963 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 and 74\u2009619 deaths across the African continent. Despite relatively lower numbers of cases initially, many African countries are now experiencing an exponential increase in case numbers. Estimates of the progression of disease and potential impact of different interventions are needed to inform policymaking decisions. Herein, we model the possible trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in 52 African countries under different intervention scenarios.In the absence of an intervention, the most populous countries had the highest peaks in active projected number of infections with Nigeria having an estimated 645\u2009081 severe infections. The scenario with a hard lockdown and continued post-lockdown interventions to reduce transmission was the most efficacious strategy for delaying the time to the peak and reducing the number of cases. In South Africa, projected peak severe infections increase from 162\u2009977 to 2\u200903\u2009261, when vulnerable populations with HIV\/AIDS and TB are included in the analysis.","244":"We found a considerable direct cost resulting from the care of preterm newborns. Extreme prematurity showed a cost 15.5 times higher than late prematurity. We also verified that a greater number of prenatal consultations and gestational age were associated with a reduction in the costs of prematurity.A total of 147 preterm newborns were included. We verified an average cost of BRL 1,120 for late preterm infants, BRL 6,688 for moderate preterm infants, and BRL 17,395 for extremely preterm infants. We also observed that factors associated with the cost were gestational age (B = -123.00; 95%CI: -241.60 to -4.50); hospitalization in neonatal ICU (B = 6,932.70; 95%CI: 5,309.40-8,556.00), and number of prenatal consultations (B = -227.70; 95%CI: -403.30 to -52.00).This is a cost-of-illness study, with data extracted from hospital admission authorization forms and medical records of a large public hospital in the Federal District, Brazil. The association of characteristics of preterm newborns and mothers with costs was estimated by linear regression with gamma distribution. In the analysis, the calculation of the parameters of the estimates (B), with a confidence interval of 95% (95%CI), was adopted. The uncertainty parameters were estimated by the 95% confidence interval and standard error using the Bootstrapping method, with 1,000 samples. Deterministic sensitivity analysis was performed, considering lower and upper limits of 95%CI in the variation of each cost component.To estimate the direct costs due to hospital care for extremely, moderate, and late preterm newborns, from the perspective of a public hospital in 2018. The second objective was to investigate whether factors associated with birth and maternal conditions explain the costs and length of hospital stay.","245":"Movement behavior is an important contributor to habitat selection and its incorporation in disease risk models has been somewhat neglected. The habitat preferences of host individuals affect their probability of exposure to pathogens. If preference behavior can be incorporated in ecological niche models (ENMs) when data on pathogen distributions are available, then variation in such behavior may dramatically impact exposure risk. Here we use data from the anthrax endemic system of Etosha National Park, Namibia, to demonstrate how integrating inferred movement behavior alters the construction of disease risk maps. We used a Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model that associated soil, bioclimatic, and vegetation variables with the best available pathogen presence data collected at anthrax carcass sites to map areas of most likely Bacillus anthracis (the causative bacterium of anthrax) persistence. We then used a hidden Markov model (HMM) to distinguish foraging and non-foraging behavioral states along the movement tracks of nine zebra (Equus quagga) during the 2009 and 2010 anthrax seasons. The resulting tracks, decomposed on the basis of the inferred behavioral state, formed the basis of step-selection functions (SSFs) that used the MaxEnt output as a potential predictor variable. Our analyses revealed different risks of exposure during different zebra behavioral states, which were obscured when the full movement tracks were analyzed without consideration of the underlying behavioral states of individuals. Pathogen (or vector) distribution models may be misleading with regard to the actual risk faced by host animal populations when specific behavioral states are not explicitly accounted for in selection analyses. To more accurately evaluate exposure risk, especially in the case of environmentally transmitted pathogens, selection functions could be built for each identified behavioral state and then used to assess the comparative exposure risk across relevant states. The scale of data collection and analysis, however, introduces complexities and limitations for consideration when interpreting results.","246":"We present a standalone Matlab software platform complete with visualization for the reconstruction of the neural activity in the brain from MEG or EEG data. The underlying inversion combines hierarchical Bayesian models and Krylov subspace iterative least squares solvers. The Bayesian framework of the underlying inversion algorithm allows to account for anatomical information and possible a priori belief about the focality of the reconstruction. The computational efficiency makes the software suitable for the reconstruction of lengthy time series on standard computing equipment. The algorithm requires minimal user provided input parameters, although the user can express the desired focality and accuracy of the solution. The code has been designed so as to favor the parallelization performed automatically by Matlab, according to the resources of the host computer. We demonstrate the flexibility of the platform by reconstructing activity patterns with supports of different sizes from MEG and EEG data. Moreover, we show that the software reconstructs well activity patches located either in the subcortical brain structures or on the cortex. The inverse solver and visualization modules can be used either individually or in combination. We also provide a version of the inverse solver that can be used within Brainstorm toolbox. All the software is available online by Github, including the Brainstorm plugin, with accompanying documentation and test data.","247":"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is characterized by disabling joint pain that can cause persistent arthritis in approximately one-fourth of patients. Currently, no standard treatments are available for chronic CHIKV arthritis. Our preliminary data suggest that decreases in interleukin-2 (IL2) levels and regulatory T cell (Treg) function may play a role in CHIKV arthritis pathogenesis. Low-dose IL2-based therapies for autoimmune diseases have been shown to up-regulate Tregs, and complexing IL2 with anti-IL2 antibodies can prolong the half-life of IL2. A mouse model for post-CHIKV arthritis was used to test the effects of recombinant IL2 (rIL2), an anti-IL2 monoclonal antibody (mAb), and the complex on tarsal joint inflammation, peripheral IL2 levels, Tregs, CD4\u2009+\u2009effector T cells\u00a0(Teff), and histological disease scoring. The complex treatment resulted in the highest levels of IL2 and Tregs, but also increased Teffs, and therefore did not significantly reduce inflammation or disease scores. However, the antibody group, which had moderately increased levels of IL2 and activated Tregs, resulted in a decreased average disease score. These results suggest the rIL2\/anti-IL2 complex stimulates both Tregs and Teffs in post-CHIKV arthritis, while the anti-IL2 mAb increases IL2 availability enough to shift the immune environment towards a tolerogenic one.","248":"Species competing for resources also commonly share predators. While competition often drives divergence between species, the effects of shared predation are less understood. Theoretically, competing prey species could either diverge or evolve in the same direction under shared predation depending on the strength and symmetry of their interactions. We took an empirical approach to this question, comparing antipredator and trophic phenotypes between sympatric and allopatric populations of threespine stickleback and prickly sculpin fish that all live in the presence of a trout predator. We found divergence in antipredator traits between the species: in sympatry, antipredator adaptations were relatively increased in stickleback but decreased in sculpin. Shifts in feeding morphology, diet and habitat use were also divergent but driven primarily by stickleback evolution. Our results suggest that asymmetric ecological character displacement indirectly made stickleback more and sculpin less vulnerable to shared predation, driving divergence of antipredator traits between sympatric species.","249":"Control strategies that employ real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for the diagnosis and surveillance of COVID-19 epidemic are inefficient in fighting the epidemic due to high cost, delays in obtaining results, and the need of specialized personnel and equipment for laboratory processing. Cheaper and faster alternatives, such as antigen and paper-strip tests, have been proposed. They return results rapidly, but have lower sensitivity thresholds for detecting virus. To quantify the effects of the tradeoffs between sensitivity, cost, testing frequency, and delay in test return on the overall course of an outbreak, we built a multi-scale immuno-epidemiological model that connects the virus profile of infected individuals with transmission and testing at the population level. We investigated various randomized testing strategies and found that, for fixed testing capacity, lower sensitivity tests with shorter return delays slightly flatten the daily incidence curve and delay the time to the peak daily incidence. However, compared with RT-PCR testing, they do not always reduce the cumulative case count at half a year into the outbreak. When testing frequency is increased to account for the lower cost of less sensitive tests, we observe a large reduction in cumulative case counts, from 55.4% to as low as 1.22% half a year into the outbreak. The improvement is preserved even when the testing budget is reduced by one half or one third. Our results predict that surveillance testing that employs low-sensitivity tests at high frequency is an effective tool for epidemic control.","250":" in samples where viral RNA was detected. Fluctuations in population normalized loading rates in several of the WWTP service areas agreed with known outbreaks during the study. Here we propose several ways that data can be presented spatially and temporally to be of greatest use to public health officials. As the COVID-19 pandemic wanes, it is likely that communities will see increased incidence of small, localized outbreaks. In these instances, WBE could be used as a pre-screening tool to better target clinical testing needs in communities with limited resources.","251":"Rectal douching may put MSM at increased risk for infection with HIV and other STIs. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify this association, and health education materials should inform men of the potential for increased risk of infection with rectal douching.Twenty-eight eligible studies were identified in our review, of which 24 (20 398 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. Rectal douching was associated with increased odds of infection with HIV (OR 2.80, 95% CI 2.32 to 3.39), and any STI other than HIV (including hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and human papillomavirus) (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.95 to 3.11) among MSM. For specific STIs, douching was associated with increased odds of viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV) (OR 3.29, 95% CI 2.79 to 3.87), and chlamydia or gonorrhoea (OR 3.25, 95% CI 2.02 to 5.23). These associations remained significant in studies that adjusted for potential confounders.We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science for studies published from January 1970 to November 2018. Studies that reported ORs and 95% CIs of associations between rectal douching and infection with HIV\/STIs, or reported enough data to calculate these estimates, were included. We assessed risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. ORs were pooled using a random effects model.Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV and other STIs worldwide. Rectal douching, which is commonly used by MSM in preparation for anal sex, may increase the risk of HIV and other STIs by injuring the rectal mucosa. Results from individual studies reporting associations between rectal douching and HIV and other STIs among MSM are inconsistent. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the association between rectal douching and HIV and other STIs among MSM.","252":"More than half of respondents reported problems of pain\/discomfort, while over a quarter reported problems of anxiety\/depression. The average index value was 0.84. Women reported more problems on all dimensions, but particularly on anxiety\/depression and pain\/discomfort, resulting in significantly lower index values. Problems with mobility, self-care, and usual activities showed a sharp increase after the age of 80\u00a0years. Consequently, index values decreased significantly by age. Lower education was associated with a higher prevalence of problems for all dimensions except anxiety\/depression and with a significantly lower index value.The BHIS 2018 provided EQ-5D-5L data for a nationally representative sample of the Belgian population. The dimension scores and index values were analyzed using logistic and linear regressions, respectively, accounting for the survey design.This paper presents the first nationally representative Belgian population norms using the EQ-5D-5L. Inclusion of the EQ-5D in future surveys will allow monitoring over time of self-reported health, disease burden, and health inequalities.Health-related quality of life outcomes are increasingly used to monitor population health and health inequalities and to assess the (cost-) effectiveness of health interventions. The EQ-5D-5L has been included in the Belgian Health Interview Survey, providing a new source of population-based self-perceived health status information. This study aims to estimate Belgian population norms for the EQ-5D-5L by sex, age, and region and to analyze its association with educational attainment.","253":"There is limited data on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) evolutionary trends in African populations. We evaluated changes in HIV viral diversity and genetic divergence in southern Uganda over a 24-year period spanning the introduction and scale-up of HIV prevention and treatment programs using HIV sequence and survey data from the Rakai Community Cohort Study, an open longitudinal population-based HIV surveillance cohort. Gag (p24) and env (gp41) HIV data were generated from people living with HIV (PLHIV) in 31 inland semi-urban trading and agrarian communities (1994-2018) and four hyperendemic Lake Victoria fishing communities (2011-2018) under continuous surveillance. HIV subtype was assigned using the Recombination Identification Program with phylogenetic confirmation. Inter-subtype diversity was evaluated using the Shannon diversity index, and intra-subtype diversity with the nucleotide diversity and pairwise TN93 genetic distance. Genetic divergence was measured using root-to-tip distance and pairwise TN93 genetic distance analyses. Demographic history of HIV was inferred using a coalescent-based Bayesian Skygrid model. Evolutionary dynamics were assessed among demographic and behavioral population subgroups, including by migration status. 9931 HIV sequences were available from 4999 PLHIV, including 3060 and 1939 persons residing in inland and fishing communities, respectively. In inland communities, subtype A1 viruses proportionately increased from 14.3% in 1995 to 25.9% in 2017 (P\u2009<\u2009.001), while those of subtype D declined from 73.2% in 1995 to 28.2% in 2017 (P\u2009<\u2009.001). The proportion of viruses classified as recombinants significantly increased by nearly four-fold from 12.2% in 1995 to 44.8% in 2017. Inter-subtype HIV diversity has generally increased. While intra-subtype p24 genetic diversity and divergence leveled off after 2014, intra-subtype gp41 diversity, effective population size, and divergence increased through 2017. Intra- and inter-subtype viral diversity increased across all demographic and behavioral population subgroups, including among individuals with no recent migration history or extra-community sexual partners. This study provides insights into population-level HIV evolutionary dynamics following the scale-up of HIV prevention and treatment programs. Continued molecular surveillance may provide a better understanding of the dynamics driving population HIV evolution and yield important insights for epidemic control and vaccine development.","254":"In this work, we present and discuss the approaches, that are used for modeling and surveillance of dynamics of infectious diseases by considering the early stage asymptomatic and later stage symptomatic infections. We highlight the conceptual ideas and mathematical tools needed for such infectious disease modeling. We compute the basic reproduction number of the proposed model and investigate the qualitative behaviours of the infectious disease model such as, local and global stability of equilibria for the non-delayed as well as delayed system. At the end, we perform numerical simulations to validate the effectiveness of the derived results.","255":"To assess the serologic response to all EBV peptides before the first symptoms of MS occur, determine whether the disease is associated with a distinct immune response to EBV, and evaluate whether specific EBV epitopes drive this response.It remains unclear why only a small proportion of individuals infected with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) develop multiple sclerosis (MS) and what the underlying mechanisms are.Rate ratios (RRs) for MS for antibodies to 2263 EBV peptides (the EBV peptidome) were estimated using conditional logistic regression, adjusting for total anti-EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) antibodies, which have consistently been associated with a higher MS risk. The role of antibodies against other viral peptides was also explored.In this prospective, nested case-control study, individuals were selected among US military personnel with serum samples stored in the US Department of Defense Serum Repository. Individuals with MS had serum collected at a median 1 year before onset (reported to the military in 2000-2011) and were matched to controls for age, sex, race and ethnicity, blood collection, and military branch. No individuals were excluded. The data were analyzed between September 1, 2022, and August 31, 2023.A total of 30 individuals with MS were matched with 30 controls. Mean (SD) age at sample collection was 27.8 (6.5) years; 46 of 60 participants (76.7%) were male. The antibody response to the EBV peptidome was stronger in individuals with MS, but without a discernible pattern. The antibody responses to 66 EBV peptides, the majority mapping to EBNA antigens, were significantly higher in preonset sera from individuals with MS (RR of highest vs lowest tertile of antibody enrichment, 33.4; 95% CI, 2.5-448.4; P for trend\u2009=\u2009.008). Higher total anti-EBNA-1 antibodies were also associated with an elevated MS risk (top vs bottom tertile: RR, 27.6; 95% CI, 2.3-327.6; P for trend\u2009=\u2009.008). After adjusting for total anti-EBNA-1 antibodies, risk estimates from most EBV peptides analyses were attenuated, with 4 remaining significantly associated with MS, the strongest within EBNA-6\/EBNA-3C, while the association between total anti-EBNA-1 antibodies and MS persisted.Antibodies (enrichment z scores) to the human virome measured using VirScan (phage-displayed immunoprecipitation and sequencing).These findings suggest that antibody response to EBNA-1 may be the strongest serologic risk factor for MS. No single EBV peptide stood out as being selectively targeted in individuals with MS but not controls. Larger investigations are needed to explore possible heterogeneity of anti-EBV humoral immunity in MS.","256":" across the Refuge, while December through March were less favorable months. Likewise, significant differences in suitability were observed between the two grazing areas. The suitability map provided here could also be used to make management decisions, such as monitoring horses for lesions during high risk months.","257":"From October 2021\u2500June 2022, study sites in seven states enrolled patients aged \u22656 months presenting with acute respiratory illness. Respiratory specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2. In blood specimens, we measured concentrations of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against the ancestral strain spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (N) antigens in standardized binding antibody units (BAU\/mL). Percent change in odds of COVID-19 by increasing anti-RBD bAb was estimated using logistic regression as (1-adjusted odds ratio of COVID-19)x100, adjusting for COVID-19 mRNA vaccine doses, age, site, and high-risk exposure.Out of 2018 symptomatic patients, 662 (33%) tested positive for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Geometric mean RBD bAb levels were lower among COVID-19 cases than SARS-CoV-2 test-negative controls during the Delta-predominant period (112 vs 498 BAU\/mL) and Omicron-predominant period (823 vs 1189 BAU\/mL). Acute-phase ancestral spike RBD bAb levels associated with 50% lower odds of COVID-19 were 1968 BAU\/mL against Delta and 3375 BAU\/mL against Omicron; thresholds may differ in other laboratories.We assessed associations between binding antibody (bAb) concentration <5 days from symptom onset and testing positive for COVID-19 among patients in a test-negative study.During acute illness, antibody concentrations against ancestral spike RBD were associated with protection against COVID-19.","258":"Understanding the process of adaptation during rapid environmental change remains one of the central focal points of evolutionary biology. The recently formed White Sands system of southern New Mexico offers an outstanding example of rapid adaptation, with a variety of species having rapidly evolved blanched forms on the dunes that contrast with their close relatives in the surrounding dark soil habitat. In this study, we focus on two of the White Sands lizard species, Sceloporus cowlesi and Aspidoscelis inornata, for which previous research has linked mutations in the melanocortin-1 receptor gene (Mc1r) to blanched coloration. We sampled populations both on and off the dunes and used a custom sequence capture assay based on probed fosmid libraries to obtain >50 kb of sequence around Mc1r and hundreds of other random genomic locations. We then used model-based statistical inference methods to describe the demographic and adaptive history characterizing the colonization of White Sands. We identified a number of similarities between the two focal species, including strong evidence of selection in the blanched populations in the Mc1r region. We also found important differences between the species, suggesting different colonization times, different genetic architecture underlying the blanched phenotype and different ages of the beneficial alleles. Finally, the beneficial allele is dominant in S. cowlesi and recessive in A. inornata, allowing for a rare empirical test of theoretically expected patterns of selective sweeps under these differing models.","259":"A cohort of YBMSM (n = 618) was generated through respondent-driven sampling. Frequency of marijuana use and marijuana use as a sex-drug were assessed across the HIV care continuum using weighted logistic regression models.Little data exists on how substances most commonly used by YBMSM, such as marijuana, are related to the HIV continuum, which represents the primary aim of this study.Study participants reported more intermittent marijuana use (n = 254, 56.2%) compared to heavy use (n = 198, 43.8%). Our sample contained 212 (34.3%) HIV seropositive participants of which 52 (24.5%) were unaware of their HIV positive status. Study participants who were heavy marijuana users were more likely to be unaware of their HIV seropositive status (AOR: 4.18; 95% CI 1.26, 13.89). All other stages in the care continuum demonstrated no significant differences between those who use marijuana intermittently or heavily or as a sex-drug and nonusers.Young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) are at highest risk for HIV seroconversion in the United States. Successful movement through the HIV care continuum is an important intervention for limiting onwards HIV transmission.YBMSM who used marijuana heavily were more likely to be HIV-positive unaware than those who never used marijuana. Findings were inconclusive regarding the relationships between marijuana use and other HIV care continuum metrics. However, knowledge of ones' HIV status is a critical requirement for engaging in care and may have implications for onwards HIV transmission.","260":"Among the several means by which heterogeneity can be modeled, Levins' (1969) meta-population approach preserves the most analytical tractability, a virtue to the extent that generality is desirable. When model populations are stratified, contacts among their respective sub-populations must be described. Using a simple meta-population model, Feng et al. (2015) showed that mixing among sub-populations, as well as heterogeneity in characteristics affecting sub-population reproduction numbers, must be considered when evaluating public health interventions to prevent or control infectious disease outbreaks. They employed the convex combination of preferential within- and proportional among-group contacts first described by Nold (1980) and subsequently generalized by Jacquez et al. (1988). As the utility of meta-population modeling depends on more realistic mixing functions, the authors added preferential contacts between parents and children and among co-workers (Glasser et al., 2012). Here they further generalize this function by including preferential contacts between grandparents and grandchildren, but omit workplace contacts. They also describe a general multi-level mixing scheme, provide three two-level examples, and apply two of them. In their first application, the authors describe age- and gender-specific patterns in face-to-face conversations (Mossong et al., 2008), proxies for contacts by which respiratory pathogens might be transmitted, that are consistent with everyday experience. This suggests that meta-population models with inter-generational mixing could be employed to evaluate prolonged school-closures, a proposed pandemic mitigation measure that could expose grandparents, and other elderly surrogate caregivers for working parents, to infectious children. In their second application, the authors use a meta-population SEIR model stratified by 7 age groups and 50 states plus the District of Columbia, to compare actual with optimal vaccination during the 2009-2010 influenza pandemic in the United States. They also show that vaccination efforts could have been adjusted month-to-month during the fall of 2009 to ensure maximum impact. Such applications inspire confidence in the reliability of meta-population modeling in support of public health policymaking.","261":"For all sites combined, VE was statistically significant every season against all influenza and against the predominant circulating strains (VE\u00a0=\u00a019%-50%) Few differences among four sites in the US Flu VE Network were evident in five seasons. However, in 2015-16, overall VE in one site was 24% (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-4%-44%), while VE in two other sites was significantly higher (61%, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a049%-71%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.002, and 53%, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a033,67; P\u00a0=\u00a0.034).Analyses were conducted on 27\u00a0180 outpatients \u22656\u00a0months old presenting with an acute respiratory infection (ARI) with cough of \u22647-day duration during the 2011-2016 influenza seasons. A test-negative design was used with vaccination status defined as receipt of \u22651 dose of any influenza vaccine according to medical records, registries, and\/or self-report. Influenza infection was determined by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. VE estimates were calculated using odds ratios from multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, race\/ethnicity, time from illness onset to enrollment, high-risk conditions, calendar time, and vaccination status-site interaction.With few exceptions, site-specific VE estimates aligned with each other and overall VE estimates. Observed VE may reflect inherent differences in community characteristics of the sites and highlights the importance of diverse settings for studying influenza vaccine effectiveness.Influenza vaccination is recommended for all US residents aged \u22656\u00a0months. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) varies by age, circulating influenza strains, and the presence of high-risk medical conditions. We examined site-specific VE in the US Influenza VE Network, which evaluates annual influenza VE at ambulatory clinics in geographically diverse sites.","262":"Anthropogenic modifications to the landscape have altered several ecological processes worldwide, creating new ecological boundaries at the human\/wildlife interface. Outbreaks of zoonotic pathogens often occur at these ecological boundaries, but the mechanisms behind new emergences remain drastically understudied. Here, we test for the influence of two types of ecosystem boundaries on spillover risk: (1) biotic transition zones such as species range edges and transitions between ecoregions and (2) land use transition zones where wild landscapes occur in close proximity to heavily impacted areas of high human population density. Using ebolavirus as a model system and an ensemble machine learning modeling framework, we investigated the role of likely reservoir (bats) and accidental host (primates) range edges and patterns of land use (defined using SEDAC categories) on past spillover events. Our results show that overlapping species range edges and heightened habitat diversity increase ebolavirus outbreaks risk. Moreover, we show that gradual transition zones, represent by high proportion of rangelands, acts as a buffer to reduces outbreak risks. With increasing landscape changes worldwide, we provide novel ecological and evolutionary insights into our understanding of zoonotic pathogen emergence and highlight the risk of aggressively developing ecological boundaries.","263":"The use of yeast systems to study the propagation of prions and amyloids has emerged as a crucial aspect of the global endeavor to understand those mechanisms. Yeast prion systems are intrinsically multi-scale: the molecular chemical processes are indeed coupled to the cellular processes of cell growth and division to influence phenotypical traits, observable at the scale of colonies. We introduce a novel modeling framework to tackle this difficulty using impulsive differential equations. We apply this approach to the [PSI+] yeast prion, which is associated with the misconformation and aggregation of Sup35. We build a model that reproduces and unifies previously conflicting experimental observations on [PSI+] and thus sheds light onto characteristics of the intracellular molecular processes driving aggregate replication. In particular our model uncovers a kinetic barrier for aggregate replication at low densities, meaning the change between prion or prion-free phenotype is a bi-stable transition. This result is based on the study of prion curing experiments, as well as the phenomenon of colony sectoring, a phenotype which is often ignored in experimental assays and has never been modeled. Furthermore, our results provide further insight into the effect of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) on Sup35 aggregates. To qualitatively reproduce the GdnHCl curing experiment, aggregate replication must not be completely inhibited, which suggests the existence of a mechanism different than Hsp104-mediated fragmentation. Those results are promising for further development of the [PSI+] model, but also for extending the use of this novel framework to other yeast prion or amyloid systems.","264":"In the United States, new tuberculosis cases are increasingly concentrated within non-native-born populations. We estimated trends and differences in tuberculosis incidence rates for the non-U.S.-born population, at a resolution unobtainable from raw data. We obtained non-U.S.-born tuberculosis case reports for 2000-2016 from the National Tuberculosis Surveillance System, and population data from the American Community Survey and 2000 U.S. Census. We constructed generalized additive regression models to estimate incidence rates in terms of birth country, entry year, age at entry, and number of years since entry into the United States and described how these factors contribute to overall tuberculosis risk. Controlling for other factors, tuberculosis incidence rates were lower for more recent immigration cohorts, with an incidence risk ratio (IRR) of 10.2 (95 % confidence interval 7.0, 14.7) for the 1950 entry cohort compared to its 2016 counterpart. Greater years since entry and younger age at entry were associated with substantially lower incidence rates. IRRs for birth country varied between 8.86 (6.78, 11.52) for Somalia and 0.02 (0.01, 0.03) for Canada, compared to all non-U.S.-born residents in 2016. IRRs were positively correlated with WHO predicted incidence rate and negatively associated with wealth level for the birth country. Lower country wealth level was also associated with shallower declines in tuberculosis over time. Tuberculosis risks differ by several orders of magnitude within the non-U.S.-born population. A better understanding of these differences will allow more effective targeting of tuberculosis prevention efforts. The methods presented here may also be relevant for understanding tuberculosis trends in other high-income countries.","265":"How does the public want a COVID-19 vaccine to be allocated? We conducted a conjoint experiment asking 15,536 adults in 13 countries to evaluate 248,576 profiles of potential vaccine recipients who varied randomly on five attributes. Our sample includes diverse countries from all continents. The results suggest that in addition to giving priority to health workers and to those at high risk, the public favors giving priority to a broad range of key workers and to those with lower income. These preferences are similar across respondents of different education levels, incomes, and political ideologies, as well as across most surveyed countries. The public favored COVID-19 vaccines being allocated solely via government programs but were highly polarized in some developed countries on whether taking a vaccine should be mandatory. There is a consensus among the public on many aspects of COVID-19 vaccination, which needs to be taken into account when developing and communicating rollout strategies.","266":"The wide spectrum of vectors is contributing substantially to the increasing incidence of SFGR infections among humans. Awareness, diagnosis, and surveillance of SFGR infections should be improved in the high-risk regions, especially in areas where human infections are underreported.Emerging and re-emerging spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsioses are increasingly recognised worldwide as threats to public health, yet their global distribution and associated risk burden remain poorly understood.In this systematic review and modelling analysis, we mapped global distributions of all confirmed species of SFG rickettsiae (SFGR) detected in animals, vectors, and human beings, using data collected from the literature. We assessed ecological drivers for the distributions of 17 major SFGR species using machine learning algorithms, and mapped model-predicted risks.Between Jan 1, 1906, and March 31, 2021, we found reports of 48 confirmed SFGR species, with 66\u2009133 human infections worldwide, with a large spatial variation across the continents. 198 vector species were detected to carry 47 of these Rickettsia spp. (146 ticks, 24 fleas, 15 mosquitoes, six mites, four lice, two keds, and one bug). Based on model-predicted global distributions of the 17 major SFGR species, we found five spatial clusters aggregated by ecological similarity in terms of environmental and ecoclimatic features. Rickettsia felis is the leading SFGR species to which 4\u00b74 billion (95% CI 3\u00b78-5\u00b73 billion) people are at risk, followed by Rickettsia conorii (3\u00b77 billion) and Rickettsia africae (3\u00b76 billion).National Key Research and Development Program of China.","267":"The results demonstrated that adding medication regimen complexity variables (model II) and the MRC-ICU score (model III) improved inpatient mortality prediction.. The LC outperformed the other classifiers (KNN and NB), with an overall accuracy of 83%, sensitivity (Se) of 87%, specificity of 67%, positive predictive value of 93%, and negative predictive value of 46%. The APACHE III score and the MRC-ICU score at the 24-hour interval were the 2 most important variables.Inclusion of the MRC-ICU score improved the prediction of patient outcomes on the previously established APACHE III score. This novel, proof-of-concept methodology shows promise for future application of the MRC-ICU scoring tool for patient outcome predictions.The Medication Regimen Complexity -Intensive Care Unit (MRC-ICU) is the first tool for measuring medication regimen complexity in critically ill patients. This study tested machine learning (ML) models to investigate the relationship between medication regimen complexity and patient outcomes.This study was a single-center, retrospective observational evaluation of 130 adults admitted to the medical ICU. The MRC-ICU score was utilized to improve the inpatient model's prediction accuracy. Three models were proposed: model I, demographic data without medication data; model II, demographic data and medication regimen complexity variables; and model III: demographic data and the MRC-ICU score. A total of 6 ML classifiers was developed: k-nearest neighbor (KNN), na\u00efve Bayes (NB), random forest, support vector machine, neural network, and logistic classifier (LC). They were developed and tested using electronic health record data to predict inpatient mortality.","268":"Pain is a common phenomenon. Patients with somatoform pain disorder (SPD) suffer from lasting chronic pain which may cause cognitive impairment. The dysfunction of prefrontal cortex (PFC) may be involved in pain-induced cognition impairment, which is the most important part in regulating of cognitive function. Multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive and low-cost functional neuroimaging technique being used to detect the prefrontal cortex activation during cognitive tasks to demonstrate the relationship between PFC dysfunction and cognition impairment in SPD patients.24 patients with SPD and 24 age-, gender- and education level-matched healthy controls were examined by NIRS of the relative concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) in PFC during verbal fluency task (VFT). All data analysis procedures were accomplished under MATLAB, SPM and SPM-fNIRS which is an SPM12-based software for fNIRS analysis.1. The number of words generated during the VFT tasks in SPD patients were fewer than healthy controls. 2. The activated areas in SPD patients were smaller than healthy controls. 3. The average activation strength of [oxy-Hb] in SPD patients was much lower than healthy controls. 4. The difference of activation areas between left and right lobe were particularly obvious in SPD patients.There are evidences suggested that the markedly dysfunction in PFC especially bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) areas may be involved in the cognitive deficiency in patients with SPD.","269":"In the era of social media, every day billions of individuals produce content in socio-technical systems resulting in a deluge of information. However, human attention is a limited resource and it is increasingly challenging to consume the most suitable content for one's interests. In fact, the complex interplay between individual and social activities in social systems overwhelmed by information results in bursty activity of collective attention which are still poorly understood. Here, we tackle this challenge by analyzing the online activity of millions of users in a popular microblogging platform during exceptional events, from NBA Finals to the elections of Pope Francis and the discovery of gravitational waves. We observe extreme fluctuations in collective attention that we are able to characterize and explain by considering the co-occurrence of two fundamental factors: the heterogeneity of social interactions and the preferential attention towards influential users. Our findings demonstrate how combining simple mechanisms provides a route towards understanding complex social phenomena.","270":"Epidemic data are often difficult to interpret due to inconsistent detection and reporting. As these data are critically relied upon to inform policy and epidemic projections, understanding reporting trends is similarly important. Early reporting of the COVID-19 pandemic in particular is complicated, due to changing diagnostic and testing protocols. An internal audit by the State of Florida, USA found numerous specific examples of irregularities in COVID-19 case and death reports. Using case, hospitalization, and death data from the the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Florida, we present approaches that can be used to identify the timing, direction, and magnitude of some reporting changes. Specifically, by establishing a baseline of detection probabilities from the first (spring) wave, we show that transmission trends among all age groups were similar, with the exception of the second summer wave, when younger people became infected earlier than seniors, by approximately 2 weeks. We also found a substantial drop in case-fatality risk (CFR) among all age groups over the three waves during the first year of the pandemic, with the most drastic changes seen in the 0 to 39 age group. The CFR trends provide useful insights into infection detection that would not be possible by relying on the number of tests alone. During the third wave, for which we have reliable hospitalization data, the CFR was remarkably stable across all age groups. In contrast, the hospitalization-to-case ratio varied inversely with cases while the death-to-hospitalization ratio varied proportionally. Although specific trends are likely to vary between locales, the approaches we present here offer a generic way to understand the substantial changes that occurred in the relationships among the key epidemic indicators.","271":"Coccidioidomycosis is a predominantly respiratory infection of animals and humans caused by soil-dwelling fungi. Long known to be endemic to North American deserts, locally acquired human cases first emerged in Washington State in 2010. To inform development of an environmental niche map, we conducted an ecological cross-sectional study of the association between soil and climactic variables and canine seroprevalence in Washington State, at the zip code tabulation area level. Soil predictors included soil texture (per cent sand, silt and clay), pH, electrical conductivity and water storage capacity; climactic predictors included mean annual air temperature and liquid precipitation. Clustering was evaluated with Moran's I, and four modelling approaches were adopted a priori: two models without any smoothing (logistic regression and quasi-logistic regression) and two smoothing models (non-spatial and spatial smoothing). No evidence was found for clustering, and both smoothing models resulted in marked attenuation of all coefficients. Temperature was found to have a positive effect in the non-smoothing models (prevalence odds ratio, logistic model: 1.70, 95% confidence interval 1.02, 2.84). While no other significant associations were found, there was suggestive evidence of a positive effect for pH. Despite the limitations inherent to the ecological and cross-sectional nature of these data, these findings provide insight for the development of an environmental niche map in Washington State and demonstrate the utility of using data from an animal sentinel to predict human disease risk.","272":"There is an increasing global burden from chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Bangladesh reported a major epidemic in 2017, however, it was unclear if there had been prior widespread transmission. We conducted a nationally representative seroprevalence survey in 70 randomly selected communities immediately prior to the epidemic. We found 69\/2,938 (2.4%) of sampled individuals were seropositive to CHIKV. Being seropositive to dengue virus (aOR 3.13 [95% CIs: 1.86-5.27]), male sex (aOR 0.59 [95% CIs: 0.36-0.99]), and community presence of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (aOR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.05-3.07) were significantly associated with CHIKV seropositivity. Using a spatial prediction model, we estimated that across the country, 4.99 (95% CI: 4.89 - 5.08) million people had been previously infected. These findings highlight high population susceptibility prior to the major outbreak and that previous outbreaks must have been spatially isolated.","273":"Tetrapods (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) are model systems for global biodiversity science, but continuing data gaps, limited data standardisation, and ongoing flux in taxonomic nomenclature constrain integrative research on this group and potentially cause biased inference. We combined and harmonised taxonomic, spatial, phylogenetic, and attribute data with phylogeny-based multiple imputation to provide a comprehensive data resource (TetrapodTraits 1.0.0) that includes values, predictions, and sources for body size, activity time, micro- and macrohabitat, ecosystem, threat status, biogeography, insularity, environmental preferences, and human influence, for all 33,281 tetrapod species covered in recent fully sampled phylogenies. We assess gaps and biases across taxa and space, finding that shared data missing in attribute values increased with taxon-level completeness and richness across clades. Prediction of missing attribute values using multiple imputation revealed substantial changes in estimated macroecological patterns. These results highlight biases incurred by nonrandom missingness and strategies to best address them. While there is an obvious need for further data collection and updates, our phylogeny-informed database of tetrapod traits can support a more comprehensive representation of tetrapod species and their attributes in ecology, evolution, and conservation research.","274":"Dengue is a vector-borne disease that is endemic to several countries, including the Dominican Republic, which has experienced dengue outbreaks for over four decades. With outbreaks growing in incidence in recent years, it is becoming increasingly important to develop better tools to understand drivers of dengue transmission. Such tools are critical for providing timely information to assist healthcare authorities in preparing human, material, and medical resources for outbreaks. Here, we investigate associations between meteorological variables and dengue transmission in the Dominican Republic in 2019, the year in which the country\u2019s largest outbreak to date ocurred. We apply generalized linear mixed modelling with gamma family and log link to model the weekly dengue incidence rate. Because correlations in lags between climate variables and dengue cases exhibited different behaviour among provinces, a backward-type selection method was executed to find a final model with lags in the explanatory variables. We find that in the best models, meteorological conditions such as temperature and rainfall have an impact with a delay of 2\u20135 weeks in the development of an outbreak, ensuring breeding conditions for mosquitoes.","275":"Interventions to protect young infants against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are in advanced phases of development and are expected to be available in the foreseeable future. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, included maternal vaccines and infant monoclonal antibodies for RSV as part of the 2018 vaccine investment strategy (VIS) and decided to support these products subject to licensure, World Health Organization prequalification, Strategic Advisory Group of Experts recommendation, and meeting the financial assumptions used as the basis of the investment case. Impact estimates reported in this manuscript were used to inform the Gavi VIS.We compared two independent vaccine impact models to evaluate a potential maternal RSV vaccine's impact on infant health in 73 Gavi-supported countries. Key inputs were harmonized across both models. We analyzed various scenarios to evaluate the effect of uncertain model parameters such as vaccine efficacy, duration of infant protection, and infant disease burden. Estimates of averted cases, severe cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were calculated over the 2023-2035 horizon.RSV maternal immunization is projected to substantially reduce mortality and morbidity among young infants if introduced across Gavi-supported countries.This work was supported by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus Consortium in Europe. The findings and conclusions contained within are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect positions or policies of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation or of the Respiratory Syncytial Virus Consortium. LW is supported by Research Foundation-Flanders (1234620\u00a0N).A maternal RSV vaccine with 60% efficacy offering 5\u00a0months of infant protection implemented across 73 low- and middle-income countries could avert 10.1-12.5 million cases, 2.8-4.0 million hospitalizations, 123.7-177.7 thousand deaths, and 8.5-11.9 million DALYs among infants under 6\u00a0months of age for the duration of analysis (2023-2035). Maternal RSV vaccination was projected to avert up to 42% of estimated RSV deaths among infants under 6\u00a0months in year 2035. Alternative scenario analyses with higher disease burden assumptions showed that a maternal vaccine could avert as many as 325-355 thousand deaths among infants under 6\u00a0months.","276":" Whilst the Cascade Analysis Tool is still in the early stages of existence, it has already shown promise in preliminary applications, and we believe there is potential for it to help make sense of the increasing quantities of data on cascades.","277":"A major question in clinical science is how to study the natural course of a chronic disease from inception to end, which is challenging because it is impractical to follow patients over decades. Here, we developed BETR (Bayesian entry time realignment), a hierarchical Bayesian method for investigating the long-term natural history of diseases using data from patients followed over short durations. A simulation study shows that BETR outperforms an existing method that ignores patient-level variation in progression rates. BETR, when combined with a common Bayesian model comparison tool, can identify the correct disease progression function nearly 100% of the time, with high accuracy in estimating the individual disease durations and progression rates. Application of BETR in patients with geographic atrophy, a disease with a known natural history model, shows that it can identify the correct disease progression model. Applying BETR in patients with Huntington's disease demonstrates that the progression of motor symptoms follows a second order function over approximately 20\u00a0years.","278":"Modern molecular technologies have revolutionized our understanding of bacterial epidemiology, but reported data across studies and different geographic endemic settings remain under-integrated in common theoretical frameworks. Pneumococcus serotype co-colonization, caused by the polymorphic bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, has been increasingly investigated and reported in recent years. While the global genomic diversity and serotype distribution of S. pneumoniae have been well-characterized, there is limited information on how co-colonization patterns vary globally, critical for understanding the evolution and transmission dynamics of the bacteria. Gathering a rich dataset of cross-sectional pneumococcal colonization studies in the literature, we quantified patterns of transmission intensity and co-colonization prevalence variation in children populations across 17 geographic locations. Fitting these data to an SIS model with cocolonization under the assumption of quasi-neutrality among multiple interacting strains, our analysis reveals strong patterns of negative co-variation between transmission intensity (R0) and susceptibility to co-colonization (k). In line with expectations from the stress-gradient-hypothesis in ecology (SGH), pneumococcus serotypes appear to compete more in co-colonization in high-transmission settings and compete less in low-transmission settings, a trade-off which ultimately leads to a conserved ratio of single to co-colonization \u03bc=1\/(R0-1)k. As expected from the mathematical model's behavior, such conservation suggests preservation of 'stability-diversity-complexity' regimes in coexistence of similar co-colonizing strains. We find no major differences in serotype compositions across studies, pointing to adaptation of the same set of serotypes across variable environments as an explanation for their differential interaction in different transmission settings. Our work highlights that the understanding of transmission patterns of Streptococcus pneumoniae from global scale epidemiological data can benefit from simple analytical approaches that account for quasi-neutrality among strains, co-colonization, as well as variable environmental adaptation.","279":"While the focus of many in the vaccine world has been on developing new vaccines and measuring their effects on humans, failure to understand and properly address vaccine supply chain issues can greatly reduce the impact of any vaccine. Therefore, everyone involved in vaccine decision-making may want to take into account supply chains when making key decisions. In fact, considering supply chain issues long before a vaccine reaches the market can help design vaccines and vaccine programs that better match the system. We detail how vaccine supply chains may affect the work and decision making of ten examples of different members of the vaccine community: preclinical vaccinologists, vaccine clinical trialists, vaccine package designers, health care workers, epidemiologists and disease surveillance experts, policy makers, storage equipment manufacturers, other technology developers, information system specialists, and funders. We offer ten recommendations to help decision makers better understand and address supply chains.","280":"Annual incidence rates of varicella infection in the general population in France have been rather stable since 1991 when clinical surveillance started. Rates however show a statistically significant increase over time in children aged 0-3 years, and a decline in older individuals. A significant increase in day-care enrolment and structures' capacity in France was also observed in the last decade. In this work we investigate the potential interplay between an increase of contacts of young children possibly caused by earlier socialization in the community and varicella transmission dynamics. To this aim, we develop an age-structured mathematical model, informed with historical demographic data and contact matrix estimates in the country, accounting for longitudinal linear increase of early childhood contacts. While the reported overall varicella incidence is well reproduced independently of mixing variations, age-specific empirical trends are better captured by accounting for an increase in contacts among pre-school children in the last decades. We found that the varicella data are consistent with a 30% increase in the number of contacts at day-care facilities, which would imply a 50% growth in the contribution of 0-3y old children to overall yearly infections in 1991-2015. Our findings suggest that an earlier exposure to pathogens due to changes in day-care contact patterns, represents a plausible explanation for the epidemiological patterns observed in France. Obtained results suggest that considering temporal changes in social factors in addition to demographic ones is critical to correctly interpret varicella transmission dynamics.","281":"The human skeletal form underlies our ability to walk on two legs, but unlike standing height, the genetic basis of limb lengths and skeletal proportions is less well understood. Here we applied a deep learning model to 31,221 whole body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) images from the UK Biobank (UKB) to extract 23 different image-derived phenotypes (IDPs) that include all long bone lengths as well as hip and shoulder width, which we analyzed while controlling for height. All skeletal proportions are highly heritable (\u00e2\u02c6\u00bc40-50%), and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of these traits identified 179 independent loci, of which 102 loci were not associated with height. These loci are enriched in genes regulating skeletal development as well as associated with rare human skeletal diseases and abnormal mouse skeletal phenotypes. Genetic correlation and genomic structural equation modeling indicated that limb proportions exhibited strong genetic sharing but were genetically independent of width and torso proportions. Phenotypic and polygenic risk score analyses identified specific associations between osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip and knee, the leading causes of adult disability in the United States, and skeletal proportions of the corresponding regions. We also found genomic evidence of evolutionary change in arm-to-leg and hip-width proportions in humans consistent with striking anatomical changes in these skeletal proportions in the hominin fossil record. In contrast to cardiovascular, auto-immune, metabolic, and other categories of traits, loci associated with these skeletal proportions are significantly enriched in human accelerated regions (HARs), and regulatory elements of genes differentially expressed through development between humans and the great apes. Taken together, our work validates the use of deep learning models on DXA images to identify novel and specific genetic variants affecting the human skeletal form and ties a major evolutionary facet of human anatomical change to pathogenesis.","282":"The self-quarantine noncompliance rate for COVID-19 was examined using publicly available data. We collected the daily number of quarantine and quarantine violation cases from March 22 to June 10, 2020. A Poisson regression analysis was conducted to identify the impact of additional sanctions for the quarantine violation.The additional sanction for the violation of quarantined individuals did not reduce the self-quarantine violations. Further studies are warranted to strengthen the compliance of self-quarantine for future pandemics.In South Korea, many individuals were self-quarantined for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after the quarantine criteria were extended to all overseas travelers. This study was conducted to identify the noncompliance rate of self-quarantine for COVID-19 cases and assess the impact of a 1-strike out policy and an increased amount of penalty for the violating self-quarantine in South Korea.The median number of individuals quarantined per day was 36,561 (interquartile range, 34,408-41,961). The median number of daily self-quarantine violations was 6 (range, 0-13). The median rate of self-quarantine violations was 1.6 per 10,000 self-quarantined individuals (range, 0.0-8.0 per 10,000 self-quarantined individuals). The additional sanction has no significant impact on the number of violations among quarantine individuals (P = 0.99).","283":"Preterm birth affects nearly 10% of all pregnancies in the United States, with 40% of those due, in part, to infections. Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS) is one of the most common perinatal pathogens responsible for these infections. Current therapeutic techniques aimed to ameliorate invasive GBS infections are less than desirable and can result in complications in both the neonate and the mother. To this end, the need for novel therapeutic options is urgent. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), an integral component of human breast milk, have been previously shown to possess antiadhesive and antimicrobial properties. To interrogate these characteristics, we examined HMO-mediated outcomes in both in vivo and ex vivo models of GBS infection utilizing a murine model of ascending GBS infection, an EpiVaginal human organoid tissue model, and ex vivo human gestational membranes. Supplementation of HMOs resulted in diminished adverse pregnancy outcomes, decreased GBS adherence to gestational tissues, decreased colonization within the reproductive tract, and reduced proinflammatory immune responses to GBS infection. Taken together, these results highlight the potential of HMOs as promising therapeutic interventions in perinatal health.","284":"To report the results of an intervention using the 4 Pillars\u2122 Practice Transformation Program (4 Pillars\u2122 Program) to increase adolescent vaccinations including human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV) and influenza vaccines, which remain underutilized in this population.Among 9473 patients ages 11-17years at baseline (4\/1\/2015), mean pre-intervention vaccination rates for HPV initiation and completion, meningococcal, Tdap and influenza vaccines were below national levels. Rates increased significantly post intervention (P<0.001) for HPV initiation which increased 17.1 percentage points (PP) from 51.4%; HPV completion increased 14.8PP from 30.7%, meningococcal vaccine uptake increased 16.6PP from 79.1%, Tdap vaccine uptake increased 14.6PP from 76.9%. Influenza vaccine uptake did not increase significantly (2.3PP from 40.1%). In the regression using generalized estimating equations, odds of vaccination were higher for younger, non-white adolescents for all vaccines; being in a smaller practice decreased the odds of Tdap vaccination but increased the odds of influenza vaccination.Eleven pediatric and family medicine practices, previously control sites from a randomized controlled cluster trial, with \u226550 adolescent patients participated. The 4 Pillars\u2122 Program was the foundation of the intervention. De-identified demographic, office visit and vaccination data were derived from electronic medical record extractions for patients whose date of birth was 4\/1\/1997 to 4\/1\/2004 (ages 11-17years at baseline). Vaccination rates for HPV, influenza, tetanus-pertussis-diphtheria (Tdap) and meningococcal (MenACWY) vaccines were determined for all eligible patients pre- and post intervention (i.e., vaccination rates on 4\/1\/2015 and 4\/30\/2016).Clinically and statistically significant improvements in HPV series initiation and completion, and meningococcal and Tdap vaccinations were observed in primary care practices implementing the 4 Pillars\u2122 Practice Transformation Program. Clinical Trial Registry Number: NCT02165722.","285":"The debilitating effect of traumatic brain injury (TBI) extends years after the initial injury and hampers the recovery process and quality of life. In this study, we explore the functional reorganization of the default mode network (DMN) of those affected with non-severe TBI. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a wide-spectrum disease that has heterogeneous effects on its victims and impacts everyday functioning. The functional disruption of the default mode network (DMN) after TBI has been established, but its link to causal effective connectivity remains to be explored. This study investigated the differences in the DMN between healthy participants and mild and moderate TBI, in terms of functional and effective connectivity using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Nineteen non-severe TBI (mean age 30.84 \u00b1 14.56) and twenty-two healthy (HC; mean age 27.23 \u00b1 6.32) participants were recruited for this study. Resting-state fMRI data were obtained at the subacute phase (mean days 40.63 \u00b1 10.14) and analyzed for functional activation and connectivity, independent component analysis, and effective connectivity within and between the DMN. Neuropsychological tests were also performed to assess the cognitive and memory domains. Compared to the HC, the TBI group exhibited lower activation in the thalamus, as well as significant functional hypoconnectivity between DMN and LN. Within the DMN nodes, decreased activations were detected in the left inferior parietal lobule, precuneus, and right superior frontal gyrus. Altered effective connectivities were also observed in the TBI group and were linked to the diminished activation in the left parietal region and precuneus. With regard to intra-DMN connectivity within the TBI group, positive correlations were found in verbal and visual memory with the language network, while a negative correlation was found in the cognitive domain with the visual network. Our results suggested that aberrant activities and functional connectivities within the DMN and with other RSNs were accompanied by the altered effective connectivities in the TBI group. These alterations were associated with impaired cognitive and memory domains in the TBI group, in particular within the language domain. These findings may provide insight for future TBI observational and interventional research.","286":"Background: Significant mitigation efforts beyond the Nationally Determined Commitments (NDCs) coming out of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement are required to avoid warming of 2\u2009\u00b0C above pre-industrial temperatures. Health co-benefits represent selected near term, positive consequences of climate policies that can offset mitigation costs in the short term before the beneficial impacts of those policies on the magnitude of climate change are evident. The diversity of approaches to modeling mitigation options and their health effects inhibits meta-analyses and syntheses of results useful in policy-making.\r\n\r\nMethods\/Design: We evaluated the range of methods and choices in modeling health co-benefits of climate mitigation to identify opportunities for increased consistency and collaboration that could better inform policy-making. We reviewed studies quantifying the health co-benefits of climate change mitigation related to air quality, transportation, and diet published since the 2009 Lancet Commission 'Managing the health effects of climate change' through January 2017. We documented approaches, methods, scenarios, health-related exposures, and health outcomes.\r\n\r\nResults\/Synthesis: Forty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. Air quality, transportation, and diet scenarios ranged from specific policy proposals to hypothetical scenarios, and from global recommendations to stakeholder-informed local guidance. Geographic and temporal scope as well as validity of scenarios determined policy relevance. More recent studies tended to use more sophisticated methods to address complexity in the relevant policy system.\r\n\r\nDiscussion: Most studies indicated significant, nearer term, local ancillary health benefits providing impetus for policy uptake and net cost savings. However, studies were more suited to describing the interaction of climate policy and health and the magnitude of potential outcomes than to providing specific accurate estimates of health co-benefits. Modeling the health co-benefits of climate policy provides policy-relevant information when the scenarios are reasonable, relevant, and thorough, and the model adequately addresses complexity. Greater consistency in selected modeling choices across the health co-benefits of climate mitigation research would facilitate evaluation of mitigation options particularly as they apply to the NDCs and promote policy uptake.","287":"In a prospective observational study, two doses of BNT162b2 were effective against confirmed and probable Beta infections. Through the end of June 2021, introductions of Beta did not interrupt control of the pandemic in Israel.Israel Ministry of Health and Pfizer.SARS-CoV-2 variant Beta (B.1.351) was designated as a Variant of Concern (VoC) after becoming the dominant strain in South Africa and spreading internationally. BNT162b2 showed lower levels of neutralizing antibodies against Beta than against other strains raising concerns about effectiveness of vaccines against infections caused by Beta. We estimated BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against Beta infections in Israel, a country with high vaccine uptake.MoH identified 310 Beta cases through Jun 27, 2021. During the study period (Dec 11, 2020 - Mar 25, 2021), 164 non-institutionalized primary Beta cases, with 552 contacts aged \u226516 years, were identified. 343\/552 (62%) contacts were interviewed and tested. 71\/343 (21%) contacts were PCR-positive. WGS was performed on 7\/71 (10%) PCR-positive specimens; all were Beta. Among SARS-CoV-2-infected contacts, 48\/71 (68%) were symptomatic, 10\/71 (14%) hospitalized, and 2\/71 (3%) died. Fully-vaccinated VE against confirmed or probable Beta infections was 72% (95% CI -5 - 97%; p=0\u00b704) and against symptomatic confirmed or probable Beta infections was 100% (95% CI 19 - 100%; p=0\u00b701). There was no evidence of protection in partially-vaccinated contacts.The Ministry of Health (MoH) identified Beta cases through mandatory reporting of SARS-CoV-2 cases and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of specimens from vaccination-breakthrough infections, reinfections, arriving international travelers, and a selection of other infected persons. A cohort analysis was conducted of exposure events of contacts of primary Beta cases. WGS was conducted on available PCR-positive specimens collected from contacts. VE estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) against confirmed and probable Beta infections were determined by comparing infection risk between unvaccinated and fully-vaccinated (\u22657 days after the second dose) contacts, and between unvaccinated and partially-vaccinated (<7 days after the second dose) contacts.","288":"Although the prevalence of hepatitis C virus Ab at the emergency department was higher than previously estimated for the general population in Belgium, the number of newly diagnosed patients with viremia was low. To optimize screening strategies, screening should be offered to males born in the 1955-1974 cohort, but especially in drug users, the prison population and immigrants from high endemic countries.Of 2970 patients, 2366 (79.7%) agreed to participate. hepatitis C virus Ab prevalence was 1.31%. Twenty-one (67.7%) hepatitis C virus Ab-positive patients were born between 1955 and 1974. With a previous treatment uptake of 54.5%, the prevalence of viremia was 0.9% in retrospect; 0.2% were newly diagnosed. The weighted multiple logistic regression model identified males born in the 1955-1974 cohort, intravenous drug use and high endemic birth country as significant risk factors for hepatitis C virus infection (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).Patients are not screened adequately for hepatitis C virus infection in Belgium. In the USA, the Center for Disease Control recommends screening for patients born in the babyboom period (1945-1965). In Europe, the babyboom cohort was born between 1955 and 1974, but no screening policy has been targeted to this group. We aimed to study the prevalence of hepatitis C virus in an emergency department population in Belgium and the risk factors associated with hepatitis C virus infection.We performed a monocentric, cross-sectional seroprevalence study between January and November 2017 in a large Belgian non-university hospital. Patients aged 18-70\u00a0years presenting at the emergency department were eligible. Patients completed a risk assessment questionnaire and were screened for hepatitis C virus antibodies (Ab) with reflex hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid testing.","289":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging pathogen, first recognized in 2012, with a high case fatality risk, no vaccine, and no treatment beyond supportive care. We estimated the relative risks of death and severe disease among MERS-CoV patients in the Middle East between 2012 and 2015 for several risk factors, using Poisson regression with robust variance and a bootstrap-based expectation maximization algorithm to handle extensive missing data. Increased age and underlying comorbidity were risk factors for both death and severe disease, while cases arising in Saudi Arabia were more likely to be severe. Cases occurring later in the emergence of MERS-CoV and among health-care workers were less serious. This study represents an attempt to estimate risk factors for an emerging infectious disease using open data and to address some of the uncertainty surrounding MERS-CoV epidemiology.","290":"We use a validated mathematical model to evaluate the reduction of incident cases, hospitalized cases, and deaths in the United States through 2033 under various levels of vaccination and treatment coverage. We assume that future seasonal transmission patterns for COVID-19 will be similar to those of influenza virus. We account for the waning of infection-induced immunity and vaccine-induced immunity in a future with stable COVID-19 dynamics. Due to uncertainty in the duration of immunity following vaccination or infection, we consider two exponentially-distributed waning rates, with means of 365 days (one year) and 548 days (1.5 years). We also consider treatment failure, including rebound frequency, as a possible treatment outcome.As expected, universal vaccination is projected to eliminate transmission and mortality. Under current treatment coverage (13.7%) and vaccination coverage (49%), averages of 89,000 annual deaths (548-day waning) and 120,000 annual deaths (365-day waning) are expected by the end of this decade. Annual mortality in the United States can be reduced below 50,000 per year with >81% annual vaccination coverage, and below 10,000 annual deaths with >84% annual vaccination coverage. Universal treatment reduces hospitalizations by 88% and deaths by 93% under current vaccination coverage. A reduction in vaccination coverage requires a comparatively larger increase in treatment coverage in order for hospitalization and mortality levels to remain unchanged.As we enter the fourth year of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 infections still cause high morbidity and mortality in the United States. During 2020-2022, COVID-19 was one of the leading causes of death in the United States and by far the leading cause among infectious diseases. Vaccination uptake remains low despite this being an effective burden reducing intervention. The development of COVID-19 therapeutics provides hope for mitigating severe clinical outcomes. This modeling study examines combined strategies of vaccination and treatment to reduce the burden of COVID-19 epidemics over the next decade.Adopting universal vaccination and universal treatment goals in the United States will likely lead to a COVID-19 mortality burden below 50,000 deaths per year, a burden comparable to that of influenza virus.","291":"Collectively migrating Xenopus mesendoderm cells are arranged into leader and follower rows with distinct adhesive properties and protrusive behaviors. In vivo, leading row mesendoderm cells extend polarized protrusions and migrate along a fibronectin matrix assembled by blastocoel roof cells. Traction stresses generated at the leading row result in the pulling forward of attached follower row cells. Mesendoderm explants removed from embryos provide an experimentally tractable system for characterizing collective cell movements and behaviors, yet the cellular mechanisms responsible for this mode of migration remain elusive. We introduce a novel agent-based computational model of migrating mesendoderm in the Cellular-Potts computational framework to investigate the respective contributions of multiple parameters specific to the behaviors of leader and follower row cells. Sensitivity analyses identify cohesotaxis, tissue geometry, and cell intercalation as key parameters affecting the migration velocity of collectively migrating cells. The model predicts that cohesotaxis and tissue geometry in combination promote cooperative migration of leader cells resulting in increased migration velocity of the collective. Radial intercalation of cells towards the substrate is an additional mechanism contributing to an increase in migratory speed of the tissue. Model outcomes are validated experimentally using mesendoderm tissue explants.","292":"Crop switching, in which farmers grow a crop that is novel to a given field, can help agricultural systems adapt to changing environmental, cultural, and market forces. Yet while regional crop production trends receive significant attention, relatively little is known about the local-scale crop switching that underlies these macrotrends. We characterized local crop-switching patterns across the United States using the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Cropland Data Layer, an annual time series of high resolution (30 m pixel size) remote-sensed cropland data from 2008 to 2022. We found that at multiple spatial scales, crop switching was most common in sparsely cultivated landscapes and in landscapes with high crop diversity, whereas it was low in homogeneous, highly agricultural areas such as the Midwestern corn belt, suggesting a number of potential social and economic mechanisms influencing farmers' crop choices. Crop-switching rates were high overall, occurring on more than 6% of all US cropland in the average year. Applying a framework that classified crop switches based on their temporal novelty (crop introduction versus discontinuation), spatial novelty (locally divergent versus convergent switching), and categorical novelty (transformative versus incremental switching), we found distinct spatial patterns for these three novelty dimensions, indicating a dynamic and multifaceted set of cropping changes across US farms. Collectively, these results suggest that innovation through crop switching is playing out very differently in various parts of the country, with potentially significant implications for the resilience of agricultural systems to changes in climate and other systemic trends.","293":null,"294":"Vector control methods are considered effective in averting dengue transmission. However, several factors may modify their impact. Of these controls, chemical methods, in the long run, may increase mosquitoes' resistance to chemicides, thereby decreasing control efficacy. The biological methods, which may be self-sustaining and very effective, could be hampered by seasonality or heatwaves (resulting in, e.g., loss of Wolbachia infection). The environmental methods that could be more effective than the chemical methods are under-investigated. In this study, a systematic review is conducted to explore the present understanding of the effectiveness of vector control approaches via dengue transmission models.","295":"Viral coinfections are responsible for a significant portion of cases of patients hospitalized with influenza-like illness. As our awareness of viral coinfections has increased, researchers have started to experimentally examine some of the virus-virus interactions underlying these infections. One mechanism of interaction between viruses is through the innate immune response. This seems to occur primarily through the interferon response, which generates an antiviral state in nearby uninfected cells, a phenomenon know as the bystander effect. Here, we develop a mathematical model of two viruses interacting through the bystander effect. We find that when the rate of removal of cells to the protected state is high, growth of the first virus is suppressed, while the second virus enjoys sole access to the protected cells, enhancing its growth. Conversely, growth of the second virus can be fully suppressed if its ability to infect the protected cells is limited.","296":"Exposure to ozone was associated with an increased risk of gestational hypertension or eclampsia, especially during 2 to 4\u00a0months after conception.We included 2,393,346 normotensive mothers aged from 18 to 50\u00a0years old who had a live singleton birth documented in the National Vital Statistics system in the US in 2002. We obtained information on gestational hypertension and eclampsia from birth certificates. We estimated daily ozone concentrations from a spatiotemporal ensemble model. We used distributed lag model and logistic regression to estimate the association between monthly ozone exposure and risk of gestational hypertension or eclampsia after adjusting for individual-level covariates and county poverty rate.Of the 2,393,346 pregnant women, there were 79,174 women with gestational hypertension and 6034 with eclampsia. A 10 parts per billion (ppb) increase in ozone was associated with an increased risk of gestational hypertension over 1-3\u00a0months before conception (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.042, 95\u00a0% CI: 1.029, 1.056), 2-3\u00a0months after conception (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.058, 95\u00a0% CI: 1.040, 1.077), and 3-5\u00a0months after conception (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.031, 95\u00a0% CI: 1.018, 1.044). The corresponding OR for eclampsia was 1.115 (95\u00a0% CI: 1.074, 1.158), 1.048 (95\u00a0% CI: 1.020, 1.077), and 1.070 (95\u00a0% CI: 1.032, 1.110), respectively.Exposure to ambient ozone during pregnancy may be linked with hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, but evidence is largely unknown. We aimed to estimate the association between maternal exposure to ozone and risk of gestational hypertension and eclampsia in the contiguous United States (US).","297":"A quantitative survey of human movement patterns was conducted in four countries in sub-Saharan Africa: Mali, Burkina Faso, Zambia, and Tanzania, with three to five survey locations chosen in each country. Questions were included on demographic and trip details, malaria risk behaviour, children accompanying travellers, and mobile phone usage to enable phone signal data to be better correlated with movement. A total of 4352 individuals were interviewed and 6411 trips recorded.Women travelling with children were a remarkably consistent traveller group across all four countries surveyed. They are expected to contribute greatly towards spatial malaria transmission because the children they travel with tend to have high parasite prevalence. Youth workers were a significant traveller group in Mali and are expected to contribute greatly to spatial malaria transmission because their movements correlate with seasonal rains and hence peak mosquito densities. Interventions aimed at interrupting spatial transmission of parasites should consider these traveller groups.As malaria prevalence declines in many parts of the world due to widescale control efforts and as drug-resistant parasites begin to emerge, a quantitative understanding of human movement is becoming increasingly relevant to malaria control. However, despite its importance, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding human movement, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.A cluster analysis of trips highlighted two distinct traveller groups of relevance to malaria transmission: women travelling with children (in all four countries) and youth workers (in Mali). Women travelling with children were more likely to travel to areas of relatively high malaria prevalence in Mali (OR = 4.46, 95% CI = 3.42-5.83), Burkina Faso (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.23-1.58), Zambia (OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.20-1.89), and Tanzania (OR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.71-3.05) compared to other travellers. They were also more likely to own bed nets in Burkina Faso (OR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.25-2.53) and Zambia (OR = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.34 2.27), and less likely to own a mobile phone in Mali (OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.39-0.65), Burkina Faso (OR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.30-0.52), and Zambia (OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.47-0.76). Malian youth workers were more likely to travel to areas of relatively high malaria prevalence (OR = 23, 95% CI = 17-31) and for longer durations (mean of 70 days cf 21 days, p < 0.001) compared to other travellers.","298":"Compared with men with no recent group sex experience, those reporting group sex in the 3 months before the survey (30.7% of the sample) were more likely to have had condomless receptive anal sex at least once in the same period [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.1-2.4, P = 0.02], condomless insertive anal sex (aOR=2.0, 95%CI: 2.4-8.7, P < 0.001) and substance use before or during sex (aOR=1.6, 95%CI: 1.1-2.3, P = 0.02). Even when controlling for condom use, men involved with group sex were more likely to be have been diagnosed with a bacterial STI in the previous year (aOR=2.1, 95%CI: 1.3-3.3, P = 0.002).Background This study explored the relationships between participation in group sex and risk for HIV and other sexually transmissible infections (STIs).An anonymous online survey collected data from 580 gay and bisexual men using a mobile sex and dating application in Paris, France. Logistic regression analyses were conducted, which controlled for HIV status, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use and participants' sociodemographic characteristics.Group sex remains a useful marker of risk among gay and bisexual men, but research is needed that moves beyond individual practice in order to assess the epidemiological networks comprising group sex and the risks they pose relevant to HIV and other STIs.","299":"Mosquito-borne diseases are a major global public health concern and mosquito surveillance systems are essential for the implementation of effective mosquito control strategies. The objective of our study is to determine the spatiotemporal distribution of vector mosquito species in Maricopa County, AZ from 2011 to 2021, and to identify the hotspot areas for West Nile virus (WNV) and St. Louis Encephalitis virus (SLEV) transmission in 2021. The Maricopa County Mosquito Control surveillance system utilizes BG-Sentinel and EVS-CDC traps throughout the entire urban and suburban areas of the county. We estimated specific mosquito species relative abundance per unit area using the Kernel density estimator in ArcGIS 10.2. We calculated the distance between all traps in the surveillance system and created a 4\u00a0km buffer radius around each trap to calculate the extent to which each trap deviated from the mean number of Culex quinquefasciatus and Culex tarsalis collected in 2021. Our results show that vector mosquito species are widely distributed and abundant in the urban areas of Maricopa County. A total of 691,170Cx. quinquefasciatus, 542,733 Cx. tarsalis, and 292,305 Aedes aegypti were collected from 2011 to 2022. The relative abundance of Ae. aegypti was highly seasonal peaking in the third and fourth quarters of the year. Culex quinquefasciatus, on the other hand, was abundant throughout the year with several regions consistently yielding high numbers of mosquitoes. Culex tarsalis was abundant but it only reached high numbers in well-defined areas near irrigated landscapes. We also detected high levels of heterogeneity in the risk of WNV and SLEV transmission to humans disregarding traps geographical proximity. The well-defined species-specific spatiotemporal and geographical patterns found in this study can be used to inform vector control operations.","300":"Populations whose mating pairs have levels of similarity in phenotypes or genotypes that differ systematically from the level expected under random mating are described as experiencing assortative mating. Excess similarity in mating pairs is termed positive assortative mating, and excess dissimilarity is negative assortative mating. In humans, empirical studies suggest that mating pairs from various admixed populations - whose ancestry derives from two or more source populations - possess correlated ancestry components that indicate the occurrence of positive assortative mating on the basis of ancestry. Generalizing a two-sex mechanistic admixture model, we devise a model of one form of ancestry-assortative mating that occurs through preferential mating based on source population. Under the model, we study the moments of the admixture fraction distribution for different assumptions about mating preferences, including both positive and negative assortative mating by population. We demonstrate that whereas the mean admixture under assortative mating is equivalent to that of a corresponding randomly mating population, the variance of admixture depends on the level and direction of assortative mating. We consider two special cases of assortative mating by population: first, a single admixture event, and second, constant contributions to the admixed population over time. In contrast to standard settings in which positive assortment increases variation within a population, certain assortative mating scenarios allow the variance of admixture to decrease relative to a corresponding randomly mating population: with the three populations we consider, the variance-increasing effect of positive assortative mating within a population might be overwhelmed by a variance-decreasing effect emerging from mating preferences involving other pairs of populations. The effect of assortative mating is smaller on the X chromosome than on the autosomes because inheritance of the X in males depends only on the mother's ancestry, not on the mating pair. Because the variance of admixture is informative about the timing of admixture and possibly about sex-biased admixture contributions, the effects of assortative mating are important to consider in inferring features of population history from distributions of admixture values. Our model provides a framework to quantitatively study assortative mating under flexible scenarios of admixture over time.","301":"In this work, first, we consider novel parameterized identities for the left and right part of the (p,q)-analogue of Hermite-Hadamard inequality. Second, using these new parameterized identities, we give new parameterized (p,q)-trapezoid and parameterized (p,q)-midpoint type integral inequalities via \u03b7-quasiconvex function. By changing values of parameter \u03bc\u2208[0,1], some new special cases from the main results are obtained and some known results are recaptured as well. Finally, at the end, an application to special means is given as well. This new research has the potential to establish new boundaries in comparative literature and some well-known implications. From an application perspective, the proposed research on the \u03b7-quasiconvex function has interesting results that illustrate the applicability and superiority of the results obtained.","302":"In this work we propose and compare multiple approaches for the formulation of boundary optimal control problems constrained by PDEs. In particular, we define a property of balanced regularity that is not satisfied by traditional approaches. In order to instead guarantee this property, we consider the use of other regularization terms, one involving fractional Sobolev norms and the other one based on the introduction of lifting functions. As required by the fractional norm approach, we present a semi-analytical numerical implementation of the fractional Laplacian operator. All the proposed formulations are also considered in conjunction with constraints of inequality type on the control variable. Numerical results are reported to compare all the presented regularization techniques.","303":"To (i) develop a methodology for using historical and comparative perspectives to inform policy and (ii) provide evidence for antimicrobial-resistance (AMR) policymaking by drawing on lessons from climate change and tobacco control.An iterative process of analysis and engagement resulted in lessons for AMR policy concerning persistent evidence gaps and uncertainty, the need for cross-sector involvement and a collective effort through global governance, the demand for new interventions through more investment in research and innovation, and recognising the dynamic relationship between social change and policy to change people's attitudes and behaviours are crucial towards tackling AMR.Using a qualitative design, we systematically examined two other complex, large-scale policy issues-climate change and tobacco control-to identify what relevance to AMR can be learned from how these issues have evolved over time. During 2018-2020, we employed a five-stage approach to conducting an exploratory study involving a review of secondary historical analysis, identification of drivers of change, prioritisation of the identified drivers, scenario generation and elicitation of possible policy responses. We sought to disrupt more 'traditional' policy and research spaces to create an alternative where, stimulated by historical analysis, academics (including historians) and policymakers could come together to challenge norms and practices and think creatively about AMR policy design.We draw on new methodological lessons around the pragmatism of future- and policy-oriented approaches incorporating robust historical and comparative analysis. The study demonstrates proof of concept and offers a reproducible method to advance further methodology, including transferrable policies that could tackle health problems, such as AMR.","304":"Three loci showed nominal POE, including the previously reported variants in KCNQ1, for type 2 diabetes in families from Botnia (rs2237895: p POE \u2009=\u20090.037), which can be considered positive controls. The strongest POE was seen for rs7578597 SNP in the THADA gene, showing excess transmission of the maternal risk allele T to diabetic offspring (Botnia: p POE \u2009=\u20090.01; HTB p POE \u2009=\u20090.045). These data are consistent with previous evidence of allelic imbalance for expression in islets, suggesting that the THADA gene can be imprinted in a POE-specific fashion. Five CpG sites, including those flanking rs7578597, showed differential methylation between diabetic and non-diabetic donor islets.Families from the Botnia study (n\u2009=\u20094,211, 1,083 families) were genotyped for 72 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with type 2 diabetes and assessed for POE on type 2 diabetes. The family-based Hungarian Transdanubian Biobank (HTB) (n\u2009=\u20091,463, >135 families) was used to replicate SNPs showing POE. Association of type 2 diabetes loci within families was also tested.Taken together, the data emphasise the need for genetic studies to consider from which parent an offspring has inherited a susceptibility allele.Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 65 genetic loci associated with risk of type 2 diabetes. However, the contribution of distorted parental transmission of alleles to risk of type 2 diabetes has been mostly unexplored. Our goal was therefore to search for parent-of-origin effects (POE) among type 2 diabetes loci in families.","305":"Despite a long history of mosquito-borne virus epidemics in the Americas, the impact of the Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic of 2015-2016 was unexpected. The need for scientifically informed decision-making is driving research to understand the emergence and spread of ZIKV. To support that research, we assembled a data set of key covariates for modeling ZIKV transmission dynamics in Colombia, where ZIKV transmission was widespread and the government made incidence data publically available. On a weekly basis between January 1, 2014 and October 1, 2016 at three administrative levels, we collated spatiotemporal Zika incidence data, nine environmental variables, and demographic data into a single downloadable database. These new datasets and those we identified, processed, and assembled at comparable spatial and temporal resolutions will save future researchers considerable time and effort in performing these data processing steps, enabling them to focus instead on extracting epidemiological insights from this important data set. Similar approaches could prove useful for filling data gaps to enable epidemiological analyses of future disease emergence events.","306":"Tickborne diseases are an increasing public health threat in the United States. Prevention and diagnosis of tickborne diseases are improved by access to current and accurate information on where medically important ticks and their associated human and veterinary pathogens are present, their local abundance or prevalence, and when ticks are actively seeking hosts. The true extent of tick and tickborne pathogen expansion is poorly defined, in part because of a lack of nationally standardized tick surveillance. We surveyed 140 vector-borne disease professionals working in state, county, and local public health and vector control agencies to assess their 1) tick surveillance program objectives, 2) pathogen testing methods, 3) tick control practices, 4) data communication strategies, and 5) barriers to program development and operation. Fewer than half of respondents reported that their jurisdiction was engaged in routine, active tick surveillance, but nearly two-thirds reported engaging in passive tick surveillance. Detection of tick presence was the most commonly stated current surveillance objective (76.2%). Most of the programs currently supporting tick pathogen testing were in the Northeast (70.8%), Upper and Central Midwest (64.3%), and the West (71.4%) regions. The most common pathogens screened for were Rickettsia spp. (Rickettsiales: Rickettsiaceae) and bacterial and viral agents transmitted by Ixodes (Acari: Ixodidae) ticks. Only 12% of respondents indicated their jurisdiction directly conducts or otherwise financially supports tick control. Responses indicated that their ability to expand the capacity of tick surveillance and control programs was impeded by inconsistent funding, limited infrastructure, guidance on best practices, and institutional capacity to perform these functions.","307":"Disasters, such as cyclones, create conditions that increase the risk of infectious disease outbreaks. Epidemic forecasts can be valuable for targeting highest risk populations before an outbreak. The two main barriers to routine use of real-time forecasts include scientific and operational challenges. First, accuracy may be limited by availability of data and the uncertainty associated with the inherently stochastic processes that determine when and where outbreaks happen and spread. Second, even if data are available, the appropriate channels of communication may prevent their use for decision making.In April 2019, only six weeks after Cyclone Idai devastated Mozambique's central region and sparked a cholera outbreak, Cyclone Kenneth severely damaged northern areas of the country. By June 10, a total of 267 cases of cholera were confirmed, sparking a vaccination campaign. Prior to Kenneth's landfall, a team of academic researchers, humanitarian responders, and health agencies developed a simple model to forecast areas at highest risk of a cholera outbreak. The model created risk indices for each district using combinations of four metrics: (1) flooding data; (2) previous annual cholera incidence; (3) sensitivity of previous outbreaks to the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation cycle; and (4) a diffusion (gravity) model to simulate movement of infected travelers. As information on cases became available, the risk model was continuously updated. A web-based tool was produced, which identified highest risk populations prior to the cyclone and the districts at-risk following the start of the outbreak.The model prior to Kenneth's arrival using the metrics of previous incidence, projected flood, and El Ni\u00f1o sensitivity accurately predicted areas at highest risk for cholera. Despite this success, not all data were available at the scale at which the vaccination campaign took place, limiting the model's utility, and the extent to which the forecasts were used remains unclear. Here, the science behind these forecasts and the organizational structure of this collaborative effort are discussed. The barriers to the routine use of forecasts in crisis settings are highlighted, as well as the potential for flexible teams to rapidly produce actionable insights for decision making using simple modeling tools, both before and during an outbreak.","308":"Embeddings of words and concepts capture syntactic and semantic regularities of language; however, they have seen limited use as tools to study characteristics of different corpora and how they relate to one another. We introduce TextEssence, an interactive system designed to enable comparative analysis of corpora using embeddings.

Due to many factors, this region has the potential to become a global hotspot for viral emergence. In Rwanda, viral diseases are underreported and the question is whether this is due to the absence of these viruses or a lack of investigation. Like many developing countries, capabilities in Rwanda need improvement despite research efforts throughout the years. This review describes the status of human and animal virus research in Rwanda and identifies relevant research and operational gaps. A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed for virus research in Rwanda: 233 primary studies on viruses\/viral diseases are indexed with connection to Rwanda. From 1958 to 2020, yearly publications generally increased and HIV\/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is the most studied virus. Compared with human viruses, few studies focus on animal and\/or zoonotic viruses. The occurrence of the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic shows strengthening warning and surveillance systems is critical to efficient preparedness and response. We recommend investment in human capacity, laboratory facilities and research to inform policy for viral surveillance in Rwanda.","310":"In our model, we found that high levels of household coverage (75% treated once per year), applied proactively before the typical dengue season could reduce symptomatic infections by 89.7% (median of 1000 simulations; interquartile range [IQR]:[83.0%, 94.8%]) in year one and 78.2% (IQR: [71.2%, 88.0%]) cumulatively over the first five years of an annual program. Lower coverage had correspondingly lower effectiveness, as did reactive campaigns. Though less effective than preventative campaigns, reactive and even post-epidemic interventions retain some effectiveness; these campaigns disrupt inter-seasonal transmission, highlighting an off-season control opportunity. Regardless, none of the campaign scenarios maintain their initial effectiveness beyond two seasons, instead stabilizing at much lower levels of benefit: in year 20, median effectiveness was only 27.3% (IQR: [-21.3%, 56.6%]). Furthermore, simply ceasing an initially successful program exposes a population with lowered herd immunity to the same historical threat, and we observed outbreaks more than four-fold larger than pre-intervention outbreaks. These results do not take into account evolving insecticide resistance, thus long-term effectiveness may be lower if new, efficacious insecticides are not developed.Using a detailed agent-based dengue transmission model for Yucat\u00e1n State, Mexico, we predict that high coverage indoor residual spraying (IRS) interventions can largely eliminate transmission for a few years, when applied a few months before the typical seasonal epidemic peak. However, vector control succeeds by preventing infections, which precludes natural immunization. Thus, as a population benefits from mosquito control, it gradually loses naturally acquired herd immunity, and the control effectiveness declines; this occurs across all of our modeled scenarios, and is consistent with other empirical work. Long term control that maintains early effectiveness would require some combination of increasing investment, complementary interventions such as vaccination, and control programs across a broad region to diminish risk of importation.Historically, mosquito control programs successfully helped contain malaria and yellow fever, but recent efforts have been unable to halt the spread of dengue, chikungunya, or Zika, all transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Using a dengue transmission model and results from indoor residual spraying (IRS) field experiments, we investigated how IRS-like campaign scenarios could effectively control dengue in an endemic setting.","311":" population dynamics, proving its suitability for future studies, also within an epidemiological framework.","312":"High sodium intake has been linked to negative health effects, including cardiovascular and renal diseases. Traditional dietary sodium assessment methods are time-consuming and subjected to errors. Using technology may increase the efficiency and accuracy of dietary assessment. The objective of this study is to develop and validate a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) screener using software to assess sodium intake among the Palestinian population.Using the FFQ screener software was a valid and reliable method for assessing dietary sodium intake. Using the photo-based method to estimate portion size improved precision and accuracy in diet assessment.The developed FFQ screener sodium screener included 41 food items categorized into nine groups, with photo-based portion size estimation and frequency of consumption. The reliability test showed a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.7, p\u2009<\u20090.01 using test and retest. For criterion validity, the correlation coefficient between dietary sodium intake using the FFQ screener software and the 24-hour urine sodium test was (0.6, p\u2009<\u20090.000). The correlation coefficient between dietary sodium intake using the FFQ screener software and dietary sodium intake using a 3-day recall was (0.3, p\u2009<\u20090.000). Sodium intake was significantly correlated with preferences for low-sodium food and previous salt reduction, p\u2009<\u20090.05.The study was conducted in four phases. In Phase 1, Palestinian foods were categorized and subcategorized according to their mode of consumption, sodium content, and food groups. The sodium content values were calculated from Palestinian food composition database. Content validity was done in Phase 2, while in Phase 3, a pilot study was conducted to determine test-retest reliability. In Phase 4, the criterion validity of the screener was assessed by comparing the results of sodium intake from the FFQ screener with the results from a 24-hour urinary sodium test and a 3-day diet recall. Correlations between the sodium intake values from the three methods were analyzed using Pearson correlation tests, and the difference was assessed using the Bland-Altman test.","313":"We assessed predicted vitamin D score in relation to CRC among 49,534 participants in the Black Women's Health Study, a cohort of African American women followed from 1995 to 2017 through biennial questionnaires. We derived predicted vitamin D scores at each questionnaire cycle for all participants using a previously validated prediction model based on actual 25-hydroxyvitamin D values from a subset of participants. We calculated cumulative average predicted vitamin D score at every cycle by averaging scores from cycles up to and including that cycle. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for CRC incidence according to predicted score quartiles.Our findings, taken together with established evidence that vitamin D levels are generally lower in African Americans than other U.S. groups, suggest that low vitamin D status may contribute to the disproportionately high CRC incidence among African Americans.Observational studies, mostly among White populations, suggest that low vitamin D levels increase colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. African Americans, who are disproportionately burdened by CRC, often have lower vitamin D levels compared to other populations.Low vitamin D status may lead to elevated CRC risk in African American women.Over follow-up, 488 incident CRC occurred. Compared to women in the highest quartile of predicted vitamin D score, those in the lowest had an estimated 41% (HR=1.41, 95% CI 1.05-1.90) higher CRC risk. Comparable HRs were 1.44 (95% CI 1.02-2.01) for colon and 1.34 (95% CI 0.70-2.56) for rectal cancer.","314":"These findings were consistent across each of the SIGHT Studies, which are located in three geographically distinct US locations in rural Alabama, small urban locations in Michigan, and urban New York City.To describe the neighborhood-level social risk factors across the three SIGHT Study sites and assess potential characteristics of these populations to help other researchers effectively design and implement targeted glaucoma community-based screening and follow-up programs in high-risk groups.In 2019, Columbia University, University of Michigan, and University of Alabama at Birmingham each received 5 years of CDC funding to test a wide spectrum of targeted telehealth delivery methods to detect glaucoma in community-based health delivery settings among high-risk populations. This collaborative initiative supported innovative strategies to better engage populations most at risk and least likely to have access to eye care to detect and manage glaucoma and other eye diseases in community-based settings. Among the initial 2,379 participants enrolled in all three site SIGHT Studies; 27% screened positive for glaucoma\/glaucoma suspect. Of all SIGHT Study participants, 91% were 40 years of age and older, 64% identified as female, 60% identified as African-American, 32% identified as White, 19% identified as Hispanic\/Latino, 53% had a high school education or less, 15% had no health insurance, and 38% had Medicaid insurance. Targeted glaucoma screenings in populations with high levels of poverty and high proportions of people who identify as African American, Hispanic\/Latino identified a 27% rate of glaucoma and suspected glaucoma, three times the national average.","315":"Connecticut (CT) implemented mandatory reporting of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2\/3 and adenocarcinoma in situ (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher [CIN2+]) in 2008. Trends by age and birth cohort were modeled using negative binomial regression and change-point methods. To evaluate possible explanations for changes, these trends were compared to changes in HPV vaccination coverage, cervical cancer screening, an antecedent event to detection of a high-grade lesion, and changes in sexual behaviors and Chlamydia trachomatis, an infection with similar epidemiology to and shared risk factors for HPV.A significant decline in CIN2+ was first evident among women aged 21 years in 2010, followed by successive declines in women aged 22-26 years during 2011-2012. During 2008-2015, the rates of CIN2+ declined by 30%-74% among women aged 21-26 years, with greater declines observed in the younger women. Birth cohorts between 1985 and 1994 all experienced significant declines during the surveillance period, ranging from 25% to 82%. Ecological comparisons revealed substantial increases in HPV vaccination during this time period, and more modest reductions in cervical cancer screening and sexual risk behaviors.Trends in human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical lesions can provide an indication of vaccine impact. Our purpose was to measure trends in cervical lesions during 2008-2015 and to consider possible explanations including vaccination coverage, changes in screening for cervical cancer, and risk behaviors for acquiring HPV.The age and cohort patterns in our data suggest that declines in CIN2+ during 2008-2015 are more likely driven by HPV vaccination, introduced in 2006, than by changes in screening or risk behavior.","316":"Genus Flavivirus, which includes 53 virus species, is the leading cause of arthropod-borne diseases in humans. Diagnosis of these viral diseases is complicated by their overlapping epidemiology and clinical manifestations, and the fact that cross-reactive antibody responses are frequently elicited by individuals in response to infection. We developed a bead-based immunoassay to concomitantly profile the isotype and subclass of antibody responses (five isotypes and four subclasses) in parallel with specificity against multiple antigens. Our panel included 22 envelope (E) and non-structural 1 (NS1) proteins of different flaviviruses (Zika (ZIKV), Dengue (DENV), Yellow Fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV), Japanese Encephalitis (JEV) and Tick-Borne Encephalitis (TBEV)) and the envelope protein of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Using 54 samples from 40 individuals with ZIKV infection that had been pre-characterized, we identified 1) stronger ZIKV responses in individuals previously exposed to flavivirus compared to flavivirus-na\u00efve individuals; 2) different antibody isotypes depending on the stage of infection: acute, convalescent and late convalescent; 3) cross-reactive responses; and 4) a potential CHIKV infection. The assay had a broad dynamic range (>5 logs) and has the potential to distinguish antigen-specific responses induced by ZIKV infection from cross-reactive responses. The multidimensional data provided by this high-throughput antibody-profiling platform can advance our understanding of the human immune response to flaviviruses as they expand their global reach.","317":"The International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR)'s \"Good Practices Task Force\" reports are highly cited, multistakeholder perspective expert guidance reports that reflect international standards for health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) and their use in healthcare decision making. In this report, we discuss the criteria, development, and evaluation\/consensus review and approval process for initiating a task force. The rationale for a task force must include a justification, including why this good practice guidance is important and its potential impact on the scientific community. The criteria include: (1) necessity (why is this task force required?); (2) a methodology-oriented focus (focus on research methods, approaches, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination); (3) relevance (to ISPOR's mission and its members); (4) durability over time; (5) broad applicability; and 6) an evidence-based approach. In addition, the proposal must be a priority specifically for ISPOR. These reports are valuable to researchers, academics, students, health technology assessors, medical technology developers and service providers, those working in other commercial entities, regulators, and payers. These stakeholder perspectives are represented in task force membership to ensure the report's overall usefulness and relevance to the global ISPOR membership. We hope that this discussion will bring transparency to the process of initiating, approving, and producing these task force reports and encourage participation from a diverse range of experts within and outside ISPOR.","318":"HPV vaccine introduction appears to be economically attractive only if Vietnam is able to procure the vaccine at Gavi prices. This highlights the importance of initiating a nationwide vaccination programme while such prices are still available.Cervical cancer is currently the leading cause of cancer mortality among women in South Vietnam and the second leading cause of cancer mortality in North Vietnam. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has the potential to substantially decrease this burden. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that a cost-effectiveness analysis of HPV vaccination is conducted before nationwide introduction.The cost of cervical cancer treatment ranged from US$368 - 11400 depending on the type of hospital and treatment involved. Under Gavi-negotiated prices of US$4.55, HPV vaccination is likely to be very cost-effective with an incremental cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted in the range US$780 - 1120. However, under list prices for Cervarix and Gardasil in Vietnam, the incremental cost per DALY averted for HPV vaccination can exceed US$8000.The Papillomavirus Rapid Interface for Modeling and Economics (PRIME) model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccine introduction. A costing study based on expert panel discussions, interviews and hospital case note reviews was conducted to explore the cost of cervical cancer care.","319":"A positive MRSA test result, presumed to indicate contact precautions use according to the VA MRSA Prevention Initiative.The effectiveness and importance of contact precautions for endemic pathogens has long been debated, and their use has broad implications for infection control of other pathogens.In this cohort study of adults in VA hospitals, transmissibility of MRSA was found to be reduced by approximately 50% among patients with contact precautions. These results provide an explanation for decreasing acquisition rates in VA hospitals since the MRSA Prevention Initiative.In this cohort study of 108 VA hospitals, more than 2 million unique individuals had over 5.6 million admissions, of which 14.1% were presumed to have contact precautions with more than 8.4 million MRSA surveillance tests. Pooled estimates found associations between contact precautions and transmission to be stable from 2008 to 2017, with estimated transmission reductions ranging from 43% (95% credible interval [CrI], 38%-48%) to 51% (95% CrI, 46%-55%). Over the entire 10-year study period, contact precautions reduced transmission 47% (95% CrI, 45%-49%), and the intrafacility autocorrelation coefficient estimate was 0.99, suggesting consistent estimates over time within facilities. Larger facilities and those with higher admission screening compliance observed additional reductions in transmission associated with contact precautions (relative rate, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74-0.96 and 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58-0.96, respectively) compared with smaller facilities and those with lower admission screening compliance. Facilities in the southern US had a smaller transmission reduction attributable to contact precautions (relative rate, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01-1.28) compared with facilities in other regions in the US.To estimate the association between contact precautions and transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) across US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals.This retrospective cohort study used mathematical models applied to data from a population-based sample of adults hospitalized in 108 VA acute care hospitals for at least 24 hours from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2017. Data were analyzed from May 2, 2019, to December 11, 2020.The main outcome was the association between contact precautions and MRSA transmission, defined as the relative transmissibility attributed to contact precautions. A contact precaution effect estimate (<1 indicates a reduction in transmission associated with contact precautions) was estimated for each hospital and then pooled over time and across hospitals using meta-regression.","320":"Rates of Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) completion remain low in programmatic settings in sub-Saharan Africa. Differentiated HIV care models may improve IPT completion by addressing joint barriers to IPT and HIV treatment. However, the impact of differentiated care on IPT completion remains unknown. In a cross-sectional study of people with HIV on antiretroviral therapy in 5 communities in rural Uganda, we compared IPT completion between patients receiving HIV care via a differentiated care model versus a standard HIV care model and assessed multi-level predictors of IPT completion. A total of 103\/144 (72%) patients received differentiated care and 85\/161 (53%) received standard care completed IPT (p < 0.01). Adjusting for age, gender and community, patients receiving differentiated care had higher odds of completing IPT (aOR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.5-4.5, p < 0.01). Predictors of IPT completion varied by the care model, and differentiated care modified the positive association between treatment completion and the belief in the efficacy of IPT and the negative association with side-effects. Patients receiving a multi-component differentiated care model had a higher odds of IPT completion than standard care, and the model's impact on health beliefs, social support, and perceived side effects to IPT may underlie this positive association.","321":"Few studies of breast cancer treatment have focused on the Northern Plains of the United States, an area with a high mastectomy rate. This study examined the association between geographic access to radiation therapy facilities and receipt of breast cancer treatments among early-stage breast cancer patients in South Dakota. Based on 4,209 early-stage breast cancer patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2012 in South Dakota, the study measured geographic proximity to radiation therapy facilities using the shortest travel time for patients to the closest radiation therapy facility. Two-level logistic regression models were used to estimate for early stage cases i) the odds of mastectomy versus breast conserving surgery (BCS); ii) the odds of not receiving radiation therapy after BCS versus receiving follow-up radiation therapy. Covariates included race\/ethnicity, age at diagnosis, tumour grade, tumour sequence, year of diagnosis, census tract-level poverty rate and urban\/rural residence. The spatial scan statistic method was used to identify geographic areas with significantly higher likelihood of experiencing mastectomy. The study found that geographic accessibility to radiation therapy facilities was negatively associated with the likelihood of receiving mastectomy after adjustment for other covariates, but not associated with radiation therapy use among patients receiving BCS. Compared with patients travelling less than 30 minutes to a radiation therapy facility, patients travelling more than 90 minutes were about 1.5 times more likely to receive mastectomy (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.11) and patients travelling more than 120 minutes were 1.7 times more likely to receive mastectomy (odds ratio, 1.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-2.42). The study also identified a statistically significant cluster of patients receiving mastectomy who were located in south-eastern South Dakota, after adjustment for other factors. Because geographic proximity to treatment facilities plays an important role on the treatment for early-stage breast cancer patients, this study has important implications for developing targeted intervention to reduce disparities in breast cancer treatment in South Dakota.","322":"Increasing evidence suggests a key role for tissue energy failure in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS). Studies in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a commonly used model of MS, have been instrumental in illuminating the mechanisms that may be involved in compromising energy production. In this article, we review recent advances in EAE research focussing on factors that conspire to impair tissue energy metabolism, such as tissue hypoxia, mitochondrial dysfunction, production of reactive oxygen\/nitrogen species, and sodium dysregulation, which are directly affected by energy insufficiency, and promote cellular damage. A greater understanding of how inflammation affects tissue energy balance may lead to novel and effective therapeutic strategies that ultimately will benefit not only people affected by MS but also people affected by the wide range of other neurological disorders in which neuroinflammation plays an important role.","323":"In this systematic review, meta-analysis, and modelling study, we searched PubMed, Ovid, and Web of Science for articles published from database inception until Sept 26, 2022, for prospective and retrospective cross-sectional studies that addressed serological chikungunya virus infection in any geographical region, age group, and population subgroup and for longitudinal prospective and retrospective cohort studies with data on chronic chikungunya or hospital admissions in people with chikungunya. We did a systematic review of studies on chikungunya seroprevalence and fitted catalytic models to each survey to estimate location-specific FOI (ie, the rate at which susceptible individuals acquire chikungunya infection). We performed a meta-analysis to estimate the proportion of symptomatic patients with laboratory-confirmed chikungunya who had chronic chikungunya or were admitted to hospital following infection. We used a random-effects model to assess the relationship between chronic sequelae and follow-up length using linear regression. The systematic review protocol is registered online on PROSPERO, CRD42022363102.Chikungunya is an arboviral disease transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes with a growing global burden linked to climate change and globalisation. We aimed to estimate chikungunya seroprevalence, force of infection (FOI), and prevalence of related chronic disability and hospital admissions in endemic and epidemic settings.We inferred subnational heterogeneity in long-term average annual FOI and transmission dynamics and identified both endemic and epidemic settings across different countries. Brazil, Ethiopia, Malaysia, and India included both endemic and epidemic settings. Long-term average annual FOI was higher in epidemic settings than endemic settings. However, long-term cumulative incidence of chikungunya can be similar between large outbreaks in epidemic settings with a high FOI and endemic settings with a relatively low FOI.International Vaccine Institute.We identified 60 studies with data on seroprevalence and chronic chikungunya symptoms done across 76 locations in 38 countries, and classified 17 (22%) of 76 locations as endemic settings and 59 (78%) as epidemic settings. The global long-term median annual FOI was 0\u00b7007 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 0\u00b7003-0\u00b7010) and varied from 0\u00b70001 (0\u00b700004-0\u00b70002) to 0\u00b7113 (0\u00b707-0\u00b720). The highest estimated median seroprevalence at age 10 years was in south Asia (8\u00b70% [95% UI 6\u00b75-9\u00b76]), followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (7\u00b78% [4\u00b79-14\u00b76]), whereas median seroprevalence was lowest in the Middle East (1\u00b70% [0\u00b75-1\u00b79]). We estimated that 51% (95% CI 45-58) of people with laboratory-confirmed symptomatic chikungunya had chronic disability after infection and 4% (3-5) were admitted to hospital following infection.","324":" Disparities were defined as difference of \u22655% between the proportion of cases and the proportion of the population or a ratio \u22651.5 for the proportion of cases to the proportion of the population for underrepresented racial\/ethnic groups in each county. During June 5-18, 205 counties in 33 states were identified as hotspots; among these counties, race was reported for \u226550% of cumulative cases in 79 (38.5%) counties in 22 states; 96.2% of these counties had disparities in COVID-19 cases in one or more underrepresented racial\/ethnic groups. Hispanic\/Latino (Hispanic) persons were the largest group by population size (3.5 million persons) living in hotspot counties where a disproportionate number of cases among that group was identified, followed by black\/African American (black) persons (2 million), American Indian\/Alaska Native (AI\/AN) persons (61,000), Asian persons (36,000), and Native Hawaiian\/other Pacific Islander (NHPI) persons (31,000). Examining county-level data disaggregated by race\/ethnicity can help identify health disparities in COVID-19 cases and inform strategies for preventing and slowing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. More complete race\/ethnicity data are needed to fully inform public health decision-making. Addressing the pandemic's disproportionate incidence of COVID-19 in communities of color can reduce the community-wide impact of COVID-19 and improve health outcomes.","325":"Assessing the effects of early nonpharmaceutical interventions on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread is crucial for understanding and planning future control measures to combat the pandemic. We use observations of reported infections and deaths, human mobility data, and a metapopulation transmission model to quantify changes in disease transmission rates in U.S. counties from 15 March to 3 May 2020. We find that marked, asynchronous reductions of the basic reproductive number occurred throughout the United States in association with social distancing and other control measures. Counterfactual simulations indicate that, had these same measures been implemented 1 to 2 weeks earlier, substantial cases and deaths could have been averted and that delayed responses to future increased incidence will facilitate a stronger rebound of infections and death. Our findings underscore the importance of early intervention and aggressive control in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic.","326":"We used an agent-based model to simulate the viral load dynamics of exposed contacts, and their potential for onward transmission in different quarantine and testing strategies. We compared the performance of quarantines of differing durations, testing with either PCR or lateral flow antigen (LFA) tests at the end of quarantine, and daily LFA testing without quarantine, against the current 14-day quarantine strategy. We also investigated the effect of contact tracing delays and adherence to both quarantine and self-isolation on the effectiveness of each strategy.National Institute for Health Research, UK Research and Innovation, Wellcome Trust, EU Horizon 2021, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.In most countries, contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases are asked to quarantine for 14 days after exposure to limit asymptomatic onward transmission. While theoretically effective, this policy places a substantial social and economic burden on both the individual and wider society, which might result in low adherence and reduced policy effectiveness. We aimed to assess the merit of testing contacts to avert onward transmission and to replace or reduce the length of quarantine for uninfected contacts.Assuming moderate levels of adherence to quarantine and self-isolation, self-isolation on symptom onset alone can prevent 37% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 12-56) of onward transmission potential from secondary cases. 14 days of post-exposure quarantine reduces transmission by 59% (95% UI 28-79). Quarantine with release after a negative PCR test 7 days after exposure might avert a similar proportion (54%, 95% UI 31-81; risk ratio [RR] 0\u00b794, 95% UI 0\u00b762-1\u00b724) to that of the 14-day quarantine period, as would quarantine with a negative LFA test 7 days after exposure (50%, 95% UI 28-77; RR 0\u00b788, 0\u00b766-1\u00b711) or daily testing without quarantine for 5 days after tracing (50%, 95% UI 23-81; RR 0\u00b788, 0\u00b760-1\u00b743) if all tests are returned negative. A stronger effect might be possible if individuals isolate more strictly after a positive test and if contacts can be notified faster.Testing might allow for a substantial reduction in the length of, or replacement of, quarantine with a small excess in transmission risk. Decreasing test and trace delays and increasing adherence will further increase the effectiveness of these strategies. Further research is required to empirically evaluate the potential costs (increased transmission risk, false reassurance) and benefits (reduction in the burden of quarantine, increased adherence) of such strategies before adoption as policy.","327":" (World Health Organization water quality risk thresholds), additional packaging decontamination suggest no marginal benefit in risk reduction. Consequences of this decontamination may include increased chemical exposures to workers, food quality and hazard risks to consumers, and unnecessary added costs to governments and the global food industry.","328":"Growing numbers of artificial intelligence applications are being developed and applied to pathology and laboratory medicine. These technologies introduce risks and benefits that must be assessed and managed through the lens of ethics. This article describes how long-standing principles of medical and scientific ethics can be applied to artificial intelligence using examples from pathology and laboratory medicine.","329":"This study highlights the importance of public trust in government and its institutions during public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results are relevant and help understand why governments need to address the risks of non-compliance among low trusting individuals to achieve the success of the containment policies.To examine how public trust mediates the people's adherence to levels of stringent government health policies and to establish if these effects vary across the political regimes.This study utilizes data from two large-scale surveys: the global behaviors and perceptions at the onset of COVID-19 pandemic and the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT). Linear regression models were used to estimate the effects of public trust and strictness of restriction measures on people's compliance level. The model accounted for individual and daily variations in country-level stringency of preventative measures. Differences in the dynamics between public trust, the stringent level of government health guidelines and policy compliance were also examined among countries based on political regimes.We find strong evidence of the increase in compliance due to the imposition of stricter government restrictions. The examination of heterogeneous effects suggests that high public trust in government and the perception of its truthfulness double the impact of policy restrictions on public compliance. Among political regimes, higher levels of public trust significantly increase the predicted compliance as stringency level rises in authoritarian and democratic countries.","330":"Parental refusal and delay of childhood vaccination has increased in recent years in the United States. This phenomenon challenges maintenance of herd immunity and increases the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. We examine US county-level vaccine refusal for patients under five years of age collected during the period 2012-2015 from an administrative healthcare dataset. We model these data with a Bayesian zero-inflated negative binomial regression model to capture social and political processes that are associated with vaccine refusal, as well as factors that affect our measurement of vaccine refusal. Our work highlights fine-scale socio-demographic characteristics associated with vaccine refusal nationally, finds that spatial clustering in refusal can be explained by such factors, and has the potential to aid in the development of targeted public health strategies for optimizing vaccine uptake.","331":"For COVAIL recipients of a COVID-19 Sanofi booster vaccine, neutralizing antibody titers were assessed as a correlate of risk (CoR) of COVID-19. Peak and exposure-proximal titers were inverse CoRs with covariate-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) 0.30 (0.11, 0.78) and 0.25 (0.07, 0.85) per 10-fold increase in weighted average titer.","332":"Habitat construction and phenotypic plasticity are alternative responses to variable environments. We explored evolution along an environmental gradient of habitat construction alone and in combination with phenotypic plasticity using individual-based simulations that manipulated the fitness benefit of construction and whether construction maintained or eliminated that gradient. Construction was favored when its benefits were more likely to flow to the immediate offspring of the constructing individuals. Habitat construction and phenotypic plasticity traded off against each other or plasticity was selected against, depending on how the optimum environment varied and with the fitness value of construction. When selection favored differences in the amount of construction along the environmental gradient, genetic differentiation for habitat construction increased as the fitness value of construction increased. The degree to which each adaptive response was likely to evolve also depended on the precise ordering of life history events. Adaptive habitat construction does not always occur and may be selected against. This article is protected by copyright.

The Ethiopian National Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) and the Global Vaccine Action Plan set coverage goals of 90% at national level and 80% at district level by 2020. This study analyses full vaccination coverage among children in Ethiopia and estimates the equity impact by socioeconomic, geographic, maternal and child characteristics based on the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey dataset.Vaccination coverage in Ethiopia has a pro-advantaged regressive distribution with respect to both household wealth and maternal education. Children from poorer households, rural regions of Afar and Somali, no maternal education, and female-headed households had lower full vaccination coverage. Targeted programmes to reach under-immunised children in these subpopulations will improve vaccination coverage and equity outcomes in Ethiopia.Full vaccination coverage was 33.3% [29.4-37.2] in 2016. Single vaccination coverage ranged from 49.1% [45.1-53.1] for PCV3 to 69.2% [65.5-72.8] for BCG. Wealth and maternal education related inequities were pronounced with concentration indices of 0.30 and 0.23 respectively. Children in Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa were seven times more likely to have full vaccination compared to children living in the Afar region. Children in female-headed households were 49% less likely to have full vaccination.Full vaccination coverage (1-dose BCG, 3-dose DTP3-HepB-Hib, 3-dose polio, 1-dose measles (MCV1), 3-dose pneumococcal (PCV3), and 2-dose rotavirus vaccines) of 2,004 children aged 12-23\u00a0months was analysed. Mean coverage was disaggregated by socioeconomic (household wealth, religion, ethnicity), geographic (area of residence, region), maternal (maternal age at birth, maternal education, maternal marital status, sex of household head), and child (sex of child, birth order) characteristics. Concentration indices estimated wealth and education-related inequities, and multiple logistic regression assessed associations between full vaccination coverage and socioeconomic, geographic, maternal, and child characteristics.","334":"County-level estimates of 14 indicators associated with COVID-19 mortality were extracted from public data sources. Effect estimates of the individual indicators were calculated with univariate models. Presence of spatial autocorrelation was established using Moran's I statistic. Spatial simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models that account for spatial autocorrelation in response and predictors were used to assess (i) the proportion of variance in county-level COVID-19 mortality that can explained by identified health\/socioeconomic indicators (R2); and (ii) effect estimates of each predictor. Adjusting for case rates, the selected indicators individually explain 24%-29% of the variability in mortality. Prevalence of chronic kidney disease and proportion of population residing in nursing homes have the highest R2. Mortality is estimated to increase by 43 per thousand residents (95% CI: 37-49; p < 0.001) with a 1% increase in the prevalence of chronic kidney disease and by 39 deaths per thousand (95% CI: 34-44; p < 0.001) with 1% increase in population living in nursing homes. SAR models using multiple health\/socioeconomic indicators explain 43% of the variability in COVID-19 mortality in US counties, adjusting for case rates. R2 was found to be not sensitive to the choice of SAR model form. Study limitations include the use of mortality rates that are not age standardized, a spatial adjacency matrix that does not capture human flows among counties, and insufficient accounting for interaction among predictors.With the availability of multiple Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines and the predicted shortages in supply for the near future, it is necessary to allocate vaccines in a manner that minimizes severe outcomes, particularly deaths. To date, vaccination strategies in the United States have focused on individual characteristics such as age and occupation. Here, we assess the utility of population-level health and socioeconomic indicators as additional criteria for geographical allocation of vaccines.Significant spatial autocorrelation exists in COVID-19 mortality in the US, and population health\/socioeconomic indicators account for a considerable variability in county-level mortality. In the context of vaccine rollout in the US and globally, national and subnational estimates of burden of disease could inform optimal geographical allocation of vaccines.","335":"The percent of adequate ICBPs significantly increased with the intervention from 61% pre-intervention to 74% post-intervention (adjusted odds ratio of 1.87, p value\u2009=\u20090.023). The median length of stay decreased by approximately 25%, from 4\u00a0days pre-intervention to 3\u00a0days post-intervention (p value \u2009=\u20090.11).Inpatient colonoscopy bowel preparation (ICBP) is frequently inadequate and can lead to adverse events, delayed or repeated procedures, and negative patient outcomes. Guidelines to overcome the complex factors in this setting are not well established. Our aims were to use health systems engineering principles to comprehensively evaluate the ICBP process, create an ICBP protocol, increase adequate ICBP, and decrease length of stay. Our goal was to provide adaptable tools for other institutions and procedural specialties.Patients admitted to our tertiary care academic hospital that underwent inpatient colonoscopy between July 3, 2017 to June 8, 2018 were included. Our multi-disciplinary team created a protocol employing health systems engineering techniques (i.e., process mapping, cause-effect diagrams, and plan-do-study-act cycles). We collected demographic and colonoscopy data. Our outcome measures were adequate preparation and length of stay. We compared pre-intervention (120 ICBP) vs. post-intervention (129 ICBP) outcomes using generalized linear regression models. Our new ICBP protocol included: split-dose 6-L polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution, a gastroenterology electronic note template, and an education plan for patients, nurses, and physicians.By addressing issues at patient, provider, and system levels with health systems engineering principles, we addressed patient safety and quality of care provided by improving rates of adequate ICBP.","336":"We used two large existing data sets that included speech samples from children between the ages of 2.5 and 8 years. One data set included 511 longitudinal speech samples from children with CP; the other included 505 cross-sectional speech samples from TD children. We examined receiver operating characteristic curves and sensitivity\/specificity results by age for differentiating among groups of children.TD children versus those with CP and NSMI showed differentiation in their speech intelligibility across all ages, but the strength of differentiation was only marginally above chance. Children with CP and NSMI showed clear differentiation in their speech intelligibility from those with CP and SMI beginning at the earliest age point. Children with CP who have intelligibility below 40% at the age of 3 years have a very high probability of having SMI.Early intelligibility screening should be performed in children diagnosed with CP. Those with intelligibility below 40% at 3 years of age should be referred immediately for speech assessment and treatment.Early identification of speech motor involvement (SMI) in children with cerebral palsy (CP) is difficult because of overlapping features with many aspects of typical speech development. Quantitative measures of speech intelligibility have the potential to differentiate between children with SMI and those with no SMI (NSMI). We examined thresholds for speech intelligibility development in children with CP relative to the low end of age-specific typical developmental expectations. We sought to determine whether there were intelligibility differences between children with CP and NSMI versus typically developing (TD) age-mates across the range of development and whether there were differences between children with CP who have NSMI and those with CP who have SMI across the range of development based on speech intelligibility.","337":"Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling for nanoparticles elucidates the nanoparticle drug's disposition in the body and serves a vital role in drug development and clinical studies. This paper offers a systematic and tutorial-like approach to developing a model structure and writing distribution ordinary differential equations based on asking binary questions involving the physico-chemical nature of the drug in question. Further, by synthesizing existing knowledge, we summarize pertinent aspects in PBPK modeling and create a guide for building model structure and distribution equations, optimizing nanoparticle and non-nanoparticle specific parameters, performing sensitivity analysis and model validation. The purpose of this paper is to facilitate a streamlined model development process for students and practitioners in the field.","338":"When a new vaccine is introduced, it is critical to monitor trends in disease rates to ensure that the vaccine is effective and to quantify its impact. However, estimates from observational studies can be confounded by unrelated changes in healthcare utilization, changes in the underlying health of the population, or changes in reporting. Other diseases are often used to detect and adjust for these changes, but choosing an appropriate control disease a priori is a major challenge. The \"synthetic controls\" (causal impact) method, which was originally developed for website analytics and social sciences, provides an appealing solution. With this approach, potential comparison time series are combined into a composite and are used to generate a counterfactual estimate, which can be compared with the time series of interest after the intervention. We sought to estimate changes in hospitalizations for all-cause pneumonia associated with the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) in five countries in the Americas. Using synthetic controls, we found a substantial decline in hospitalizations for all-cause pneumonia in infants in all five countries (average of 20%), whereas estimates for young and middle-aged adults varied by country and were potentially influenced by the 2009 influenza pandemic. In contrast to previous reports, we did not detect a decline in all-cause pneumonia in older adults in any country. Synthetic controls promise to increase the accuracy of studies of vaccine impact and to increase comparability of results between populations compared with alternative approaches.","339":"We estimated the average number of discounted lifetime QALYs lost per infection as 0.09 [0.03-0.19 95% uncertainty interval (UI)]. The total expected number of QALYs lost due to syphilis acquired in 2018 was 13,349[5,071-31,360]. While per-case loss was the lowest among MSM(0.06), MSM accounted for 47.7% of the overall burden. For each case of congenital syphilis, we estimated 1.79[1.43-2.16] and 0.06[0.01-0.14] QALYs lost in the child and the mother, respectively. We projected 2,332[1,871-2,825] and 79[17-177] QALYs lost for children and mothers, respectively, due to congenital syphilis in 2018.We developed a Markov model which simulates the natural history and management of syphilis. The model was parameterized by sex and sexual orientation (women who have sex with men, men who have sex with women[MSW], and men who have sex with men[MSM]), and by age at primary infection. We developed a separate decision tree model to quantify health losses due to congenital syphilis. We estimated the average lifetime number of QALYs lost per infection, and the total expected lifetime number of QALYs lost due to syphilis acquired in 2018.The purpose of this study was to estimate the health impact of syphilis in the United States in terms of the number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost attributable to infections in 2018.Syphilis causes substantial health losses in adults and children. Quantifying these health losses in terms of QALYs can inform cost-effectiveness analyses and can facilitate comparisons of the burden of syphilis to that of other diseases.","340":"We analyzed published HIV-1 group M capsid sequences from 21,012 capsid-inhibitor na\u00efve individuals to characterize amino acid variability at each position and influence of subtype and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) selection pressure. We determined the distributions of usual mutations, defined as amino acid differences from the group M consensus, with a prevalence \u2265 0.1%. Co-evolving mutations were identified using a phylogenetically-informed Bayesian graphical model method.162 (70.1%) positions had no usual mutations (45.9%) or only conservative usual mutations with a positive BLOSUM62 score (24.2%). Variability correlated independently with subtype-specific amino acid occurrence (Spearman rho = 0.83; p < 1 \u00d7 10-9) and the number of times positions were reported to contain an HLA-associated polymorphism, an indicator of CTL pressure (rho = 0.43; p = 0.0002).Knowing the distribution of usual capsid mutations is essential for sequence quality control. Comparing capsid sequences from lenacapavir-treated and lenacapavir-na\u00efve individuals will enable the identification of additional mutations potentially associated with lenacapavir therapy.With the approval of the HIV-1 capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir, capsid sequencing will be required for managing lenacapavir-experienced individuals with detectable viremia. Successful sequence interpretation will require examining new capsid sequences in the context of previously published sequence data.","341":"We evaluated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization in the test-negative HAIVEN study. Nasal-throat swabs were tested by RT-PCR for influenza and VE was determined based on odds of vaccination by generalized estimating equations. Vaccine-specific antibody was measured in a subset of enrollees.The 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 influenza seasons were notable for high number of hospitalizations for influenza A(H3N2) despite vaccine and circulating strain match.Low VE for the A\/Hong Kong\/4801\/2014 vaccine virus in both A(H3N2) seasons emphasizes concerns for continued changes in H3N2 antigenic epitopes, including changes that may impact glycosylation and ultimately reduce VE.A total of 6,129 adults were enrolled from ten hospitals. Adjusted VE against A(H3N2) was 22.8% (95% C.I. 8.3%, 35.0%), pooled across both years and 49.4% (95% C.I. 34.3%, 61.1%) against B\/Yamagata. In 2017-2018, the A(H3N2) VE point estimate for the cell-based vaccine was 43.0% (95% C.I. -36.3%, 76.1%; 56 vaccine recipients) compared to 24.0% (95% C.I. 3.9%, 39.9%) for egg based vaccines. Among 643 with serology data, hemagglutinin antibodies against the egg-based A(H3N2) vaccine strain were increased in influenza-negative individuals.","342":"- Patients admitted to a room that was previously occupied by a patient with CDI had a 27% increased odds of subsequently being diagnosed with CDI (odds ratio (OR)=1.269; 95% confidence interval (CI)= 1.12-1.44) if exposed within the last 90 days and 40% increased odds (OR=1.401; 95% CI= 1.25-1.57) if exposed in the last 365 days after controlling for previous admissions and length of stay. Cumulative patient-day exposure to previously CDI-positive occupied rooms within both 90 and 365 days were also found to be independently significant, with a 4.5% (OR 1.045; 95% CI\u202f=\u202f1.03-1.06) and 4.2% (OR 1.042; 95% CI\u202f=\u202f1.03-1.06) increase in odds of CDI with each day of exposure respectively.- This is a non-concurrent cohort study of adult inpatients admitted to five hospitals. Exposed rooms were identified as being occupied by a patient diagnosed with CDI and a logistic regression was performed to assess if staying in an exposed room increases the risk of CDI in subsequent patients.-Previous single-center studies suggest that exposure to a room previously occupied by a patient with CDI may increase the risk of CDI in subsequent patients. We evaluated the risk of previous room occupant on CDI risk across 5 adult hospitals.This study adds further evidence that hospital environment in patient rooms may contribute to risk for CDI.","343":"One prominent feature of human culture is that different populations have different tools, technologies and cultural artefacts, and these unique toolkits can also differ in size and complexity. Over the past few decades, researchers in the fields of prehistoric demography and cultural evolution have addressed a number of questions regarding variation in toolkit size and complexity across prehistoric and modern populations. Several factors have been proposed as possible explanations for this variation: in particular, the mobility of a population, the resources it uses, the volatility of its environment and the number of individuals in the population. Using a variety of methods, including empirical and ethnographic research, computational models and laboratory-based experiments, researchers have found disparate results regarding each hypothesis. These discordant findings have led to debate over the factors that most significantly influence toolkit size and composition. For instance, several computational, empirical and laboratory studies of food-producing populations have found a positive correlation between the number of individuals in a population and toolkit size, whereas similar studies of hunter-gatherer populations have found little evidence of such a link. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature in this field of study and propose corollaries and interdisciplinary approaches with the goal of reconciling dissimilar findings into a more comprehensive view of cultural toolkit variation. This article is part of the theme issue 'Cross-disciplinary approaches to prehistoric demography'.","344":"In a large-scale SARS-CoV-2 surveillance programme in Madurai, India, we identified equal risk of asymptomatic infection among children, teenagers, and working-age adults, and increasing risk of infection and death associated with older age and comorbidities. Establishing whether surveillance practices or differences in infection severity account for gaps between observed and expected mortality is of crucial importance to establishing the burden of COVID-19 in India.In this prospective, active surveillance study, we used data collected under expanded programmatic surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the district of Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India (population of 3\u2009266\u2009000 individuals). Prospective testing via RT-PCR was done in individuals with fever or acute respiratory symptoms as well as returning travellers, frontline workers, contacts of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, residents of containment zones, patients undergoing medical procedures, and other risk groups. Standardised data collection on symptoms and chronic comorbid conditions was done as part of routine intake. Additionally, seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G was assessed via a cross-sectional survey recruiting adults across 38 clusters within Madurai District from Oct 19, 2020, to Nov 5, 2020. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for positive RT-PCR results comparing individuals by age, sex, comorbid conditions, and aspects of clinical presentation. We estimated case-fatality ratios (CFRs) over the 30-day period following RT-PCR testing stratified by the same variables, and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for death associated with age, sex, and comorbidity. We estimated infection-fatality ratios (IFRs) on the basis of age-specific seroprevalence.Between May 20, 2020, and Oct 31, 2020, 13\u00b75 diagnostic tests were done per 100 inhabitants within Madurai, as compared to 7\u00b79 tests per 100 inhabitants throughout India. From a total of 440\u2009253 RT-PCR tests, 15\u2009781 (3\u00b76%) SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified, with 8720 (5\u00b74%) of 160\u2009273 being positive among individuals with symptoms, and 7061 (2\u00b75%) of 279\u2009980 being positive among individuals without symptoms, at the time of presentation. Estimated aORs for symptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed infection increased continuously by a factor of 4\u00b73 from ages 0-4 years to 80 years or older. By contrast, risk of asymptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed infection did not differ across ages 0-44 years, and thereafter increased by a factor of 1\u00b76 between ages 45-49 years and 80 years or older. Seroprevalence was 40\u00b71% (95% CI 35\u00b78-44\u00b76) at age 15 years or older by the end of the study period, indicating that RT-PCR clinical testing and surveillance testing identified only 1\u00b74% (1\u00b73-1\u00b76%) of all infections in this age group. Among RT-PCR-confirmed cases, older age, male sex, and history of cancer, diabetes, other endocrine disorders, hypertension, other chronic circulatory disorders, respiratory disorders, and chronic kidney disease were each associated with elevated risk of mortality. The CFR among RT-PCR-confirmed cases was 2\u00b74% (2\u00b72-2\u00b76); after age standardisation. At age 15 years or older, the IFR based on reported deaths was 0\u00b7043% (0\u00b7039-0\u00b7049), with reported deaths being only 11\u00b70% (8\u00b72-14\u00b75) of the expected count.For the Hindi translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.SARS-CoV-2 has spread substantially within India over multiple waves of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, the risk factors and disease burden associated with COVID-19 in India remain poorly understood.

In the United States, people of color are known to hold proportionately more high-contact jobs and are thus more at risk of virus infection. At the same time, these ethnic groups are on average younger than the rest of the population. This gives rise to interesting disease dynamics and non-trivial trade-offs that should be taken into consideration when developing prioritization strategies for future mass vaccine roll-outs. Here, we study the spread of COVID-19 through the US population, stratified by age, ethnicity, and occupation, using a detailed, previously-developed compartmental disease model. Based on historic data from the US mass COVID-19 vaccine roll-out that began in December 2020, we show, (i) how ethnic homophily affects the choice of optimal vaccine allocation strategy, (ii) that, notwithstanding potential ethical concerns, differentiating by ethnicity in these strategies can improve outcomes (e.g., fewer deaths), and (iii) that the most likely social context in the United States is very different from the standard assumptions made by models which do not account for ethnicity and this difference affects which allocation strategy is optimal.

Combining objective evidence and the current practice of using principles, experience, and intuitions outperforms a single strategy in MetaMap configurations. Our methodology, reference codes, measurements, results, and workflow are valuable references for optimizing and configuring MetaMap.The percentages of exact matches and missing gold-standard terms were 0.6-0.79 and 0.09-0.3 for one behavior option, and 0.56-0.8 and 0.09-0.3 for two behavior options, respectively. The percentages of exact matches and missing terms for soft cosine similarity scores exceeded those for cosine similarity scores. The average precision, recall, and F-measure were 0.59, 0.82, and 0.68 for exact matches, and 1.00, 0.53, and 0.69 for missing terms, respectively.MetaMap is a valuable tool for processing biomedical texts to identify concepts. Although MetaMap is highly configurative, configuration decisions are not straightforward.To develop a systematic, data-driven methodology for configuring MetaMap for optimal performance.MetaMap, the word2vec model, and the phrase model were used to build a pipeline. For unsupervised training, the phrase and word2vec models used abstracts related to clinical decision support as input. During testing, MetaMap was configured with the default option, one behavior option, and two behavior options. For each configuration, cosine and soft cosine similarity scores between identified entities and gold-standard terms were computed for 40 annotated abstracts (422 sentences). The similarity scores were used to calculate and compare the overall percentages of exact matches, similar matches, and missing gold-standard terms among the abstracts for each configuration. The results were manually spot-checked. The precision, recall, and F-measure (\u03b2 =1) were calculated.","347":"Our models show that a LAIV that is matched with the currently circulating strain is likely to have only modest efficacy. Our results suggest that the efficacy of the vaccine would be increased (optimized) if, rather than being matched to the circulating strain, it is antigenically slightly further from pre-existing immunity compared with the circulating strain. The models also suggest two regimes in which LAIV that is matched to circulating strains may be protective: in children before they have built immunity to circulating strains, and in response to novel strains (such as antigenic shifts) which are at substantial antigenic distance from previously circulating strains. We provide an explanation for the variation in vaccine effectiveness between studies and countries of vaccine effectiveness observed during the 2014-15 influenza season.We use mathematical models to explore how the efficacy of LAIV is affected by the degree of mismatch with the currently circulating influenza strain and interference with pre-existing immunity. The models incorporate three key antigenic distances: the distances between the vaccine strain, pre-existing immunity, and the challenge strain.The effectiveness of the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) can vary widely, ranging from 0 - 50%. The reasons for these discrepancies remain largely unclear.LAIV is offered to children across the world, however, its effectiveness significantly varies between studies. Here, we propose a mechanistic explanation to understand these differences. We further propose a way to select the LAIV strain that would have a higher chance of being protective.","348":"Seasonal influenza is a significant public health concern globally. While influenza vaccines are the single most effective intervention to reduce influenza morbidity and mortality, there is considerable debate surrounding the merits and consequences of repeated seasonal vaccination. Here, we describe a two-season influenza epidemic contact network model and use it to demonstrate that increasing the level of continuity in vaccination across seasons reduces the burden on public health. We show that revaccination reduces the influenza attack rate not only because it reduces the overall number of susceptible individuals, but also because it better protects highly connected individuals, who would otherwise make a disproportionately large contribution to influenza transmission. We also demonstrate that our results hold on an empirical contact network, in the presence of assortativity in vaccination status, and are robust for a range of vaccine coverage and efficacy levels. Our work contributes a population-level perspective to debates about the merits of repeated influenza vaccination and advocates for public health policy to incorporate individual vaccine histories. ","349":"In total, 255925 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results and 2421 positive results for which a viral load was reported, were included in this study. An unweighted overall SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR positivity ratio of 1.27% was observed with strong spatiotemporal differences. SARS-CoV-2 circulated predominantly in 80+ year old individuals across all time periods except between the first and second COVID-19 wave and in 20-30 year old individuals before the second COVID-19 wave. In contrast to the first wave, a significantly higher positivity ratio was observed for the 20-40 age group in addition to the 80+ age group compared to the other age groups during the second wave. The median viral load follows a similar temporal evolution as the positivity rate with an increase ahead of the second wave and highest viral loads observed for 80+ year old individuals.The incidence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in the Belgian community is mainly estimated based on test results of patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-like symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positivity ratio and distribution of viral loads within a cohort of asymptomatic patients screened prior hospitalization or surgery, stratified by age category.There was a high SARS-CoV-2 circulation among asymptomatic patients with a predominance and highest viral loads observed in the elderly. Moreover, ahead of the second COVID-19 wave an increase in median viral load was noted with the highest overall positivity ratio observed in 20-30 year old individuals, indicating they could have been the hidden drivers of this wave.We retrospectively studied data on SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR detection in respiratory tract samples of asymptomatic patients screened pre-hospitalization or pre-surgery in nine Belgian hospitals located in Flanders over a 12-month period (1 April 2020-31 March 2021).","350":"Motivated by the rapid spread of COVID-19 in Mainland China, we use a global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic. The model is calibrated based on internationally reported cases, and shows that at the start of the travel ban from Wuhan on 23 January 2020, most Chinese cities had already received many infected travelers. The travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in Mainland China, but has a more marked effect at the international scale, where case importations were reduced by nearly 80% until mid February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.","351":"Building evolutionarily appropriate baseline models for natural populations is not only important for answering fundamental questions in population genetics-including quantifying the relative contributions of adaptive versus nonadaptive processes-but also essential for identifying candidate loci experiencing relatively rare and episodic forms of selection (e.g., positive or balancing selection). Here, a baseline model was developed for a human population of West African ancestry, the Yoruba, comprising processes constantly operating on the genome (i.e., purifying and background selection, population size changes, recombination rate heterogeneity, and gene conversion). Specifically, to perform joint inference of selective effects with demography, an approximate Bayesian approach was employed that utilizes the decay of background selection effects around functional elements, taking into account genomic architecture. This approach inferred a recent 6-fold population growth together with a distribution of fitness effects that is skewed towards effectively neutral mutations. Importantly, these results further suggest that, although strong and\/or frequent recurrent positive selection is inconsistent with observed data, weak to moderate positive selection is consistent but unidentifiable if rare.","352":"To explore treatment strategy for patients with positive margins after cervical cold knife conization (CKC) by estimating the risk of residual or recurrent CIN2 or worse (CIN2+).A retrospective study included 569 patients receiving CKC for CIN3 in Xiangya Hospital from January 2013 to December 2017. Demographic characteristics and test results were obtained prior to CKC, post CKC at 6,12,24 months and annually thereafter. The primary endpoint was residual\/recurrent CIN2+ post-CKC.14 (2.46%) patients had residual\/recurrent CIN2+ with a median time of occurrence at 12 months post-CKC. Taking the average age and HC2 value as thresholds, the risk of residual\/recurrent CIN2+ was higher in women aged over 40 years or with a baseline HC2 \u2265300 RLU\/PC. Patients with positive margins were at higher risk of residual\/recurrent CIN2+ (HR: 3.66, 95%CI:1.25-10.71), especially when endocervix was involved. 536 (94.20%) patients received HPV testing within 6 months post-CKC. Patients with both positive HPV testing results and positive margins were at the highest risk of residual\/recurrent CIN2+.Patients with positive endocervical margins are at high risk for residual\/recurrent CIN2+, independent of the severity of margins. HPV testing within 6 months post-CKC may be a feasible triage strategy for these patients.","353":"The integrity and functionality of many real-world complex systems hinge on a small set of pivotal nodes, or influencers. In different contexts, these influencers are defined as either structurally important nodes that maintain the connectivity of networks, or dynamically crucial units that can disproportionately impact certain dynamical processes. In practice, identification of the optimal set of influencers in a given system has profound implications in a variety of disciplines. In this review, we survey recent advances in the study of influencer identification developed from different perspectives, and present state-of-the-art solutions designed for different objectives. In particular, we first discuss the problem of finding the minimal number of nodes whose removal would breakdown the network (i.e. the optimal percolation or network dismantle problem), and then survey methods to locate the essential nodes that are capable of shaping global dynamics with either continuous (e.g. independent cascading models) or discontinuous phase transitions (e.g. threshold models). We conclude the review with a summary and an outlook.","354":"Reliable estimates of human mobility are important for understanding the spatial spread of infectious diseases and the effective targeting of control measures. However, when modelling infectious disease dynamics, data on human mobility at an appropriate temporal or spatial resolution are not always available, leading to the common use of model-derived mobility proxies. In this study we reviewed the different data sources and mobility models that have been used to characterise human movement in Africa. We then conducted a simulation study to better understand the implications of using human mobility proxies when predicting the spatial spread and dynamics of infectious diseases. We found major gaps in the availability of empirical measures of human mobility in Africa, leading to mobility proxies being used in place of data. Empirical data on subnational mobility were only available for 17\/54 countries, and in most instances, these data characterised long-term movement patterns, which were unsuitable for modelling the spread of pathogens with short generation times (time between infection of a case and their infector). Results from our simulation study demonstrated that using mobility proxies can have a substantial impact on the predicted epidemic dynamics, with complex and non-intuitive biases. In particular, the predicted times and order of epidemic invasion, and the time of epidemic peak in different locations can be underestimated or overestimated, depending on the types of proxies used and the country of interest. Our work underscores the need for regularly updated empirical measures of population movement within and between countries to aid the prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks. At the same time, there is a need to establish an evidence base to help understand which types of mobility data are most appropriate for describing the spread of emerging infectious diseases in different settings.","355":"Nigeria recorded one of the earliest outbreaks of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) virus H5N1 in 2006, which spread to other African countries. In 2023, 18 countries reported outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry, with human cases documented in Egypt, Nigeria, and Djibouti. There is limited information on the molecular epidemiology of HPAI H5N1 in Nigeria. We determined the molecular epidemiology and genetic evolution of the virus from 2006 to 2021. We investigated the trend and geographical distribution across Nigeria. The evolutionary history of 61 full-length genomes was performed from 13 countries worldwide, and compared with sequences obtained from the early outbreaks in Nigeria up to 2021. MEGA 11 was used to determine the phylogenetic relationships of H5N1 strains, which revealed close ancestry between sequences in Nigeria and those from other African countries. Clade classification was performed using the subspecies classification tool for Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Research Center (BV-BRC) version 3.35.5. H5N1 Clade 2.2 was observed in 2006, with 2.3.2, 2.3.2.1f clades observed afterwards and 2.3.4.4b in 2021. Our findings underscore the need for genomics surveillance to track antigenic variation and clades switching to monitor the epidemiological of the virus and safeguard human and animal health.Impacts Specific variations in the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of Avian influenza virus are consistent in different geographical regions. H5N1 Clade 2.2 was reported in 2006, with 2.3.2, 2.3.2.1f afterwards and 2.3.4.4b in 2021. Nigeria is an epicentre for avian influenza with three major migratory routes for wild birds transversing the country. It is plausible that the Avian influenza in Northern Nigeria may be linked to wild bird sanctuaries in the region.","356":"This work was supported by a cooperative agreement between the Henry M.

We combined data from four studies that tested three interventions (vorinostat\/hydroxychloroquine\/maraviroc before ATI, Ad26\/MVA vaccination before ATI, and VRC01 antibody infusion during ATI).We show that higher viral loads in acute HIV-1 infection were associated with faster viral rebound, demonstrating that the initial stage of HIV-1 infection before ART initiation has a strong impact on viral rebound post-ATI years later.Participants had homogeneous demographic and clinical characteristics. Because an antiviral effect was seen in participants who received VRC01 infusion post-ATI, these participants were excluded from the analysis, permitting a pooled analysis of 53 participants. Time to viral rebound was significantly associated with variables measured at the beginning of infection: pre-antiretroviral therapy (ART) viral load (HR\u00a0= 1.34, p\u00a0= 0.022), time to viral suppression post-ART initiation (HR\u00a0= 1.07, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and area under the viral load curve (HR\u00a0= 1.34, p\u00a0= 0.026).","357":"Measles threatens the lives and livelihoods of tens of millions of children and there are countries where routine immunization systems miss enough individuals to create the risk of large outbreaks. To help address this threat, measles supplementary immunization activities are time-limited, coordinated campaigns to immunize en masse a target population. Timing campaigns to be concurrent with building outbreak risk is an important consideration, but current programmatic standards focus on campaigns achieving a high coverage of at least 95%. We show that there is a dramatic trade-off between campaign timeliness and coverage. Optimal timing at coverages as low as 50% for areas with weak routine immunization systems is shown to outperform the current standard, which is delayed by as little as 6 months. Measured coverage alone is revealed as a potentially misleading performance metric.","358":"Dengue has broadened its global distribution substantially in the past two decades, and many endemic areas are experiencing increases in incidence. The Dominican Republic recently experienced its two largest outbreaks to date with 16,836 reported cases in 2015 and 20,123 reported cases in 2019. With continued increases in dengue transmission, developing tools to better prepare healthcare systems and mosquito control agencies is of critical importance. Before such tools can be developed, however, we must first better understand potential drivers of dengue transmission. To that end, we focus in this paper on determining relationships between climate variables and dengue transmission with an emphasis on eight provinces and the capital city of the Dominican Republic in the period 2015-2019. We present summary statistics for dengue cases, temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity in this period, and we conduct an analysis of correlated lags between climate variables and dengue cases as well as correlated lags among dengue cases in each of the nine locations. We find that the southwestern province of Barahona had the largest dengue incidence in both 2015 and 2019. Among all climate variables considered, lags between relative humidity variables and dengue cases were the most frequently correlated. We found that most locations had significant correlations with cases in other locations at lags of zero weeks. These results can be used to improve predictive models of dengue transmission in the country.","359":"The cohort was split case-wise into training (n\u2009=\u2009159, 31 with 10-year recurrence) and validation (n\u2009=\u2009185, 26 with 10-year recurrence) sets. The sections from primary tumors were stained with H&E, then digitized and analyzed by the pipeline. In the first step, a classifier trained manually by pathologists was applied to digital slides to annotate the areas of stroma, normal\/benign ducts, cancer ducts, dense lymphocyte region, and blood vessels. In the second step, a recurrence risk classifier was trained on eight select architectural and spatial organization tissue features from the annotated areas to predict recurrence risk.The recurrence classifier significantly predicted the 10-year recurrence risk in the training [hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u200911.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.3-25.3, accuracy (Acc)\u2009=\u20090.87, sensitivity (Sn)\u2009=\u20090.71, and specificity (Sp)\u2009=\u20090.91] and independent validation [HR\u2009=\u20096.39 (95% CI 3.0-13.8), p\u2009<\u20090.0001;Acc\u2009=\u20090.85, Sn\u2009=\u20090.5, Sp\u2009=\u20090.91] cohorts.

The overall risk for DCIS patients treated with breast-conserving surgery stems almost exclusively from local recurrence. Although a mastectomy or adjuvant radiation can reduce recurrence risk, there are significant concerns regarding patient over-\/under-treatment. Current clinicopathological markers are insufficient to accurately assess the recurrence risk. To address this issue, we developed a novel machine learning (ML) pipeline to predict risk of ipsilateral recurrence using digitized whole slide images (WSI) and clinicopathologic long-term outcome data from a retrospectively collected cohort of DCIS patients (n\u2009=\u2009344) treated with lumpectomy at Nottingham University Hospital, UK.","360":"When analysing in vitro data, growth kinetics of influenza virus strains are often compared by computing their growth rates, which are sometimes used as proxies for fitness. However, analogous to mathematical models for epidemics, the growth rate can be defined as a function of mechanistic traits: the basic reproduction number (the average number of cells each infected cell infects) and the mean generation time (the average length of a replication cycle). Fitting a model to previously published and newly generated data from experiments in human lung cells, we compared estimates of growth rate, reproduction number and generation time for six influenza A strains. Of four strains in previously published data, A\/Canada\/RV733\/2003 (seasonal H1N1) had the lowest basic reproduction number, followed by A\/Mexico\/INDRE4487\/2009 (pandemic H1N1), then A\/Indonesia\/05\/2005 (spill-over H5N1) and A\/Anhui\/1\/2013 (spill-over H7N9). This ordering of strains was preserved for both generation time and growth rate, suggesting a positive biological correlation between these quantities which have not been previously observed. We further investigated these potential correlations using data from reassortant viruses with different internal proteins (from A\/England\/195\/2009 (pandemic H1N1) and A\/Turkey\/05\/2005 (H5N1)), and the same surface proteins (from A\/Puerto Rico\/8\/34 (lab-adapted H1N1)). Similar correlations between traits were observed for these viruses, confirming our initial findings and suggesting that these patterns were related to the degree of human adaptation of internal genes. Also, the model predicted that strains with a smaller basic reproduction number, shorter generation time and slower growth rate underwent more replication cycles by the time of peak viral load, potentially accumulating mutations more quickly. These results illustrate the utility of mathematical models in inferring traits driving observed differences in in vitro growth of influenza strains.","361":"White dwarfs represent the final state of evolution for most stars1-3. Certain classes of white dwarfs pulsate4,5, leading to observable brightness variations, and analysis of these variations\u00a0with theoretical stellar models probes their internal structure. Modelling of these pulsating stars provides stringent tests of white dwarf models and a detailed picture of the outcome of the late stages of stellar evolution6. However, the high-energy-density states that\u00a0exist in white dwarfs are extremely difficult to reach and to measure in the laboratory, so theoretical predictions are largely untested at these conditions. Here we report measurements of the relationship between pressure and density along the principal shock Hugoniot (equations describing the state of the sample material before and after the passage of the shock derived from conservation laws) of hydrocarbon to within five per cent. The observed maximum compressibility is consistent with theoretical models that include detailed electronic structure. This is relevant for the equation of state of matter at pressures ranging from 100 million to 450 million atmospheres, where the understanding of white dwarf physics is sensitive to the equation of state and where models differ considerably. The measurements test these equation-of-state relations that\u00a0are used in the\u00a0modelling of white dwarfs and inertial confinement fusion experiments7,8, and we predict an increase in compressibility due to ionization of the inner-core orbitals of carbon. We also find that a detailed treatment of the electronic structure and the electron degeneracy pressure is required to capture the measured shape of the pressure-density evolution for hydrocarbon before peak compression. Our results illuminate the equation of state of the white dwarf envelope (the region surrounding\u00a0the stellar core that contains partially ionized and partially degenerate non-ideal plasmas), which is a\u00a0weak link in the constitutive\u00a0physics\u00a0informing the structure and evolution of white dwarf stars9.","362":"-test, and correlations between cholesterol concentration and histological score, and between the score for the two receptors were determined using a Spearman correlation. The high expression level of these lipoprotein receptors on most of the tumors could underlie the lack of relationship between score and tumor grade. The overexpression of LDL-R and SR-B1 in canine lymphoma holds therapeutic potential particularly in dogs that overexpress one or both of these receptors, and this warrants further investigation.","363":"This decision analytical model study used combined data from US CICT programs (eg, proportion of cases interviewed, contacts notified or monitored, and days to case and contact notification) with incidence data to model outcomes of CICT over a 60-day period (November 25, 2020, to January 23, 2021). The study estimated a range of outcomes by varying assumed compliance with isolation and quarantine recommendations. Fifty-nine state and territorial health departments that received federal funding supporting COVID-19 pandemic response activities were eligible for inclusion. Data analysis was performed from July to September 2021.To estimate COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations averted nationwide by US states' CICT programs.Evidence of the impact of COVID-19 case investigation and contact tracing (CICT) programs is lacking, but policy makers need this evidence to assess the value of such programs.Public health case investigation and contact tracing.In total, 22 states and 1 territory reported all measures necessary for the analysis. These 23 jurisdictions covered 42.5% of the US population (approximately 140 million persons), spanned all 4 US Census regions, and reported data that reflected all 59 federally funded CICT programs. This study estimated that 1.11 million cases and 27\u202f231 hospitalizations were averted by CICT programs under a scenario where 80% of interviewed cases and monitored contacts and 30% of notified contacts fully complied with isolation and quarantine guidance, eliminating their contributions to future transmission. As many as 1.36 million cases and 33\u202f527 hospitalizations could have been prevented if all interviewed cases and monitored contacts had entered into and fully complied with isolation and quarantine guidelines upon being interviewed or notified. Across both scenarios and all jurisdictions, CICT averted an estimated median of 21.2% (range, 1.3%-65.8%) of the cases not prevented by vaccination and other nonpharmaceutical interventions.The primary outcomes were numbers of cases and hospitalizations averted and the percentage of cases averted among cases not prevented by vaccination and other nonpharmaceutical interventions.These findings suggest that CICT programs likely had a substantial role in curtailing the pandemic in most jurisdictions during the 2020 to 2021 winter peak. Differences in outcomes across jurisdictions indicate an opportunity to further improve CICT effectiveness. These estimates demonstrate the potential benefits from sustaining and improving these programs.","364":"We estimate the distribution of serial intervals for 468 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported in 93 Chinese cities by February 8, 2020. The mean and standard deviation are 3.96 (95% CI 3.53-4.39) and 4.75 (95% CI 4.46-5.07) days, respectively, with 12.6% of reports indicating pre-symptomatic transmission.","365":"During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the United Kingdom government imposed public health policies in England to reduce social contacts in hopes of curbing virus transmission. We conducted a repeated cross-sectional study to measure contact patterns weekly from March 2020 to March 2021 to estimate the impact of these policies, covering 3 national lockdowns interspersed by periods of less restrictive policies.The repeated cross-sectional survey data were collected using online surveys of representative samples of the UK population by age and gender. Survey participants were recruited by the online market research company Ipsos MORI through internet-based banner and social media ads and email campaigns. The participant data used for this analysis are restricted to those who reported living in England. We calculated the mean daily contacts reported using a (clustered) bootstrap and fitted a censored negative binomial model to estimate age-stratified contact matrices and estimate proportional changes to the basic reproduction number under controlled conditions using the change in contacts as a scaling factor. To put the findings in perspective, we discuss contact rates recorded throughout the year in terms of previously recorded rates from the POLYMOD study social contact study. The survey recorded 101,350 observations from 19,914 participants who reported 466,710 contacts over 53 weeks. We observed changes in social contact patterns in England over time and by participants' age, personal risk factors, and perception of risk. The mean reported contacts for adults 18 to 59 years old ranged between 2.39 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.20 to 2.60) contacts and 4.93 (95% CI 4.65 to 5.19) contacts during the study period. The mean contacts for school-age children (5 to 17 years old) ranged from 3.07 (95% CI 2.89 to 3.27) to 15.11 (95% CI 13.87 to 16.41). This demonstrates a sustained decrease in social contacts compared to a mean of 11.08 (95% CI 10.54 to 11.57) contacts per participant in all age groups combined as measured by the POLYMOD social contact study in 2005 to 2006. Contacts measured during periods of lockdowns were lower than in periods of eased social restrictions. The use of face coverings outside the home has remained high since the government mandated use in some settings in July 2020. The main limitations of this analysis are the potential for selection bias, as participants are recruited through internet-based campaigns, and recall bias, in which participants may under- or overreport the number of contacts they have made.In this study, we observed that recorded contacts reduced dramatically compared to prepandemic levels (as measured in the POLYMOD study), with changes in reported contacts correlated with government interventions throughout the pandemic. Despite easing of restrictions in the summer of 2020, the mean number of reported contacts only returned to about half of that observed prepandemic at its highest recorded level. The CoMix survey provides a unique repeated cross-sectional data set for a full year in England, from the first day of the first lockdown, for use in statistical analyses and mathematical modelling of COVID-19 and other diseases.","366":"As of July 15, 2015, the South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare had reported 186 case-patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome in South Korea. For 159 case-patients with known outcomes and complete case histories, we found that older age and preexisting concurrent health conditions were risk factors for death. ","367":"Classification of the Class Echinoidea is under significant revision in light of emerging molecular phylogenetic evidence. In particular, the sister-group relationships within the superorder Luminacea (Echinoidea: Irregularia) have been considerably updated. However, the placement of many families remains largely unresolved due to a series of incongruent evidence obtained from morphological, paleontological, and genetic data for the majority of extant representatives. In this study, we investigated the phylogenetic relationships of 25 taxa, belonging to eleven luminacean families. We proposed three new superfamilies: Astriclypeoidea, Mellitoidea, and Taiwanasteroidea (including Dendrasteridae, Taiwanasteridae, Scutellidae, and Echinarachniidae), instead of the currently recognized superfamily Scutelloidea Gray, 1825. In light of the new data obtained from ten additional species, the historical biogeography reconstructed shows that the tropical western Pacific and eastern Indian Oceans are the cradle for early sand dollar diversification. Hothouse conditions during the late Cretaceous and early Paleogene were coupled with diversification events of major clades of sand dollars. We also demonstrate that Taiwan fauna can play a key role in terms of understanding the major Cenozoic migration and dispersal events in the evolutionary history of Luminacea.","368":"This study concludes that despite the emergence of new variants, vaccines remain highly correlated with reduced COVID-19 harm. Therefore, given the ongoing threat posed by COVID-19, vaccines remain a critical line of defense for protecting the public and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.Our study revealed a strong and statistically significant negative association between vaccine uptake and COVID-19 CHR across each variant wave, with boosters providing additional protection during the Omicron wave. Higher underlying population immunity is shown to be associated with reduced COVID-19 CHR. Additionally, more stringent government policies are generally associated with decreased CHR. However, the impact of activity-related engagement levels on COVID-19 health outcomes varied across different waves. Regarding static variables, the social vulnerability index consistently exhibits positive associations with CHR, while Medicaid spending per person consistently shows a negative association. However, the impacts of other static factors vary in magnitude and significance across different waves.In this study, we analyze the association between time-dependent vaccination rates and COVID-19 health outcomes for 48 U.S. states. We primarily focus on case-hospitalization risk (CHR) as the outcome of interest, using it as a population-level proxy for disease burden on healthcare systems. Performing the analysis using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) allowed us to incorporate real-world nonlinearities and control for critical dynamic (time-changing) and static (temporally constant) factors. Dynamic factors include testing rates, activity-related engagement levels in the population, underlying population immunity, and policy. Static factors incorporate comorbidities, social vulnerability, race, and state healthcare expenditures. We used SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance data to model the different COVID-19 variant-driven waves separately, and evaluate if there is a changing role of the potential drivers of health outcomes across waves.Population-level vaccine efficacy is a critical component of understanding COVID-19 risk, informing public health policy, and mitigating disease impacts. Unlike individual-level clinical trials, population-level analysis characterizes how well vaccines worked in the face of real-world challenges like emerging variants, differing mobility patterns, and policy changes.","369":"Increasing the availability of antigen rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is key to alleviating global SARS-CoV-2 testing inequity (median testing rate in December 2021-March 2022 when the Omicron variant was spreading in multiple countries; high-income countries\u2009=\u2009600 tests\/100,000 people\/day; LMICs\u2009=\u200914 tests\/100,000 people\/day). However, target testing levels and effectiveness of asymptomatic community screening to impact SARS-CoV-2 transmission in LMICs are unclear.Testing strategies aimed at reducing transmission should prioritize symptomatic testing and incentivizing test-positive individuals to adhere to isolation to maximize effectiveness.We used PATAT, an LMIC-focused agent-based model to simulate COVID-19 epidemics, varying the amount of Ag-RDTs available for symptomatic testing at healthcare facilities and asymptomatic community testing in different social settings. We assumed that testing was a function of access to healthcare facilities and availability of Ag-RDTs. We explicitly modelled symptomatic testing demand from non-SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and measured impact based on the number of infections averted due to test-and-isolate.Testing symptomatic individuals yields greater benefits than any asymptomatic community testing strategy until most symptomatic individuals who sought testing have been tested. Meeting symptomatic testing demand likely requires at least 200-400 tests\/100,000 people\/day on average as symptomatic testing demand is highly influenced by non-SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. After symptomatic testing demand is satisfied, excess tests to proactively screen for asymptomatic infections among household members yields the largest additional infections averted.","370":"CyanoHAB exposure case rates increased 2010-2022, despite a decrease in all-cause exposure cases during the same period. NPDS data provide valuable public health information for characterization of cyanoHAB exposures, an emerging public health challenge.Over half of cyanoHAB exposure cases were children\u2009<\u200920 years old (n\u2009=\u20092175). Most cyanoHABs exposures occurred in a \"public area\" (n\u2009=\u20092902, 68.1%); most were acute (\u2264\u20098\u00a0h) (n\u2009=\u20093824, 89.8%). Dermal and ingestion routes and gastrointestinal effects predominated. 2% (n\u2009=\u2009102) of cases experienced a moderate or major medical outcome; no deaths were reported. National rates increased from 0.4 cases\/1\u00a0million (1\u00a0M) person-years in 2010 to 1.4 cases\/1\u00a0M person-years in 2022. The Mountain division had the highest 13-year rate (7.8 cases\/1\u00a0M person-years).Harmful algal bloom occurrences have been increasingly reported globally and over time. Exposure to the variety of toxins and co-contaminants that may be present in harmful algal blooms can cause illness and even death. Poison control data is a valuable public health information source that has been used to characterize many types of toxin exposures, including harmful algal blooms. Prior studies have been limited by location and time, and knowledge gaps remain regarding cyanobacteria harmful algal bloom (cyanoHAB) exposure circumstances, and the breadth and severity of associated clinical effect.The objective of this study was to characterize epidemiologic and clinical features of cyanoHAB exposure cases reported to 55 US poison control centers and available in the National Poison Data System (NPDS). We identified 4260 NPDS cyanoHAB exposure cases reported from 2010 to 2022, including symptomatic exposure cases with and without clinical effects related to the exposure and asymptomatic exposure cases. We assessed demographics; exposure routes, locations, chronicity; clinical effects; and medical outcomes. We calculated case rates annually and 13-year case rates by US geographic division.","371":"The period of protection from repeat infection following symptomatic influenza is not well established due to limited availability of longitudinal data. Using data from a pediatric cohort in Managua, Nicaragua, we examine the effects of natural influenza virus infection on subsequent infection with the same influenza virus subtype\/lineage across multiple seasons, totaling 2,170 RT-PCR-confirmed symptomatic influenza infections. Logistic regression models assessed whether infection in the prior influenza season protected against homologous reinfection. We sequenced viruses from 2011-2019 identifying dominant clades and measuring antigenic distances between hemagglutinin clades. We observe homotypic protection from repeat infection in children infected with influenza A\/H1N1pdm (OR 0.12, CI 0.02-0.88), A\/H3N2 (OR 0.41, CI 0.24-0.73), and B\/Victoria (OR 0.00, CI 0.00-0.14), but not with B\/Yamagata viruses (OR 0.60, CI 0.09-2.10). Overall, protection wanes as time or antigenic distance increases. Individuals infected with one subtype or lineage of influenza virus have significantly lower odds of homologous reinfection for the following one to two years; after two years this protection wanes. This protection is demonstrated across multiple seasons, subtypes, and lineages among children.","372":"COVID-19, the global pandemic, has significantly interrupted the provision of oral health care to many individuals. This study aims to evaluate patients' attitudes to and perceptions of dental visits in the COVID-19 pandemic and assess if socio-economic status influences their perception of risk associated with dental visits. Patients attending the dental clinic were invited to participate in this study by completing a questionnaire administered in August 2021. Composite indicators for access, attitude, perception and socio-economic status were created based on subsets of questions. A total of 247 completed questionnaires were obtained. Analysis was performed with the perception, attitude and access indicators against the socio-economic status indicator. This study found that there is a statistically significant difference between socio-economic groups and their attitudes and perceptions around dental health care services in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals from lower socio-economic status groups were less influenced by the pandemic. Participants from higher socio-economic status groups were found to be more cautious around COVID-19 and its risks.","373":"The goal of many vaccination programs is to attain the population immunity above which pathogens introduced by infectious people (e.g., travelers from endemic areas) will not cause outbreaks. Using a simple meta-population model, we demonstrate that, if sub-populations either differ in characteristics affecting their basic reproduction numbers or if their members mix preferentially, weighted average sub-population immunities cannot be compared with the proportionally-mixing homogeneous population-immunity threshold, as public health practitioners are wont to do. Then we review the effect of heterogeneity in average per capita contact rates on the basic meta-population reproduction number. To the extent that population density affects contacts, for example, rates might differ in urban and rural sub-populations. Other differences among sub-populations in characteristics affecting their basic reproduction numbers would contribute similarly. In agreement with more recent results, we show that heterogeneous preferential mixing among sub-populations increases the basic meta-population reproduction number more than homogeneous preferential mixing does. Next we refine earlier results on the effects of heterogeneity in sub-population immunities and preferential mixing on the effective meta-population reproduction number. Finally, we propose the vector of partial derivatives of this reproduction number with respect to the sub-population immunities as a fundamentally new tool for targeting vaccination efforts. ","374":"This corrects the article DOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevE.92.042105. ","375":"Many invasive species managers state that their objective is to control an invader. However, the appropriate choice of a management option requires a more explicit statement of management objectives, in terms of both the relevant time horizon and spatial scale. Using data from a 2-yr mowing experiment, we show that the most effective management strategy for controlling an invasive thistle depends fundamentally on the management goals. We integrate field data from a two-cohort experiment with modeling to assess 14 mowing treatments (differing in intensity, frequency, and timing, and thus also in their required logistical effort) based on their effectiveness in (1) reducing population density of the existing cohort, (2) decreasing projected long-term population growth, and (3) limiting projected population spread of an invasive thistle, musk thistle (Carduus nutans L.). The treatment with high intensity and a single late mow caused the largest reduction in plant survival (and density of existing adult plants); the treatment with high intensity and an early mow in addition to a late mow was most effective at reducing population growth rate and population spread. Against expectation and conventional wisdom, the most frequent mowing treatment did not provide the most effective management outcome for any stated objective. This study highlights the necessity of clearly defined management aims; the term control is too vague to be truly useful. The results also provide important insights for the management of this invasive species.","376":"Bluetongue virus is a vector-borne pathogen affecting ruminants that has caused major epidemics in France. Reconstructing the history of bluetongue in French cattle under control strategies such as vaccination has been hampered by the high level of sub-clinical infection, incomplete case data and poor understanding of vaccine uptake over time and space. To tackle these challenges, we used three age-structured serological surveys carried out in cattle (N\u202f=\u202f22,342) from ten administrative subdivisions called departments. We fitted catalytic models within a Bayesian MCMC framework to reconstruct the force of seroconversion from infection or vaccination, and the population-level susceptibility per semester between 2007 and 2016. In the departments of the study area, we estimated that 36% of cattle had been infected prior to vaccine rollout that became compulsory from July 2008. The last outbreak case was notified in December 2009, at which time 83% of the animals were seropositive, under the cumulative effect of vaccination and infection. The probability of seroconversion per semester dropped below 10% after 2010 when vaccination became optional. Vaccine uptake was smaller during the 2012 campaign than during the one in 2011, with strong regional contrasts. Eighty four percent of cattle were susceptible when bluetongue re-emerged in 2015. Thus, serological surveys can be used to estimate vaccine uptake and the magnitude of infection, the relative effect of which can sometimes be inferred using prior knowledge on reported incidence and vaccination dates.","377":"Many studies have used mobile device location data to model SARS-CoV-2 dynamics, yet relationships between mobility behavior and endemic respiratory pathogens are less understood. We studied the effects of population mobility on the transmission of 17 endemic viruses and SARS-CoV-2 in Seattle over a 4-year period, 2018-2022. Before 2020, visits to schools and daycares, within-city mixing, and visitor inflow preceded or coincided with seasonal outbreaks of endemic viruses. Pathogen circulation dropped substantially after the initiation of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders in March 2020. During this period, mobility was a positive, leading indicator of transmission of all endemic viruses and lagging and negatively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 activity. Mobility was briefly predictive of SARS-CoV-2 transmission when restrictions relaxed but associations weakened in subsequent waves. The rebound of endemic viruses was heterogeneously timed but exhibited stronger, longer-lasting relationships with mobility than SARS-CoV-2. Overall, mobility is most predictive of respiratory virus transmission during periods of dramatic behavioral change and at the beginning of epidemic waves.","378":"Spatiotemporal Bayesian modelling was used to investigate the monthly relationship, and model selection criteria were used to evaluate the performance of the models and weather variable specifications. As the malaria control and elimination situation was spatially and temporally dynamic during the study period, the association was examined annually at the provincial level.Malaria remains prevalent in Lao PDR, particularly in the south, and the relationship with weather varies between regions but was strongest for rainfall and maximum humidity for both species. During peak periods with suitable weather conditions, vector control activities and raising public health awareness on the proper usage of intervention measures, such as indoor residual spraying and personal protection, should be prioritized.Malaria incidence decreased from 2010 to 2022 and was concentrated in the southern regions for both P. falciparum and P. vivax. Rainfall and maximum humidity were identified as most strongly associated with malaria during the study period. Rainfall was associated with P. falciparum incidence in the north and central regions during 2010-2011, and with P. vivax incidence in the north and central regions during 2012-2015. Maximum humidity was persistently associated with P. falciparum and P. vivax incidence in the south.The government of Lao PDR has increased efforts to control malaria transmission in order to reach its national elimination goal by 2030. Weather can influence malaria transmission dynamics and should be considered when assessing the impact of elimination interventions but this relationship has not been well characterized in Lao PDR. This study examined the space-time association between climate variables and Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria incidence from 2010 to 2022.","379":"DERR1-10.2196\/45801.A total of 200 participants with HF, aged \u226545 years, will be recruited and randomized into 2 groups: the SCDG playing group (intervention group) and sensor-only group (control group). Both groups will receive a weight scale, physical activity tracker, and accompanying app, whereas only the intervention group will play the SCDG. This design, thereby, assesses the contributions of the game. All participants will complete a baseline survey as well as posttests at 6 and 12 weeks to assess the immediate effect of the intervention. They will also complete a third posttest at 24 weeks to assess the maintenance of behavioral changes. Efficacy and benefits will be assessed by measuring improvements in HF-related proximal outcomes (self-management behaviors of daily weight monitoring and physical activity) and distal outcomes (HF hospitalization, quality of life, and functional status) between baseline and weeks 6, 12, and 24. The primary outcome measured will be days with weight monitoring, for which this design provides at least 80% power to detect differences between the 2 groups.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05056129; https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT05056129.This project will generate insight and guidance for scalable and easy-to-use digital gaming solutions to motivate persistent adherence to HF self-management behaviors and improve health outcomes among individuals with HF.This randomized clinical trial aims to assess the efficacy of a SCDG in integrating the behavioral data of participants with HF from weight scale and activity tracker sensors to activate game progress, rewards, and feedback and, ultimately, to improve adherence to important self-management behaviors.Heart failure (HF) is the leading cause of hospitalization among older adults in the United States. There are substantial racial and geographic disparities in HF outcomes, with patients living in southern US states having a mortality rate 69% higher than the national average. Self-management behaviors, particularly daily weight monitoring and physical activity, are extremely important in improving HF outcomes; however, patients typically have particularly low adherence to these behaviors. With the rise of digital technologies to improve health outcomes and motivate health behaviors, sensor-controlled digital games (SCDGs) have become a promising approach. SCDGs, which leverage sensor-connected technologies, offer the benefits of being portable and scalable and allowing for continuous observation and motivation of health behaviors in their real-world contexts. They are also becoming increasingly popular among older adults and offer an immersive and accessible way to measure self-management behaviors and improve adherence. No SCDGs have been designed for older adults or evaluated to test their outcomes.Recruitment began in the fall of 2022, and the first patient was enrolled in the study on November 7, 2022. Recruitment of the last participant is expected in quarter 1 of 2025. Publication of complete results and data from this study is expected in 2026.","380":"Longitudinal tracking of individual Plasmodium falciparum strains in multi-clonal infections is essential for investigating infection dynamics of malaria. The traditional genotyping techniques did not permit tracking changes in individual clone density during persistent natural infections. Amplicon deep sequencing (Amp-Seq) offers a tool to address this knowledge gap. The sensitivity of Amp-Seq for relative quantification of clones was investigated using three molecular markers, ama1-D2, ama1-D3, and cpmp. Amp-Seq and length-polymorphism based genotyping were compared for their performance in following minority clones in longitudinal samples from Papua New Guinea. Amp-Seq markers were superior to length-polymorphic marker msp2 in detecting minority clones (sensitivity Amp-Seq: 95%, msp2: 85%). Multiplicity of infection (MOI) by Amp-Seq was 2.32 versus 1.73 for msp2. The higher sensitivity had no effect on estimates of force of infection because missed minority clones were detected in preceding or succeeding bleeds. Individual clone densities were tracked longitudinally by Amp-Seq despite MOI\u2009>\u20091, thus providing an additional parameter for investigating malaria infection dynamics. Amp-Seq based genotyping of longitudinal samples improves detection of minority clones and estimates of MOI. Amp-Seq permits tracking of clone density over time to study clone competition or the dynamics of specific, i.e. resistance-associated genotypes.","381":"Following the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in spring 2020, Europe experienced a resurgence of the virus starting late summer that was deadlier and more difficult to contain. Relaxed intervention measures and summer travel have been implicated as drivers of the second wave. Here, we build a phylogeographic model to evaluate how newly introduced lineages, as opposed to the rekindling of persistent lineages, contributed to the COVID-19 resurgence in Europe. We inform this model using genomic, mobility and epidemiological data from 10 West European countries and estimate that in many countries more than 50% of the lineages circulating in late summer resulted from new introductions since June 15th. The success in onwards transmission of these lineages is predicted by SARS-CoV-2 incidence during this period. Relatively early introductions from Spain into the United Kingdom contributed to the successful spread of the 20A.EU1\/B.1.177 variant. The pervasive spread of variants that have not been associated with an advantage in transmissibility highlights the threat of novel variants of concern that emerged more recently and have been disseminated by holiday travel. Our findings indicate that more effective and coordinated measures are required to contain spread through cross-border travel.","382":"Elevating herd immunity level against rubella is essential to prevent congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Insufficient vaccination coverage left susceptible pockets among adults in Japan, and the outbreak of rubella from 2012 to 2013 resulted in 45 observed CRS cases. Given a limited stock of rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) available, the Japanese government recommended healthcare providers to prioritize vaccination to those confirmed with low level of immunity, or to those likely to transmit to pregnant women. Although a test-and-vaccinate policy could potentially help reduce the use of the limited stockpile of vaccines, by selectively elevating herd immunity, the cost of serological testing is generally high and comparable to the vaccine itself. Here, we aimed to examine whether random vaccination would be more cost-beneficial than the test-and-vaccinate strategy. A mathematical model was employed to evaluate the vaccination policy implemented in 2012-2013, quantifying the benefit-to-cost ratio to achieve herd immunity. The modelling exercise demonstrated that, while the test-and-vaccinate strategy can efficiently achieve herd immunity when stockpiles of RCV are limited, random vaccination would be a more cost-beneficial strategy. As long as the herd immunity acts as the goal of vaccination, our findings apply to future supplementary immunization strategy.","383":"The global burden of infectious diseases and the increased attention to natural, accidental, and deliberate biological threats has resulted in significant investment in infectious disease research. Translating the results of these studies to inform prevention, detection, and response efforts often can be challenging, especially if prior relationships and communications have not been established with decision-makers. Whatever scientific information is shared with decision-makers before, during, and after public health emergencies is highly dependent on the individuals or organizations who are communicating with policy-makers. This article briefly describes the landscape of stakeholders involved in information-sharing before and during emergencies. We identify critical gaps in translation of scientific expertise and results, and biosafety and biosecurity measures to public health policy and practice with a focus on One Health and zoonotic diseases. Finally, we conclude by exploring ways of improving communication and funding, both of which help to address the identified gaps. By leveraging existing scientific information (from both the natural and social sciences) in the public health decision-making process, large-scale outbreaks may be averted even in low-income countries.","384":"Background: Non-fatal outcomes of disease and injury increasingly detract from the ability of the world's population to live in full health, a trend largely attributable to an epidemiological transition in many countries from causes affecting children, to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) more common in adults. For the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015), we estimated the incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for diseases and injuries at the global, regional, and national scale over the period of 1990 to 2015. Methods: We estimated incidence and prevalence by age, sex, cause, year, and geography with a wide range of updated and standardised analytical procedures. Improvements from GBD 2013 included the addition of new data sources, updates to literature reviews for 85 causes, and the identification and inclusion of additional studies published up to November, 2015, to expand the database used for estimation of non-fatal outcomes to 60 900 unique data sources. Prevalence and incidence by cause and sequelae were determined with DisMod-MR 2.1, an improved version of the DisMod-MR Bayesian meta-regression tool first developed for GBD 2010 and GBD 2013. For some causes, we used alternative modelling strategies where the complexity of the disease was not suited to DisMod-MR 2.1 or where incidence and prevalence needed to be determined from other data. For GBD 2015 we created a summary indicator that combines measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility (the Socio-demographic Index [SDI]) and used it to compare observed patterns of health loss to the expected pattern for countries or locations with similar SDI scores. Findings: We generated 9\u00b73 billion estimates from the various combinations of prevalence, incidence, and YLDs for causes, sequelae, and impairments by age, sex, geography, and year. In 2015, two causes had acute incidences in excess of 1 billion: upper respiratory infections (17\u00b72 billion, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 15\u00b74\u009619\u00b72 billion) and diarrhoeal diseases (2\u00b739 billion, 2\u00b730\u00962\u00b750 billion). Eight causes of chronic disease and injury each affected more than 10% of the world's population in 2015: permanent caries, tension-type headache, iron-deficiency anaemia, age-related and other hearing loss, migraine, genital herpes, refraction and accommodation disorders, and ascariasis. The impairment that affected the greatest number of people in 2015 was anaemia, with 2\u00b736 billion (2\u00b735\u00962\u00b737 billion) individuals affected. The second and third leading impairments by number of individuals affected were hearing loss and vision loss, respectively. Between 2005 and 2015, there was little change in the leading causes of years lived with disability (YLDs) on a global basis. NCDs accounted for 18 of the leading 20 causes of age-standardised YLDs on a global scale. Where rates were decreasing, the rate of decrease for YLDs was slower than that of years of life lost (YLLs) for nearly every cause included in our analysis. For low SDI geographies, Group 1 causes typically accounted for 20\u009630% of total disability, largely attributable to nutritional deficiencies, malaria, neglected tropical diseases, HIV\/AIDS, and tuberculosis. Lower back and neck pain was the leading global cause of disability in 2015 in most countries. The leading cause was sense organ disorders in 22 countries in Asia and Africa and one in central Latin America; diabetes in four countries in Oceania; HIV\/AIDS in three southern sub-Saharan African countries; collective violence and legal intervention in two north African and Middle Eastern countries; iron-deficiency anaemia in Somalia and Venezuela; depression in Uganda; onchoceriasis in Liberia; and other neglected tropical diseases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Interpretation: Ageing of the world's population is increasing the number of people living with sequelae of diseases and injuries. Shifts in the epidemiological profile driven by socioeconomic change also contribute to the continued increase in years lived with disability (YLDs) as well as the rate of increase in YLDs. Despite limitations imposed by gaps in data availability and the variable quality of the data available, the standardised and comprehensive approach of the GBD study provides opportunities to examine broad trends, compare those trends between countries or subnational geographies, benchmark against locations at similar stages of development, and gauge the strength or weakness of the estimates available.","385":"Approximately 70% of the global burden of dengue disease occurs on the Asian continent, where many large urban centres provide optimal environments for sustained endemic transmission and periodic epidemic cycles. Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, is a densely populated megacity with hyperendemic dengue transmission. Characterization of the spatiotemporal distribution of dengue transmission intensity is of key importance for optimal implementation of novel control and prevention programmes, including vaccination. In this paper we use mathematical models to provide the first detailed description of spatial and temporal variability in dengue transmission intensity in Jakarta.While the absolute number of dengue case notifications cannot be relied upon as a measure of endemicity, the age-distribution of reported dengue cases provides valuable insights into the underlying nature of transmission. Our estimates from yearly and average annual case notification data represent the first detailed estimates of dengue transmission intensity in Jakarta's subdistricts. These will be important to consider when assessing the population-level impact and cost-effectiveness of potential control and prevention programmes in Jakarta province, such as the controlled release of Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes and vaccination.We applied catalytic models in a Bayesian framework to age-stratified dengue case notification data to estimate dengue force of infection and reporting probabilities in 42 subdistricts of Jakarta. The model was fitted to yearly and average annual data covering a 10-year period between 2008 and 2017. We estimated a long-term average annual transmission intensity of 0.130 (95%CrI: 0.129-0.131) per year in Jakarta province, ranging from 0.090 (95%CrI: 0.077-0.103) to 0.164 (95%CrI: 0.153-0.174) across subdistricts. Annual average transmission intensity in Jakarta province during the 10-year period ranged from 0.012 (95%CrI: 0.011-0.013) in 2017 to 0.124 (95%CrI: 0.121-0.128) in 2016.","386":"A cohort of Chinese men who were born between 1922 and 1993.Across multiple birth cohorts, middle-aged Chinese men have consistently higher risks of starting and resuming heavy drinking and lower probabilities of quitting their current heavy drinking than men in other age groups. From 1993 to 2011, the risk of starting or resuming heavy drinking continued to decrease over generations. Our model projected that the prevalence of heavy drinking among Chinese men will decrease by 33% (95% CI 11.5% to 54.6%) between 2015 and the end of 2027. Complete elimination of or acceptance of a change in heavy drinking behaviours among Chinese men could accelerate this decrease by 12\u2009percentage points (95%\u2009CI 7.8 to 18.2) and avert 377\u2009000 deaths (95%\u2009CI 228\u2009000 to 577\u2009000) in total from 2015 to 2027.We constructed a Markov cohort model that simulates age-specific heavy drinking behaviours for a series of cohorts of Chinese men born between 1922 and 1993 and fitted the model to longitudinal data on drinking patterns (1993-2015). We projected male prevalence of heavy drinking from 2015 through 2027 with and without modification of heavy drinking behaviours.Outcomes included age-specific and birth cohort-specific rates of initiating, quitting and reinitiating heavy drinking from 1993 through 2011, projected prevalence of heavy drinking from 2015 to 2027, and total reduction in prevalence and total averted deaths with hypothetical elimination of heavy drinking behaviours.To estimate the age patterns and cohort trends in heavy drinking among Chinese men from 1993 to 2011 and to project the future burden of heavy drinking through 2027.Heavy drinking prevalence will continue to decrease through 2027 if current age-specific and birth cohort-specific patterns of starting, quitting and resuming heavy drinking continue. Effective mitigation policy should consider age-specific patterns in heavy drinking behaviours to further reduce the burden of heavy drinking.","387":"Asymptomatic infection occurs for numerous respiratory viral diseases, including influenza and COVID-19. We seek to clarify confusion in three areas: age-specific risks of transmission and\/or disease; various definitions for the COVID-19 \"mortality rate\", each useful for specific purposes; and implications for student return strategies from pre-school through university settings.","388":"We analyzed incidence data for seven groups of respiratory viruses in New York City (NYC) during October 2015 to May 2021 (i.e., before and during the COVID-19 pandemic). We first used elastic net regression to identify potential virus interactions and further examined the robustness of the found interactions by comparing the performance of Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models with and without the interactions. We then used the models to compute counterfactual estimates of cumulative incidence and estimate the reduction during the COVID-19 pandemic period from March 2020 to May 2021, for each virus.Circulation of several respiratory viruses has been low during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may lead to increased population susceptibility. It is thus important to enhance monitoring of these viruses and promptly enact measures to mitigate their health impacts (e.g., influenza vaccination campaign and hospital infection prevention) as societies resume normal activities.We identified potential interactions for three endemic human coronaviruses (CoV-NL63, CoV-HKU, and CoV-OC43), parainfluenza (PIV)-1, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). We found significant reductions (by ~70-90%) in cumulative incidence of CoV-OC43, CoV-229E, human metapneumovirus, PIV-2, PIV-4, RSV, and influenza virus during the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, the circulation of adenovirus and rhinovirus was less affected.Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and voluntary behavioral changes during the COVID-19 pandemic have influenced the circulation of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections. We aimed to examine interactions among common non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory virus and further estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these viruses.","389":"Experimental studies have shown that the size and infectious-stage of viral inoculum influence disease outcomes in rhesus macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus. The possible contribution to disease outcome of antibody developed after transmission and\/or present in the inoculum in free or bound form is not understood. In this study, we develop a mathematical model of virus-antibody immune complex formation and use it to predict their role in transmission and protection. The model exhibits a bistable switch between clearance and persistence states. We fitted it to temporal virus data and estimated the parameter values for free virus infectivity rate and antibody carrying capacity for which the model transitions between virus clearance and persistence when the initial conditions (in particular the ratio of immune complexes to free virus) vary. We used these results to quantify the minimum virus amount in the inoculum needed to establish persistent infections in the presence and absence of protective antibodies.","390":"Background: CT with CTA is widely used to exclude stroke in patients with dizziness, although MRI has higher sensitivity. Objective: To compare patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with dizziness who undergo CT with CTA alone versus those who undergo MRI in terms of stroke-related management and outcomes. Methods: This retrospective study included 1917 patients (mean age, 59.5 years; 776 men, 1141 women) presenting to the ED with dizziness from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2021. A first propensity score matching analysis incorporated demographic characteristics, past medical history, review of systems, physical examination findings, and symptoms to construct matched groups of patients discharged from the ED after undergoing head CT with head and neck CTA alone and patients who underwent brain MRI (with or without CT and CTA). Outcomes were compared. A second analysis compared matched patients discharged after CT with CTA alone and patients who underwent specialized abbreviated MRI using multiplanar high-resolution DWI for increased sensitivity for posterior circulation stroke. Sensitivity analyses were performed involving MRI examinations performed as the first or only neuroimaging examination, and involving alternative matching and imputation techniques. Results: In the first analysis (407 patients per group), patients who underwent MRI, compared with patients who underwent CT with CTA alone, showed greater frequency of critical neuroimaging results (10.1% vs 4.7%, p=.005), change in secondary stroke prevention medication (9.6% vs 3.2%, p=.001), and subsequent echocardiography evaluation (6.4% vs 1.0%, p<.001). In the second analysis (100 patients per group), patients who underwent specialized abbreviated MRI, compared with patients who underwent CT with CTA alone, showed greater frequency of critical neuroimaging results (10.0% vs 2.0%, p=.04), change in secondary stroke prevention medication (14.0% vs 1.0%, p=.001), and subsequent echocardiography evaluation (12.0% vs 2.0%, p=.01), and lower frequency of 90-day ED readmissions (12.0% vs 28.0%, p=.008). Sensitivity analyses showed qualitatively similar findings. Conclusion: A proportion of patients discharged after CT with CTA alone may have benefitted from alternative or additional evaluation by MRI (including MRI using a specialized abbreviated protocol). Clinical Impact: Use of MRI may motivate clinically impactful management changes in patients presenting with dizziness.","391":" genome, we first analyzed pairwise SNP differences among TB cases from Los Angeles County, California, with strong epidemiologic links. We found that SNP distance alone was insufficient for concluding that cases are linked through recent transmission. Second, we describe a well-characterized cluster of TB cases in California to illustrate the role of genomic data in conclusions regarding recent transmission. Longer presumed latent periods were inconsistently associated with larger SNP differences. Our analyses suggest that WGS alone cannot be used to definitively determine that a case is attributable to recent transmission. Methods for integrating clinical, epidemiologic, and genomic data can guide conclusions regarding the likelihood of recent transmission, providing local public health practitioners with better tools for monitoring and investigating TB transmission.","392":"Computational modelling has become increasingly common in life science research. To provide a platform to support universal sharing, easy accessibility and model reproducibility, BioModels (https:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/biomodels\/), a repository for mathematical models, was established in 2005. The current BioModels platform allows submission of models encoded in diverse modelling formats, including SBML, CellML, PharmML, COMBINE archive, MATLAB, Mathematica, R, Python or C++. The models submitted to BioModels are curated to verify the computational representation of the biological process and the reproducibility of the simulation results in the reference publication. The curation also involves encoding models in standard formats and annotation with controlled vocabularies following MIRIAM (minimal information required in the annotation of biochemical models)\u00a0guidelines. BioModels now accepts large-scale submission of auto-generated computational models. With gradual growth in content over 15 years, BioModels currently hosts about 2000 models from the published literature. With about 800 curated models, BioModels has become the world's largest repository of curated models and emerged as the third most used data resource after PubMed and Google Scholar among the scientists who use modelling in their research. Thus, BioModels benefits modellers by providing access to reliable and semantically enriched curated models in standard formats that are easy to share, reproduce and reuse.","393":"New variants of SARS-CoV-2 show remarkable heterogeneity in their relative fitness both over time and space. In this paper we extend a previously published model for estimating the selection strength for new SARS-CoV-2 variants to a hierarchical, mixed-effects, renewal equation model. This formulation allows us to globally estimate selection effects at different spatial levels while controlling for complex patterns of transmission and jointly inferring the effects of unit-level covariates in the spatial heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 selection effects. Applying this model to the spread of Omicron in 40 counties finding evidence for very strong (64%) but very heterogeneous selection effects at the country level. We further considered different measures of vaccination levels and measures of recent population-level infection as possible explanations. However, none of those variables were found to explain a significant proportion of the heterogeneity in country-level selection effects. We did find a significant positive correlation between the selection advantage of Delta and Omicron at the country level, suggesting that region-specific explanatory variables of fitness differences do exist. Our method is implemented in the Stan programming language, can be run on standard commercial-grade computing resources, and should be straightforward to apply to future variants.","394":"We found that the diets of male and female bees of the same species were often dissimilar as the diets of different species of bees. Furthermore, we demonstrate differences in preference between male and female bees. We show that intraspecific differences in preference can be robustly identified among hundreds of unique species-species interactions, without precisely quantifying resource availability, and despite high phenological turnover of both bees and plant bloom. Given the large differences in both flower use and preferences between male and female bees, ecological sex differences should be integrated into studies of bee demography, plant pollination, and coevolutionary relationships between flowers and insects.Intraspecific variation in foraging niche can drive food web dynamics and ecosystem processes. In particular, male and female animals can exhibit different, often cascading, impacts on their interaction partners. Despite this, studies of plant-pollinator interaction networks have focused on the partitioning of the floral community between pollinator species, with little attention paid to intraspecific variation in plant preference between male and female bees. We designed a field study to evaluate the strength and prevalence of sexually dimorphic foraging, and particularly resource preferences, in bees.We observed bees visiting flowers in semi-natural meadows in New Jersey, USA. To detect differences in flower use against a shared background of resource (flower) availability, we maximized the number of interactions observed within narrow spatio-temporal windows. To distinguish observed differences in bee use of flower species, which can reflect abundance patterns and sampling effects, from underlying differences in bee preferences, we analyzed our data with both a permutation-based null model and random effects models.","395":"Drug overdose deaths continue to increase in the United States for all major drug categories. Over the past two decades the total number of overdose fatalities has increased more than fivefold; since 2013 the surge in overdose rates is primarily driven by fentanyl and methamphetamines. Different drug categories and factors such as age, gender, and ethnicity are associated with different overdose mortality characteristics that may also change in time. For example, the average age at death from a drug overdose has decreased from 1940 to 1990 while the overall mortality rate has steadily increased. To provide insight into the population-level dynamics of drug overdose mortality, we develop an age-structured model for drug addiction. Using an augmented ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), we show through a simple example how our model can be combined with synthetic observation data to estimate mortality rate and an age-distribution parameter. Finally, we use an EnKF to combine our model with observation data on overdose fatalities in the United States from 1999 to 2020 to forecast the evolution of overdose trends and estimate model parameters.","396":"Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.The past two decades have seen expansion of childhood vaccination programmes in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We quantify the health impact of these programmes by estimating the deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted by vaccination against ten pathogens in 98 LMICs between 2000 and 2030.16 independent research groups provided model-based disease burden estimates under a range of vaccination coverage scenarios for ten pathogens: hepatitis B virus, Haemophilus influenzae type B, human papillomavirus, Japanese encephalitis, measles, Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A, Streptococcus pneumoniae, rotavirus, rubella, and yellow fever. Using standardised demographic data and vaccine coverage, the impact of vaccination programmes was determined by comparing model estimates from a no-vaccination counterfactual scenario with those from a reported and projected vaccination scenario. We present deaths and DALYs averted between 2000 and 2030 by calendar year and by annual birth cohort.We estimate that vaccination of the ten selected pathogens will have averted 69 million (95% credible interval 52-88) deaths between 2000 and 2030, of which 37 million (30-48) were averted between 2000 and 2019. From 2000 to 2019, this represents a 45% (36-58) reduction in deaths compared with the counterfactual scenario of no vaccination. Most of this impact is concentrated in a reduction in mortality among children younger than 5 years (57% reduction [52-66]), most notably from measles. Over the lifetime of birth cohorts born between 2000 and 2030, we predict that 120 million (93-150) deaths will be averted by vaccination, of which 58 million (39-76) are due to measles vaccination and 38 million (25-52) are due to hepatitis B vaccination. We estimate that increases in vaccine coverage and introductions of additional vaccines will result in a 72% (59-81) reduction in lifetime mortality in the 2019 birth cohort.Increases in vaccine coverage and the introduction of new vaccines into LMICs have had a major impact in reducing mortality. These public health gains are predicted to increase in coming decades if progress in increasing coverage is sustained.","397":"Further research is needed on the impact of migration on hepatitis A vaccination and vaccination in general. Health managers should be attentive to the different factors affecting vaccination among social strata.Among 31,001 children, hepatitis A coverage was 88.1% (95%CI 86.8;89.2). Regarding socioeconomic strata (A\/B), the variable immigrant parents\/guardians was associated with non-vaccination (PR = 1.91; 95%CI 1.09;3.37); in strata C\/D, children of Asian race\/skin color (PR = 4.69; 95%CI 2.30;9.57), fourth-born child or later (PR = 1.68; 95%CI 1.06;2 .66), not attending daycare\/nursery (PR = 1.67; 95%CI 1.24;2.24) and mother with paid work (PR = 1.42; 95%CI 1.16;1.74) were associated with non-vaccination.Hepatitis A vaccination coverage was 88%. Non-vaccination was greater in children with immigrant guardians (strata A\/B); of Asian race\/skin color, fourth-born child or later, those not attending daycare\/nursery and mother with paid work (C\/D strata).This was a survey involving a sample stratified by socioeconomic strata in capital cities (2020-2022), with coverage estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI), the factor analysis was performed using the prevalence ratio (PR) by means of Poisson regression.Hepatitis A coverage was below the target (95%), suggesting that specificities of social strata should be taken into consideration.The results of this study contributed to the Ministry of Health and Health Departments in monitoring vaccination coverage and identifying factors that may negatively impact hepatitis A vaccination coverage.To estimate hepatitis A vaccination coverage in 24-month-old children and identify factors associated with non-vaccination.","398":" resistance resulted in an enhanced replicative fitness compared to the less resistant starting population.

Decreasing malaria transmission leave VMWs with diminished roles. Activities related to the control of other health conditions could keep these community health workers relevant.During 2022, 120 VMWs attended training at local health centres on four health education packages: 1. hygiene and sanitation; 2. disease surveillance; 3. management of mild illness; 4. vaccination and antenatal care. All training and evaluation sessions were documented through meeting minutes, and 19 focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted among VMWs and health centre personnel. Audio-records of FGDs were transcribed and translated in English and underwent thematic analysis.VMWs reported strong interest in the training and welcomed the expansion of their roles thus assuring their continued relevance. VMWs prioritized disease surveillance and management of mild illness among the available training packages because these topics were seen as most relevant. While training was considered comprehensible and important, the low literacy among VMWs was an impediment suggesting training materials need to be delivered visually. Since VMWs have limited resources, incentives could ensure that VMWs are motivated to undertake additional roles and responsibilities.The transformation of VMWs into community health workers with roles beyond malaria is a promising approach for sustaining health care provision in remote areas. Training needs to consider the low scientific literacy, time constraints and limited resources of VMWs.","400":"In this issue of Cell, Washington et\u00a0al. and Alpert et\u00a0al. demonstrate the value of genomic surveillance when studying the introduction of the B.1.1.7 variant to the US and illustrate the challenge that results from the lack of good sampling strategies.","401":" Sn) intermetallic coating layer (ICL) is rationally designed to stabilize Sn through a structural reconstruction mechanism. The low activity of the Cu-Sn ICL against lithiation\/delithiation enables the gradual separation of the metallic Cu phase from the Cu-Sn ICL, which provides a regulatable and appropriate distribution of Cu to buffer volume change of Sn anode. Concurrently, the homogeneous distribution of the separated Sn together with Cu promotes uniform lithiation\/delithiation, mitigating the internal stress. In addition, the residual rigid Cu-Sn intermetallic shows terrific mechanical integrity that resists the plastic deformation during the lithiation\/delithiation. As a result, the Sn anode enhanced by the Cu-Sn ICL shows a significant improvement in cycling stability with a dramatically reduced capacity decay rate of 0.03% per cycle for 1000 cycles. The structural reconstruction mechanism in this work shines a light on new materials and structural design that can stabilize high-performance and high-volume-change electrodes for rechargeable batteries and beyond.","402":"We estimated the effective reproduction number R e as 1.08 [95% confidence interval ( CI): 0.51, 1.65] in northern China and 1.10 (95% CI: 0.55, 1.67) in southern China at the start of the 2022-2023 influenza season. We estimated the infection attack rate of this influenza wave as 18.51% (95% CI: 0.00%, 37.78%) in northern China and 28.30% (95% CI: 14.77%, 41.82%) in southern China.Using a mathematical model incorporating influenza activity as measured by influenza-like illness (ILI) data for northern and southern regions of China, we reconstructed the seasonal influenza incidence from October 2015 to September 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic. Using this trained model, we predicted influenza activities in northern and southern China from March to September 2023.The 2023 spring wave of seasonal influenza in China spread until July 2023 and infected a substantial number of people.Seasonal influenza resurged in China in February 2023, causing a large number of hospitalizations. While influenza epidemics occurred across China during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the relaxation of COVID-19 containment measures in December 2022 may have contributed to the spread of acute respiratory infections in winter 2022\/2023.","403":"Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) may interact with law enforcement officers (LEOs) as victims of crime, witnesses to crime, or suspects of crime. Interactions between LEOs and those with ASD may go awry which raises questions about levels of training, experiences, and knowledge acquired by LEOs. Seventy-two LEOs reported on their experiences and training related to ASD and completed a survey of autism knowledge. The majority (72.2%) of LEOs reported no formal training for interacting with individuals with ASD. For LEOs responding to calls involving ASD, officers with prior training reported better preparation. Officers' responses to the knowledge survey varied considerably. Results support the need for formalized training in ASD for LEOs.","404":" = 0 is a threshold for disease spread, just like [Formula: see text] [ 1], and show that we can measure the strength and speed of an intervention on the same scale as the strength and speed of an epidemic, respectively. We argue that, while the strength-based paradigm provides the clearest insight into certain questions, the speed-based paradigm provides the clearest view in other cases. As an example, we show that evaluating the prospects of 'test-and-treat' interventions against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be done more clearly on the speed than strength scale, given uncertainty in the proportion of HIV spread that happens early in the course of infection. We also discuss evaluating the effects of the importance of pre-symptomatic transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We suggest that disease modellers should avoid over-emphasizing the reproductive number at the expense of the exponential growth rate, but instead look at these as complementary measures.","405":"Measles is a target for elimination in all six WHO regions by 2020, and over the last decade, there has been considerable progress towards this goal. Surveillance is recognised as a cornerstone of elimination programmes, allowing early identification of outbreaks, thus enabling control and preventing re-emergence. Fever-rash surveillance is increasingly available across WHO regions, and this symptom-based reporting is broadly used for measles surveillance. However, as measles control increases, symptom-based cases are increasingly likely to reflect infection with other diseases with similar symptoms such as rubella, which affects the same populations, and can have a similar seasonality. The WHO recommends that cases from suspected measles outbreaks be laboratory-confirmed, to identify 'true' cases, corresponding to measles IgM titres exceeding a threshold indicative of infection. Although serological testing for IgM has been integrated into the fever-rash surveillance systems in many countries, the logistics of sending in every suspected case are often beyond the health system's capacity. We show how age data from serologically confirmed cases can be leveraged to infer the status of non-tested samples, thus strengthening the information we can extract from symptom-based surveillance. Applying an age-specific confirmation model to data from three countries with divergent epidemiology across Africa, we identify the proportion of cases that need to be serologically tested to achieve target levels of accuracy in estimated infected numbers and discuss how this varies depending on the epidemiological context. Our analysis provides an approach to refining estimates of incidence leveraging all available data, which has the potential to improve allocation of resources, and thus contribute to rapid and efficient control of outbreaks.","406":"Model-based estimates of measles burden and the impact of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) are crucial for global health priority setting. Recently, evidence from systematic reviews and database analyses have improved our understanding of key determinants of MCV impact. We explore how representations of these determinants affect model-based estimation of vaccination impact in ten countries with the highest measles burden.Using Dynamic Measles Immunisation Calculation Engine (DynaMICE), we modelled the effect of evidence updates for five determinants of MCV impact: case-fatality risk, contact patterns, age-dependent vaccine efficacy, the delivery of supplementary immunisation activities (SIAs) to zero-dose children, and the basic reproduction number. We assessed the incremental vaccination impact of the first (MCV1) and second (MCV2) doses of routine immunisation and SIAs, using metrics of total vaccine-averted cases, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) over 2000-2050. We also conducted a scenario capturing the effect of COVID-19 related disruptions on measles burden and vaccination impact.Incorporating updated evidence particularly on vaccine efficacy and case-fatality risk reduces estimates of vaccination impact moderately, but its overall impact remains considerable. High MCV coverage through both routine immunisation and SIAs remains essential for achieving and maintaining low incidence in high measles burden settings.Incorporated with the updated data sources, DynaMICE projected 253 million measles cases, 3.8 million deaths and 233 million DALYs incurred over 2000-2050 in the ten high-burden countries when MCV1, MCV2, and SIA doses were implemented. Compared to no vaccination, MCV1 contributed to 66% reduction in cumulative measles cases, while MCV2 and SIAs reduced this further to 90%. Among the updated determinants, shifting from fixed to linearly-varying vaccine efficacy by age and from static to time-varying case-fatality risks had the biggest effect on MCV impact. While varying the basic reproduction number showed a limited effect, updates on the other four determinants together resulted in an overall reduction of vaccination impact by 0.58%, 26.2%, and 26.7% for cases, deaths, and DALYs averted, respectively. COVID-19 related disruptions to measles vaccination are not likely to change the influence of these determinants on MCV impact, but may lead to a 3% increase in cases over 2000-2050.","407":".

HiFine designs a strategy of fragmentation for the original bin sets derived from the Hi-C-based and shotgun-based binning methods, which considerably increases the purity of initial bins, followed by merging fragmented bins and recruiting unbinned contigs. We demonstrate that HiFine significantly improves the existing binning results of both types of binning methods and achieves better performance in constructing species genomes on publicly available datasets. To the best of our knowledge, HiFine is the first pipeline to integrate different types of tools for the binning of metagenomic contigs.Metagenomic binning aims to retrieve microbial genomes directly from ecosystems by clustering metagenomic contigs assembled from short reads into draft genomic bins. Traditional shotgun-based binning methods depend on the contigs' composition and abundance profiles and are impaired by the paucity of enough samples to construct reliable co-abundance profiles. When applied to a single sample, shotgun-based binning methods struggle to distinguish closely related species only using composition information. As an alternative binning approach, Hi-C-based binning employs metagenomic Hi-C technique to measure the proximity contacts between metagenomic fragments. However, spurious inter-species Hi-C contacts inevitably generated by incorrect ligations of DNA fragments between species link the contigs from varying genomes, weakening the purity of final draft genomic bins. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a binning pipeline to overcome the shortcomings of both types of binning methods on a single sample.","409":"Mistrust is a major barrier to implementing deep learning in healthcare settings. Entrustment could be earned by conveying model certainty, or the probability that a given model output is accurate, but the use of uncertainty estimation for deep learning entrustment is largely unexplored, and there is no consensus regarding optimal methods for quantifying uncertainty. Our purpose is to critically evaluate methods for quantifying uncertainty in deep learning for healthcare applications and propose a conceptual framework for specifying certainty of deep learning predictions. We searched Embase, MEDLINE, and PubMed databases for articles relevant to study objectives, complying with PRISMA guidelines, rated study quality using validated tools, and extracted data according to modified CHARMS criteria. Among 30 included studies, 24 described medical imaging applications. All imaging model architectures used convolutional neural networks or a variation thereof. The predominant method for quantifying uncertainty was Monte Carlo dropout, producing predictions from multiple networks for which different neurons have dropped out and measuring variance across the distribution of resulting predictions. Conformal prediction offered similar strong performance in estimating uncertainty, along with ease of interpretation and application not only to deep learning but also to other machine learning approaches. Among the six articles describing non-imaging applications, model architectures and uncertainty estimation methods were heterogeneous, but predictive performance was generally strong, and uncertainty estimation was effective in comparing modeling methods. Overall, the use of model learning curves to quantify epistemic uncertainty (attributable to model parameters) was sparse. Heterogeneity in reporting methods precluded the performance of a meta-analysis. Uncertainty estimation methods have the potential to identify rare but important misclassifications made by deep learning models and compare modeling methods, which could build patient and clinician trust in deep learning applications in healthcare. Efficient maturation of this field will require standardized guidelines for reporting performance and uncertainty metrics.","410":"Snakebite envenoming is a neglected tropical disease affecting deprived populations, and its burden is underestimated in some regions where patients prefer using traditional medicine, case reporting systems are deficient, or health systems are inaccessible to at-risk populations. Thus, the development of strategies to optimize disease management is a major challenge. We propose a framework that can be used to estimate total snakebite incidence at a fine political scale.First, we generated fine-scale snakebite risk maps based on the distribution of venomous snakes in Colombia. We then used a generalized mixed-effect model that estimates total snakebite incidence based on risk maps, poverty, and travel time to the nearest medical center. Finally, we calibrated our model with snakebite data in Colombia from 2010 to 2019 using the Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo algorithm. Our results suggest that 10.19% of total snakebite cases (532.26 yearly envenomings) are not reported and these snakebite victims do not seek medical attention, and that populations in the Orinoco and Amazonian regions are the most at-risk and show the highest percentage of underreporting. We also found that variables such as precipitation of the driest month and mean temperature of the warmest quarter influences the suitability of environments for venomous snakes rather than absolute temperature or rainfall.Our framework permits snakebite underreporting to be estimated using data on snakebite incidence and surveillance, presence locations for the most medically significant venomous snake species, and openly available information on population size, poverty, climate, land cover, roads, and the locations of medical centers. Thus, our algorithm could be used in other countries to estimate total snakebite incidence and improve disease management strategies; however, this framework does not serve as a replacement for a surveillance system, which should be made a priority in countries facing similar public health challenges.","411":"We present a novel statistical approach called Dynamic Survival Analysis (DSA) to model an epidemic curve with incomplete data. The DSA approach is advantageous over standard statistical methods primarily because it does not require prior knowledge of the size of the susceptible population, the overall prevalence of the disease, and also the shape of the epidemic curve.The principal motivation behind the study was to obtain predictions of case counts of COVID-19 and the resulting hospital burden in the state of Ohio during the early phase of the pandemic.The proposed methodology was applied to the COVID-19 incidence data in the state of Ohio to support the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) and the Ohio Hospital Association (OHA) with predictions of hospital burden in each of the Hospital Catchment Areas (HCAs) of the state.As the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease started to spread rapidly in the state of Ohio, the Ecology, Epidemiology and Population Health (EEPH) program within the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI) at the Ohio State University (OSU) took the initiative to offer epidemic modeling and decision analytics support to the Ohio Department of Health (ODH). This paper describes the methodology used by the OSU\/IDI response modeling team to predict statewide cases of new infections as well as potential hospital burden in the state. The methodology has two components: 1) A Dynamic Survival Analysis (DSA)-based statistical method to perform parameter inference, statewide prediction and uncertainty quantification. 2) A geographic component that down-projects statewide predicted counts to potential hospital burden across the state. We demonstrate the overall methodology with publicly available data. A Python implementation of the methodology has been made available publicly.","412":"We identified the log-normal as the best-fit model. The estimated median incubation period was 4.6 (95% CI: 3.9-4.9) days, and the 95th percentile was 11.7 (95% CI: 10.2-12.2) days. We found that the incubation period did not differ significantly between males and females (p = 0.42), age groups (p = 0.60), and the two different epidemic periods (p = 0.77).The incubation period of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is estimated to vary by demographic factors and the COVID-19 epidemic periods.We collected COVID-19 patient data from the Korean public health authorities and estimated the incubation period by fitting three different distributions, including log-normal, gamma, and Weibull distributions, after stratification by gender and age groups. To identify any temporal impact on the incubation period, we divided the study period into two different epidemic periods (Period-1: 19 January-19 April 2020 and Period-2: 20 April-16 October 2020), and assessed for any differences.The incubation period of wild type of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the COVID-19 pandemic 2020, in South Korea, does not likely differ by age group, gender and epidemic period.This study examined the incubation period of the wild type of SARS-CoV-2 infections by the different age groups, gender, and epidemic periods in South Korea.","413":") populations in coastal southern California that appear isolated due to major highways and dense urban development. Divergence dates among FIV phylogenetic lineages in several cases reflected historical urban growth and construction of major highways. We found strong FIV phylogeographic structure among three host populations north-west of Los Angeles, largely coincident with host genetic structure. In contrast, relatively little FIV phylogeographic structure existed among two genetically distinct host populations south-east of Los Angeles. Rates of FIV transfer among host populations did not vary significantly, with the lack of phylogenetic structure south-east of Los Angeles unlikely to reflect frequent contemporary transmission among populations. Our results indicate that major barriers to host gene flow can also act as barriers to pathogen spread, suggesting potentially reduced susceptibility of fragmented populations to novel directly transmitted pathogens. Infrequent exchange of FIV among host populations suggests that populations would best be managed as distinct units in the event of a severe disease outbreak. Phylogeographic inference of pathogen transmission is useful for estimating the ability of geographic barriers to constrain disease spread and can provide insights into contemporary and historical drivers of host population connectivity.","414":"The mpox epidemic in the UK began in May 2022, with rates of new cases unexpectedly and rapidly declining during August 2022. Interpreting trends in infection requires disentangling the underlying growth rate of cases from the delay from symptom onset to presenting to healthcare. We developed a nowcasting Bayesian method which incorporates time-varying delays (EpiLine) to quantify the changes in the delay from symptom onset to healthcare presentation and the underlying mpox growth rate over the period May-August 2022 in the UK. We show that the mean delay between symptom onset and healthcare presentation for mpox in the UK decreased from 22 days in early May 2022 to 10 days by early June and 8 days in August 2022. When we account for these dynamic delays, the time-varying growth rate declined gradually and continuously in the UK during the May-August 2022 period. Not accounting for varying time delays would have incorrectly characterised the growth rate by a sharp increase followed by a rapid decline in mpox cases. Our results highlight the importance of correctly quantifying the delay between symptom onset to healthcare presentation when characterising the epidemic growth of mpox in the UK. The gradual reduction in the rate of epidemic spread, which pre-dated the vaccine roll-out, is consistent with gradual risk reduction or acquired immunity amongst the highest risk individuals. Our study highlights the need for public health agencies to record the delays from symptom onset to healthcare presentation early in an outbreak.","415":"Molecular surveillance of viral pathogens and inference of transmission networks from genomic data play an increasingly important role in public health efforts, especially for HIV-1. For many methods, the genetic distance threshold used to connect sequences in the transmission network is a key parameter informing the properties of inferred networks. Using a distance threshold that is too high can result in a network with many spurious links, making it difficult to interpret. Conversely, a distance threshold that is too low can result in a network with too few links, which may not capture key insights into clusters of public health concern. Published research using the HIV-TRACE software package frequently uses the default threshold of 0.015 substitutions\/site for HIV pol gene sequences, but in many cases, investigators heuristically select other threshold parameters to better capture the underlying dynamics of the epidemic they are studying. Here, we present a general heuristic scoring approach for tuning a distance threshold adaptively, which seeks to prevent the formation of giant clusters. We prioritize the ratio of the sizes of the largest and the second largest cluster, maximizing the number of clusters present in the network. We apply our scoring heuristic to outbreaks with different characteristics, such as regional or temporal variability, and demonstrate the utility of using the scoring mechanism's suggested distance threshold to identify clusters exhibiting risk factors that would have otherwise been more difficult to identify. For example, while we found that a 0.015 substitutions\/site distance threshold is typical for US-like epidemics, recent outbreaks like the CRF07_BC subtype among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China have been found to have a lower optimal threshold of 0.005 to better capture the transition from injected drug use (IDU) to MSM as the primary risk factor. Alternatively, in communities surrounding Lake Victoria in Uganda, where there has been sustained hetero-sexual transmission for many years, we found that a larger distance threshold is necessary to capture a more risk factor-diverse population with sparse sampling over a longer period of time. Such identification may allow for more informed intervention action by respective public health officials.","416":"While climate is often presented as a key factor influencing the seasonality of diseases, the importance of anthropogenic factors is less commonly evaluated. Using a combination of methods - wavelet analysis, economic analysis, statistical and disease transmission modelling - we aimed to explore the influence of climatic and economic factors on the seasonality of H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in the domestic poultry population of Vietnam. We found that while climatic variables are associated with seasonal variation in the incidence of avian influenza outbreaks in the North of the country, this is not the case in the Centre and the South. In contrast, temporal patterns of H5N1 incidence are similar across these 3 regions: periods of high H5N1 incidence coincide with Lunar New Year festival, occurring in January-February, in the 3 climatic regions for 5 out of the 8 study years. Yet, daily poultry meat consumption drastically increases during Lunar New Year festival throughout the country. To meet this rise in demand, poultry production and trade are expected to peak around the festival period, promoting viral spread, which we demonstrated using a stochastic disease transmission model. This study illustrates the way in which economic factors may influence the dynamics of livestock pathogens.","417":"The flocks' environment (contaminated water, feed and residual contamination) is likely to play a more important role in transmission of ARGs to flocks than previously thought. Results highlight intriguing differences in the quantification of ARGs depending on the metric chosen.Flocks received a mean (standard error, SE) animal daily dose (ADD) of 736.7 (83.0) and 52.1 (9.9)\u2005kg in early and late production, respectively. Overall, ARGs\/16S rRNA increased from day-old (mean 1.47; SE 0.10) to mid-production (1.61; SE 0.16), further decreasing in end-production (1.60; SE 0.1) (all P\u200a>\u200a0.05). In mid-production, ARGs\/16S rRNA increased for aminoglycosides, phenicols, sulphonamides and tetracyclines, decreasing for polymyxins \u03b2-lactams and genes that confer resistance to mutiple classes (multi-drug resistance) (MDR). At end-production, aminoglycoside resistance decreased and polymyxin and quinolone resistance increased (all P\u200a\u200a0.05) were computed.AMU data and faecal samples were collected from 83 flocks (25 farms) at day-old, mid- and late-production (\u223c4\u2005month cycle). Using high-throughput real-time PCR, samples were investigated for 94 ARGs. ARG copies were related to 16S rRNA and ng of DNA (ngDNA). Impact of AMU and ARGs in day-olds was investigated by mixed-effects models.We investigated longitudinally Vietnamese small-scale chicken flocks in order to characterize changes in antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) content over their life cycle, and the impact of antimicrobial use (AMU) on an intervention consisting of veterinary advice provision.","418":"A total of 7786 participants from 26 urban and 15 rural townships were included.The prevalence of CKD is three times higher in rural versus urban areas. Despite >99% National Health Insurance coverage, disparities in CKD prevalence persist between residential areas. Targeted interventions and further studies are crucial for addressing these disparities and enhancing CKD management across different settings.The incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing owing to the ageing population, resulting in an increased demand for dialysis and kidney transplantation, which can be costly. Current research lacks clarity regarding the relationship between residence setting and CKD prevalence or its related risk factors. This study explored the urban-rural disparities in CKD prevalence and risk factors in Taiwan. Our findings will aid the understanding of the distribution of CKD and the design of more effective prevention programmes.This cross-sectional community-based study used the Renal Value Evaluation Awareness and Lift programme, which involves early screening and health education for CKD diagnosis and treatment. CKD prevalence and risk factors including alcohol consumption, smoking and betel nut chewing were compared between urban and rural areas.Urbanisation levels were determined based on population density, education, age, agricultural population and medical resources.The prevalence of CKD was significantly higher in rural (29.2%) than urban (10.8%) areas, representing a 2.7-fold difference (p<0.0001). Risk factors including diabetes (rural vs urban: 21.7% and 11.0%), hypertension (59.0% vs 39.9%), hyperuricaemia (36.7% vs 18.6%), alcohol consumption (29.0% vs 19.5%), smoking (15.9% vs 12.0%), betel nut chewing (12.6% vs 2.8%) and obesity (33.6% vs 19.4%) were significantly higher (p<0.0001) in rural areas.","419":"Studying the mechanisms underlying the genotype-phenotype association is crucial in genetics. Gene expression studies have deepened our understanding of the genotype \u2192 expression \u2192 phenotype mechanisms. However, traditional expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) methods often overlook the critical role of gene co-expression networks in translating genotype into phenotype. This gap highlights the need for more powerful statistical methods to analyze genotype \u2192 network \u2192 phenotype mechanism. Here, we develop a network-based method, called snQTL, to map quantitative trait loci affecting gene co-expression networks. Our approach tests the association between genotypes and joint differential networks of gene co-expression via a tensor-based spectral statistics, thereby overcoming the ubiquitous multiple testing challenges in existing methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of snQTL in the analysis of three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) data. Compared to conventional methods, our method snQTL uncovers chromosomal regions affecting gene co-expression networks, including one strong candidate gene that would have been missed by traditional eQTL analyses. Our framework suggests the limitation of current approaches and offers a powerful network-based tool for functional loci discoveries.","420":"The differentiation of dengue virus (DENV) infection, a major cause of acute febrile illness in tropical regions, from other etiologies, may help prioritize laboratory testing and limit the inappropriate use of antibiotics. While traditional clinical prediction models focus on individual patient-level parameters, we hypothesize that for infectious diseases, population-level data sources may improve predictive ability. To create a clinical prediction model that integrates patient-extrinsic data for identifying DENV among febrile patients presenting to a hospital in Thailand, we fit random forest classifiers combining clinical data with climate and population-level epidemiologic data. In cross-validation, compared to a parsimonious model with the top clinical predictors, a model with the addition of climate data, reconstructed susceptibility estimates, force of infection estimates, and a recent case clustering metric significantly improved model performance.","421":"An app-based educational outbreak simulator, Operation Outbreak (OO), seeks to engage and educate participants to better respond to outbreaks. Here, we examine the utility of OO for understanding epidemiological dynamics. The OO app enables experience-based learning about outbreaks, spreading a virtual pathogen via Bluetooth among participating smartphones. Deployed at many colleges and in other settings, OO collects anonymized spatiotemporal data, including the time and duration of the contacts among participants of the simulation. We report the distribution, timing, duration, and connectedness of student social contacts at two university deployments and uncover cryptic transmission pathways through individuals' second-degree contacts. We then construct epidemiological models based on the OO-generated contact networks to predict the transmission pathways of hypothetical pathogens with varying reproductive numbers. Finally, we demonstrate that the granularity of OO data enables institutions to mitigate outbreaks by proactively and strategically testing and\/or vaccinating individuals based on individual social interaction levels.","422":"Influenza pandemics are associated with severe morbidity, mortality, and social and economic disruption. Every summer in the United States, youths attending agricultural fairs are exposed to genetically diverse influenza A viruses (IAVs) circulating in exhibition swine, resulting in over 450 lab-confirmed zoonotic infections since 2010. Exhibition swine represent a small, defined population (\u223c1.5% of the U.S. herd), presenting a realistic opportunity to mitigate a pandemic threat by reducing IAV transmission in the animals themselves. Through intensive surveillance and genetic sequencing of IAVs in exhibition swine in six U.S. states in 2018 (n\u2009=\u2009212), we characterized how a heterogeneous circuit of swine shows, comprising fairs with different sizes and geographic coverage, facilitates IAV transmission among exhibition swine and into humans. Specifically, we identified the role of an early-season national show in the propagation and spatial dissemination of a specific virus (H1\u03b4-2) that becomes dominant among exhibition swine and is associated with the majority of zoonotic infections in 2018. These findings suggest that a highly targeted mitigation strategy, such as postponing swine shows for 1 to 2\u2009weeks following the early-season national show, could potentially reduce IAV transmission in exhibition swine and spillover into humans, and this merits further study.IMPORTANCE The varying influenza A virus (IAV) exposure and infection status of individual swine facilitates introduction, transmission, and dissemination of diverse IAVs. Since agricultural fairs bring people into intimate contact with swine, they provide a unique interface for zoonotic transmission of IAV. Understanding the dynamics of IAV transmission through exhibition swine is critical to mitigating the high incidence of variant IAV cases reported in association with agricultural fairs. We used genomic sequences from our exhibition swine surveillance to characterize the hemagglutinin and full genotypic diversity of IAV at early-season shows and the subsequent dissemination through later-season agricultural fairs. We were able to identify a critical time point with important implications for downstream IAV and zoonotic transmission. With improved understanding of evolutionary origins of zoonotic IAV, we can inform public health mitigation strategies to ultimately reduce zoonotic IAV transmission and risk of pandemic IAV emergence.","423":"Participants with estimated duration of HIV-1 infection based on repeated testing were sourced from cohorts in Botswana (n=1944). Full-length HIV genome sequencing was performed from proviral DNA. We optimized a machine learning model to classify infections as 1 year based on viral genetic diversity, demographic and clinical data.These results indicate that recency of HIV-1 infection can be inferred from viral sequence diversity even among patients on suppressive ART.HIV-1 genetic diversity increases during infection and can help infer the time elapsed since infection. However the effect of antiretroviral treatment (ART) on the inference remains unknown.The best predictive model included variables for genetic diversity of HIV-1 gag, pol and env, viral load, age, sex and ART status. Most participants were on ART. Balanced accuracy was 90.6% (95%CI:86.7%-94.1%). We tested the algorithm among newly diagnosed participants with or without documented negative HIV tests. Among those without records, those who self-reported a negative HIV test within 1 year previously. There was no difference in classification between those self-reporting a negative HIV test <1 year, whether or not they had a record.","424":"Sexual dimorphism is a ubiquitous source of within-species variation, yet the community-level consequences of sex differences remain poorly understood. Here, we analyze a bitrophic model of two competing resource species and a sexually-reproducing consumer species. We show that consumer sex differences in resource acquisition can have striking consequences for consumer-resource coexistence, abundance, and dynamics. Under both direct interspecific competition and apparent competition between two resource species, sexual dimorphism in consumers' attack rates can mediate coexistence of the resource species, while in other cases can lead to exclusion when stable coexistence is typically expected. Slight sex differences in total resource acquisition also can reverse competitive outcomes and lead to density cycles. These effects are expected whenever both consumer sexes require different amounts or types of resources to reproduce. Our results suggest that consumer sexual dimorphism, which is common, has wide-reaching implications for the assembly and dynamics of natural communities.","425":"COMES-F is the first French large-scale population survey, carried out over 3 different periods (February-March, April, April-May) with some participants common to the first and the last period. Participants described their contacts for 2 consecutive days, and reported separately on professional contacts when typically over 20 per day.Despite no clear evidence for temporal variation, trends suggest that more studies are needed. Age and gender were found important determinants of the mixing patterns. Gender differences in mixing patterns might help explain gender differences in the epidemiology of infectious diseases.Empirical social contact patterns are essential to understand the spread of infectious diseases. To date, no such data existed for France. Although infectious diseases are frequently seasonal, the temporal variation of contact patterns has not been documented hitherto.2033 participants reported 38 881 contacts (weighted median [first quartile-third quartile]: 8[5-14] per day), and 54 378 contacts with supplementary professional contacts (9[5-17]). Contrary to age, gender, household size, holidays, weekend and occupation, period of the year had little influence on the number of contacts or the mixing patterns. Contact patterns were highly assortative with age, irrespective of the location of the contact, and gender, with women having 8% more contacts than men. Although most contacts occurred at home and at school, the inclusion of professional contacts modified the structure of the mixing patterns. Holidays and weekends reduced dramatically the number of contacts, and as proxies for school closure, reduced R0 by 33% and 28%, respectively. Thus, school closures could have an important impact on the spread of close contact infections in France.","426":"Aim\r\nTo determine factors associated with a serious outcome (hospital admission or severe outcome: critical care or death) and associated with illness caused by laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza, with a specific interest in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries (LMIC).\r\n\r\nMethod\r\nDatabases were searched on 11 March 2016 for reports of influenza and factors associated with mortality or morbidity in humans, with no language restrictions. Pooled risks were estimated using random\u2010effects models.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nDespite the heterogeneity of results across studies, known risk factors for serious disease were associated with both hospital admission and severe outcomes (critical care and\/or death). In LMIC, but not in high income countries (HIC), pregnant women, people with HIV\/AIDS and children < 5 years old (compared with older children) were at increased risk of a severe outcome. Also, although all patients with neurological conditions were at higher risk of severe outcomes than those without, children were at higher risk than adults and children who lived in a LMIC were at significantly higher risk than those living in HIC. Adults were more likely than children to suffer a severe outcome if they had diabetes or a hematologic condition, were obese or had liver disease. Asthma is a risk factor for hospital admission but not for severe outcomes.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nKnown risk factors for serious disease remain important predictors of hospital admission and severe outcomes with few differences between HIC and LMIC countries. These differences likely reflect differences in health\u2010seeking behaviours and health services, but high heterogeneity between studies limits conclusions about the effect size.","427":"SignificanceWe resolve conflicting results regarding mask wearing against COVID-19. Most previous work focused on mask mandates; we study the effect of mask wearing directly. We find that population mask wearing notably reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission (mean mask-wearing levels corresponding to a 19% decrease in R). We use the largest wearing survey (n = 20 million) and obtain our estimates from regions across six continents. We account for nonpharmaceutical interventions and time spent in public, and quantify our uncertainty. Factors additional to mask mandates influenced the worldwide early uptake of mask wearing. Our analysis goes further than past work in the quality of wearing data-100 times the size with random sampling-geographical scope, a semimechanistic infection model, and the validation of our results.","428":"Astroviruses are a global cause of pediatric diarrhea, but they are largely understudied, and it is unclear how and where they replicate in the gut. Using an in vivo model, here we report that murine astrovirus preferentially infects actively secreting small intestinal goblet cells, specialized epithelial cells that maintain the mucus barrier. Consequently, virus infection alters mucus production, leading to an increase in mucus-associated bacteria and resistance to enteropathogenic E. coli colonization. These studies establish the main target cell type and region of the gut for productive murine astrovirus infection. They further define a mechanism by which an enteric virus can regulate the mucus barrier, induce functional changes to commensal microbial communities, and alter host susceptibility to pathogenic bacteria.","429":"Influenza leads to regular losses of lives annually and requires careful monitoring and control by health organizations. Annual influenza forecasts help policymakers implement effective countermeasures to control both seasonal and pandemic outbreaks. Existing forecasting techniques suffer from problems such as poor forecasting performance, lack of modeling flexibility, data sparsity, and\/or lack of intepretability. We propose EpiDeep, a novel deep neural network approach for epidemic forecasting which tackles all of these issues by learning meaningful representations of incidence curves in a continuous feature space and accurately predicting future incidences, peak intensity, peak time, and onset of the upcoming season. We present extensive experiments on forecasting ILI (influenza-like illnesses) in the United States, leveraging multiple metrics to quantify success. Our results demonstrate that EpiDeep is successful at learning meaningful embeddings and, more importantly, that these embeddings evolve as the season progresses. Furthermore, our approach outperforms non-trivial baselines by up to 40%.","430":"Measuring gene flow between malaria parasite populations in different geographic locations can provide strategic information for malaria control interventions. Multiple important questions pertaining to the design of such studies remain unanswered, limiting efforts to operationalize genomic surveillance tools for routine public health use. This report examines the use of population-level summaries of genetic divergence (FST) and relatedness (identity-by-descent) to distinguish levels of gene flow between malaria populations, focused on field-relevant questions about data size, sampling, and interpretability of observations from genomic surveillance studies. To do this, we use P. falciparum whole genome sequence data and simulated sequence data approximating malaria populations evolving under different current and historical epidemiological conditions. We employ mobile-phone associated mobility data to estimate parasite migration rates over different spatial scales and use this to inform our analysis. This analysis underscores the complementary nature of divergence- and relatedness-based metrics for distinguishing gene flow over different temporal and spatial scales and characterizes the data requirements for using these metrics in different contexts. Our results have implications for the design and implementation of malaria genomic surveillance studies.","431":" rate for simultaneous triple mutations. Plateau-crossing is fastest for very large populations. At intermediate population sizes, recombination can greatly accelerate adaptation by combining independent mutant lineages to form triple-mutants. For more frequent recombination, such that the population is kept near linkage equilibrium, we extend our analysis to find simple expressions for the expected time to cross plateaus of arbitrary width.","432":"A prospective cohort study of participants drawn from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally representative sample of US adults, with mean (SD) follow-up of 9.1 (3.1) years. In total, 19\u202f887 participants who had their cognitive functions measured in the HRS starting in 1996 through 2008 and who had participated in at least 3 biennial surveys were included. The data analysis was conducted from June to November 2019.Trajectories and annual rates of change for the cognitive domains of mental status, word recall, and vocabulary and for the total cognitive score, which was the sum of the mental status and word recall scores. Participants were clustered into 2 cognitive function trajectories for each cognition measure assessed based on their scores at baseline and through at least 3 biennial surveys: a consistently low trajectory (representing low cognitive scores throughout the study period) and a consistently high trajectory (representing high cognitive scores throughout the study period).To investigate whether associations exist between low to moderate alcohol drinking and cognitive function trajectories or rates of change in cognitive function from middle age to older age among US adults.Alcohol consumption and aging.Studies examining the association of low to moderate drinking with various cognitive functions have yielded mixed findings.These findings suggested that low to moderate alcohol drinking was associated with better global cognition scores, and these associations appeared stronger for white participants than for black participants. Studies examining the mechanisms underlying the association between alcohol drinking and cognition in middle-aged or older adults are needed.The mean (SD) age of 19\u202f887 participants was 61.8 (10.2) years, and the majority of the HRS participants were women (11\u202f943 [60.1%]) and of white race\/ethnicity (16\u202f950 [85.2%]). Low to moderate drinking (<8 drinks per week for women and <15 drinks per week for men) was significantly associated with a consistently high cognitive function trajectory and a lower rate of cognitive decline. Compared with never drinkers, low to moderate drinkers were less likely to have a consistently low trajectory for total cognitive function (odds ratio [OR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.59-0.74), mental status (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.63-0.81), word recall (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.69-0.80), and vocabulary (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.56-0.74) (all P\u2009<\u2009.001). In addition, low to moderate drinking was associated with decreased annual rates of total cognitive function decline (\u03b2 coefficient, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.02-0.07; P\u2009=\u2009.002), mental status (\u03b2 coefficient, 0.02; 95% CI, 0.01-0.03; P\u2009=\u2009.002), word recall (\u03b2 coefficient, 0.02; 95% CI, 0.01-0.04; P\u2009=\u2009.01), and vocabulary (\u03b2 coefficient, 0.01; 95% CI, 0.00-0.03; P\u2009=\u2009.08). A significant racial\/ethnic difference was observed for trajectories of mental status (P\u2009=\u2009.02 for interaction), in which low to moderate drinking was associated with lower odds of having a consistently low trajectory for white participants (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.56-0.75) but not for black participants (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.74-1.39). Finally, the dosage of alcohol consumed had a U-shaped association with all cognitive function domains for all participants, with an optimal dose of 10 to 14 drinks per week.","433":"The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual survey designed to identify trends in the public's health. In its 2019 field survey, the U.S. state of GA tested a new 3 - item module to measure the numbers of bereaved, resident adults aged 18\u00a0years and older. Participants were eligible if they answered 'Yes' to the item 'Have you experienced the death of a family member or close friend in the years 2018 or 2019?'. This analysis explores two research questions. Can estimates for bereavement prevalence be derived without large sampling errors, low precision, and small subsamples? Can multiple imputation techniques be applied to overcome non-response and missing data to support multivariate modeling?BRFSS is a non-institutionalized sample of adults aged 18\u00a0years and older living in the U.S. state of Georgia. Analyses in this study were conducted under two scenarios. Scenario 1 applies the complex sample weights created by the Centers for Disease Control and imputes values for missing responses. Scenario 2 treats the data as a panel - no weighting combined with removal of persons with missing data. Scenario 1 reflects the use of BRFSS data for public health and policy, while Scenario 2 reflects data as it is commonly used in social science research studies.The bereavement screening item has a response rate (RR) of 69.1% (5206 of 7534 persons). Demographic subgroups and categories of health have RR of 55% or more. Under Scenario 1, the estimated prevalence of bereavement is 45.38%, meaning that 3,739,120 adults reported bereaved in 2018 or 2019. The estimated prevalence is 46.02% with Scenario 2 which removes persons with any missing data (4,289 persons). Scenario 2 overestimates the bereavement prevalence by 1.39%. An illustrative logistic model is presented to show the performance of exposure to bereavement under the two data scenarios.Recent bereavement can be ascertained in a surveillance survey accounting for biases in response. Estimating bereavement prevalence is needed for measuring population health. This survey is limited to one US state in a single year and excludes persons aged 17\u00a0years and younger.","434":"Malaria remains at the forefront of scientific research and global political and funding agendas. Previous malaria models of mass-interventions have consistently oversimplified how mass interventions are implemented. We present an individual based, spatially explicit model of malaria transmission that includes all the programmatic implementation details of mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns. We uncover how the impact of MDA campaigns is determined by the interaction between implementation logistics, patterns of human mobility and how transmission risk is distributed over space. This translates into a higher likelihood of malaria elimination for areas with true prevalence under 3% with a faster implementation, in highly mobile populations. If populations are more static, deploying less interventions teams would be cost optimal and predicted to be as impactful. We conclude that mass drug interventions can be an invaluable tool towards malaria elimination in the right context, specifically when paired with effective vector control.","435":"Vaccination in populations can have several kinds of effects. Establishing that vaccination produces population-level effects beyond the direct effects in the vaccinated individuals can have important consequences for public health policy. Formal methods have been developed for study designs and analysis that can estimate the different effects of vaccination. However, implementing field studies to evaluate the different effects of vaccination can be expensive, of limited generalizability, or unethical. It would be advantageous to use routinely collected data to estimate the different effects of vaccination. We consider how different types of data are needed to estimate different effects of vaccination. The examples include rotavirus vaccination of young children, influenza vaccination of elderly adults, and a targeted influenza vaccination campaign in schools. Directions for future research are discussed.

Vaccine effectiveness was 40% (95% confidence interval [CI], 32% to 46%) against any influenza virus, 33% (95% CI, 23% to 41%) against influenza A(H3N2) viruses, and 53% (95% CI, 43% to 61%) against influenza B viruses.The 2016-2017 influenza vaccines provided moderate protection against any influenza among outpatients but were less protective against influenza A(H3N2) viruses than B viruses. Approaches to improving effectiveness against A(H3N2) viruses are needed.In recent influenza seasons, the effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccines against circulating A(H3N2) virus has been lower than against A(H1N1)pdm09 and B viruses, even when circulating viruses remained antigenically similar to vaccine components.","437":"Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) challenge of rhesus macaques (RMs) vaccinated with strain 68-1 Rhesus Cytomegalovirus (RhCMV) vectors expressing SIV proteins (RhCMV\/SIV) results in a binary outcome: stringent control and subsequent clearance of highly pathogenic SIV in ~55% of vaccinated RMs with no protection in the remaining 45%. Although previous work indicates that unconventionally restricted, SIV-specific, effector-memory (EM)-biased CD8+ T cell responses are necessary for efficacy, the magnitude of these responses does not predict efficacy, and the basis of protection vs. non-protection in 68-1 RhCMV\/SIV vector-vaccinated RMs has not been elucidated. Here, we report that 68-1 RhCMV\/SIV vector administration strikingly alters the whole blood transcriptome of vaccinated RMs, with the sustained induction of specific immune-related pathways, including immune cell, toll-like receptor (TLR), inflammasome\/cell death, and interleukin-15 (IL-15) signaling, significantly correlating with subsequent vaccine efficacy. Treatment of a separate RM cohort with IL-15 confirmed the central involvement of this cytokine in the protection signature, linking the major innate and adaptive immune gene expression networks that correlate with RhCMV\/SIV vaccine efficacy. This change-from-baseline IL-15 response signature was also demonstrated to significantly correlate with vaccine efficacy in an independent validation cohort of vaccinated and challenged RMs. The differential IL-15 gene set response to vaccination strongly correlated with the pre-vaccination activity of this pathway, with reduced baseline expression of IL-15 response genes significantly correlating with higher vaccine-induced induction of IL-15 signaling and subsequent vaccine protection, suggesting that a robust de novo vaccine-induced IL-15 signaling response is needed to program vaccine efficacy. Thus, the RhCMV\/SIV vaccine imparts a coordinated and persistent induction of innate and adaptive immune pathways featuring IL-15, a known regulator of CD8+ T cell function, that support the ability of vaccine-elicited unconventionally restricted CD8+ T cells to mediate protection against SIV challenge.","438":"Pneumococcal vaccination policy for US adults is evolving, but previous research has shown that programs to increase vaccine uptake are economically favorable, despite parameter uncertainty. Using value of information (VOI) analysis and prior analyses, we examine the value of further research on vaccine uptake program parameters.In US 50-64-year-olds, current vaccine recommendations with and without an uptake program were analyzed. In older adults, current recommendations and an alternative strategy (polysaccharide vaccine for all, adding conjugate vaccine only for the immunocompromised) with and without uptake programs were examined. Uptake program parameters were derived from a clinical trial (absolute uptake increase 12.3% [range 0-25%], per-person cost $1.78 [range $0.70-$2.26]), with other parameters obtained from US databases. VOI analyses incorporated probabilistic sensitivity analysis outputs into R-based regression techniques.In 50-64-year-olds, an uptake program cost $54,900\/QALY gained compared to no uptake program. For ages \u226565, the program cost $287,000\/QALY gained with the alternative strategy and $765,000\/QALY with current recommendations. In younger adults, population-level expected value of perfect information (EVPI) was $59.7 million at $50,000\/QALY gained and $2.8 million at $100,000\/QALY gained. In older adults, EVPI values ranged from ~$1 million to $34.5 million at $100,000 and $200,000\/QALY thresholds. The population expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI) for combined uptake program cost and uptake improvement parameters in the younger population was $368,700 at $50,000\/QALY and $43,900 at $100,000\/QALY gained thresholds. In older adults, population EVPPI for vaccine uptake program parameters was $0 at both thresholds, reaching a maximum value of $445,000 at a $225,000\/QALY threshold. Other model parameters comprised larger components of the global EVPI.VOI results do not support further research on pneumococcal vaccine uptake programs in adults at commonly cited US cost-effectiveness benchmarks. Further research to reduce uncertainty in other aspects of adult pneumococcal vaccination is justifiable.","439":"We performed RNA-Seq on RNA extracted from matched BAL and PBMC samples isolated from 89 subjects enrolled in the Genomic Research in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency and Sarcoidosis (GRADS) study. Subjects were stratified by genotype and augmentation therapy. Supervised and unsupervised differential gene expression analyses were performed using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify gene profiles associated with subjects' clinical variables. The genes in the most significant WGCNA module were used to cluster AATD individuals. Gene validation was performed by NanoString nCounter Gene Expression Assay.Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic condition that causes early onset pulmonary emphysema and airways obstruction. The complete mechanisms via which AATD causes lung disease are not fully understood. To improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of AATD, we investigated gene expression profiles of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in AATD individuals.We successfully identified novel clusters of AATD individuals where severity correlated with increased immune response independent of individuals' genotype and augmentation therapy. These findings may suggest the presence of previously unrecognised disease endotypes in AATD that associate with T-lymphocyte immunity and disease severity.We observed modest effects of AATD genotype and augmentation therapy on gene expression. When WGCNA was applied to BAL transcriptome, one gene module, ME31 (2312 genes), correlated with the highest number of clinical variables and was functionally enriched with numerous immune T-lymphocyte related pathways. This gene module identified two distinct clusters of AATD individuals with different disease severity and distinct PBMC gene expression patterns.","440":" wave. Luckily, we now have several safe and effective vaccines.

A permanent reopening of society highly depends on winning that race.","441":"Using data from New York City from January to April 2020, we found that there was an estimated 28-day lag between the onset of reduced subway use and the end of the exponential growth period of SARS-CoV-2 within New York City boroughs. We also conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the associations between human mobility (i.e., subway ridership) on the week of April 11, 2020, sociodemographic factors, and COVID-19 incidence as of April 26, 2020. Areas with lower median income, a greater percentage of individuals who identify as non-white and\/or Hispanic\/Latino, a greater percentage of essential workers, and a greater percentage of healthcare essential workers had greater mobility during the pandemic. When adjusted for the percent of essential workers, these associations do not remain, suggesting essential work drives human movement in these areas. Increased mobility and all sociodemographic variables (except percent older than 75 years old and percent of healthcare essential workers) was associated with a higher rate of COVID-19 cases per 100k, when adjusted for testing effort. Our study demonstrates that the most socially disadvantaged are not only at an increased risk for COVID-19 infection, but lack the privilege to fully engage in social distancing interventions.","442":"The analysis of viral kinetics models is mostly achieved by numerical methods.

We utilize our solution to interpret the effect of varying IFN efficacy, suggesting a competition between virions and interferon that can cause an additional peak in the usually exponential increase in the viral load.","443":"Typhoid conjugate vaccines are available in the private market in India and are also recommended by the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) for inclusion in India's Universal Immunisation Programme in 2022 to control and prevent typhoid fever. Our study aims to synthesise the supportive evidence for typhoid conjugate vaccine implementation in the routine immunisation programme of India.We conducted a literature review to identify supportive evidence for typhoid conjugate vaccine implementation in India based on the key criteria of the World Health Organisation's Evidence-to-Recommendation framework for National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups.We synthesised evidence on typhoid disease burden, benefits and harms of typhoid conjugate vaccine, cost-effectiveness analysis, and implementation feasibility. However, the in-country evidence on budget impact analysis, vaccine demand and supply forecast, equity analysis, target population values and preferences, immunisation service providers' acceptability, co-administration safety, and antimicrobial resistance tracking were limited.Based on the literature review, we identified evidence gaps. We recommend identifying research priorities for supporting typhoid conjugate vaccine implementation decision-making in India by combining evidence gaps with the perceived importance of the same evidence criteria and factors among immunisation stakeholders.","444":"The RNA interference (RNAi) drug ARC-520 was shown to be effective in reducing serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in HBeAg-positive patients treated with a single dose of ARC-520 and daily nucleosidic analogue (entecavir). To provide insights into HBV dynamics under ARC-520 treatment and its efficacy in blocking HBV DNA, HBsAg, and HBeAg production we developed a multi-compartmental pharmacokinetic-pharamacodynamic model and calibrated it with frequent measured HBV kinetic data. We showed that the time-dependent single dose ARC-520 efficacies in blocking HBsAg and HBeAg are more than 96% effective around day 1, and slowly wane to 50% in 1-4 months. The combined single dose ARC-520 and entecavir effect on HBV DNA was constant over time, with efficacy of more than 99.8%. The observed continuous HBV DNA decline is entecavir mediated, the strong but transient HBsAg and HBeAg decays are ARC-520 mediated. The modeling framework may help assess ongoing RNAi drug development for hepatitis B virus infection.","445":"Patients admitted between February 2013 and May 2017 at a tertiary center that received REBOA were included. Patients in cardiac arrest before or at the time of REBOA were excluded. Time of AO was documented by time-stamped videography and correlated with CVS data.28 patients were included, mean (standard deviation) ISS was 38 (11). 18 received Zone 1 (distal thoracic aorta) and 10 received Zone 3 (distal abdominal aorta) AO. Among Zone 1 patients the pre-AO systolic blood pressure (SBP) nadir was 64 (19) mmHg, which increased to a mean of 124 (29) mmHg within 5\u2009min after AO (p\u2009<\u20090.01).

The overall mean decrease in SBP after balloon deflation was 13 (20) mmHg (p\u2009<\u20090.01), with similar decreases among groups (14 (21) mmHg vs 12 (18) mmHg for Zone 1 and 3 patients, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.85)). Patients undergoing Zone 1 AO were more likely to have an acute change (increase or decrease) in their heart rate immediately after AO as compared to Zone 3 AO (p\u2009=\u20090.048).Significant hemodynamic alterations occur before, during, and after AO. The effects of Zone 1 AO on blood pressure and heart rate appear different than Zone 3 AO. This may have important implications for cardiac or cerebral function and perfusion goals, particularly with concomitant injuries such as cardiac contusion or traumatic brain injury.The objective of this study was to investigate the hemodynamic effects of aortic occlusion (AO) during Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) using a sophisticated continuous vital sign (CVS) monitoring tool.","446":") but not in the rest of breast cancer subtypes.","447":"Artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) are highly effective at treating uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria, but the emergence of the new pfkelch13 R561H mutation in Rwanda, associated with delayed parasite clearance, suggests that interventions are needed to slow its spread. Using a Rwanda-specific spatial calibration of an individual-based malaria model, we evaluate 26 strategies aimed at minimizing treatment failures and delaying the spread of R561H after 3, 5 and 10\u2009years. Lengthening ACT courses and deploying multiple first-line therapies (MFTs) reduced treatment failures after 5\u2009years when compared to the current approach of a 3-d course of artemether-lumefantrine. The best among these options (an MFT policy) resulted in median treatment failure counts that were 49% lower and a median R561H allele frequency that was 0.15 lower than under baseline. New approaches to resistance management, such as triple ACTs or sequential courses of two different ACTs, were projected to have a larger impact than longer ACT courses or MFT; these were associated with median treatment failure counts in 5\u2009years that were 81-92% lower than the current approach. A policy response to currently circulating artemisinin-resistant genotypes in Africa is urgently needed to prevent a population-wide rise in treatment failures.","448":"To propose a novel framework for COVID-19 vaccine allocation based on three components of Vulnerability, Vaccination, and Values (3Vs).A novel approach is introduced including (I) Vulnerability data collection (including country-specific data on demographic, socioeconomic, epidemiological, healthcare, and environmental factors), (II) Vaccination prioritization through estimation of a unique Vulnerability Index composed of a range of factors selected and weighed through an Artificial Intelligence (AI-enabled) expert elicitation survey and scientific literature screening, and (III) Values consideration by identification of the most effective GIS-assisted allocation of vaccines at the local level, considering context-specific constraints and objectives.We showcase the performance of the 3Vs strategy by comparing it to the actual vaccination rollout in Kenya. We show that under the current strategy, socially vulnerable individuals comprise only 45% of all vaccinated people in Kenya while if the 3Vs strategy was implemented, this group would be the first to receive vaccines.A combination of geospatial data analysis and artificial intelligence methods for evaluating vulnerability factors at the local level and allocate vaccines according to a dynamic mechanism for updating vulnerability and vaccine uptake.","449":"The human papillomavirus (HPV) carries a significant health risk for people with a cervix. Among transgender and nonbinary people, however, testing and treatment for HPV can pose difficulties, and even be traumatic at times. This current study is part of a larger mixed methods study conducted in Michigan in 2020, and it explores the experiences of transmasculine and nonbinary people with at-home self-swabbing HPV test kits and knowledge of HPV transmission\/screenings. Phenomenological methods were used by conducting virtual qualitative interviews with ten transmasculine and nonbinary individuals with cervixes, ages 23-59. Interviews were independently coded by members of the research team and a tabletop theming method was used. Four themes were generated from the data: 1) Multilevel barriers; 2) \"Get it done, so I know that I am safe\"; 3) Contrasting preferences for care; and 4) Community calls for change. The discussion focuses on the implications of these findings for improving sexual health care for the transgender and nonbinary community, along with directions for further research.","450":"We survey 62 users of a university asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 testing service on details of their activities, protective behaviours and contacts in the 7 days prior to receiving a positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result in the period October 2020-March 2021. The resulting data set is novel in capturing very detailed social contact history linked to asymptomatic disease status during a period of significant restriction on social activities. We use this data to explore 3 questions: (i) Did participation in university activities enhance infection risk? (ii) How do contact definitions rank in their ability to explain test outcome during periods of social restrictions? (iii) Do patterns in the protective behaviours help explain discrepancies between the explanatory performance of different contact measures? We classify activities into settings and use Bayesian logistic regression to model test outcome, computing posterior model probabilities to compare the performance of models adopting different contact definitions. Associations between protective behaviours, participant characteristics and setting are explored at the level of individual activities using multiple correspondence analysis (MCA). We find that participation in air travel or non-university work activities was associated with a positive asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, in contrast to participation in research and teaching settings. Intriguingly, logistic regression models with binary measures of contact in a setting performed better than more traditional contact numbers or person contact hours (PCH). The MCA indicates that patterns of protective behaviours vary between setting, in a manner which may help explain the preference for any participation as a contact measure. We conclude that linked PCR testing and social contact data can in principle be used to test the utility of contact definitions, and the investigation of contact definitions in larger linked studies is warranted to ensure contact data can capture environmental and social factors influencing transmission risk.","451":"We examine trends in the prevalence of non-B.1.1.7 lineages in London and other English regions using passive-case detection PCR data, cross-sectional community infection surveys, genomic surveillance, and wastewater monitoring. The study period spans from 31st January 2021 to 15th May 2021.Across data sources, the percentage of non-B.1.1.7 variants has been increasing since late March 2021. This increase was initially driven by a variety of lineages with immune escape. From mid-April, B.1.617.2 (WHO label Delta) spread rapidly, becoming the dominant variant in England by late May.Since its emergence in Autumn 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 (WHO label Alpha) rapidly became the dominant lineage across much of Europe. Simultaneously, several other VOCs were identified globally. Unlike B.1.1.7, some of these VOCs possess mutations thought to confer partial immune escape. Understanding when and how these additional VOCs pose a threat in settings where B.1.1.7 is currently dominant is vital.The outcome of competition between variants depends on a wide range of factors such as intrinsic transmissibility, evasion of prior immunity, demographic specificities and interactions with non-pharmaceutical interventions. The presence and rise of non-B.1.1.7 variants in March likely was driven by importations and some community transmission. There was competition between non-B.1.17 variants which resulted in B.1.617.2 becoming dominant in April and May with considerable community transmission. Our results underscore that early detection of new variants requires a diverse array of data sources in community surveillance.

Low size estimates may contribute to official denial of the existence of MSM; to failure to adequately address their needs; and to inflated HIV service coverage reports that paint a false picture of success. To enable and measure progress in the HIV response, UN agencies should lead a collaborative process to systematically, independently and rigorously gather data on laws and their enforcement.A significantly larger proportion of countries that criminalize same-sex sexual behaviour reported implausibly low size estimates or no size estimates for MSM. This is consistent with findings in qualitative research that MSMs are marginalized and reluctant to be studied in countries where same-sex sexuality is criminalized. Size estimates are often used as the denominators for national HIV service coverage reports. Initially, countries that criminalized same-sex sexuality appeared to have higher HIV testing coverage among MSM than did countries where it is not criminalized. However, investigation of a subset of countries that have reported 90-100% HIV testing coverage among MSM found that most were based on implausibly low or absent size estimates.The study used chi-square tests of independence to explore associations between legal status, key population size estimates, and HIV service coverage for 193 countries from 2007 to 2014. We used data reported by countries on United Nations Global AIDS Progress Report (GARPR) indicators, and legal data from UNAIDS, UNDP, and civil society organizations. Due to lack of sufficiently reliable legal data, only men who have sex with men (MSM) could be studied. The study utilized public data aggregated at the national level.

Proof of compliance is collected with the Schedule H form submitted as part of the annual Internal Revenue Service Form 990 (F990H), including a free-response text section that is known for being ambiguous and difficult to audit. This research is among the first to use natural language processing approaches to evaluate this text section with a focus on health equity and disparities.We used free-response text submitted by hospital reporting entities in Part V and VI of the Internal Revenue Service Form 990 Schedule H between 2010 and 2019. We identified 29 main themes connected to health equity and disparities, and 152 related key phrases. We tallied occurrences of these phrases through term frequency analysis, calculated the Moran I statistic to assess geographic variation in 2018, analyzed Google Trends use for the same terms during the same period, and used semantic search with Sentence-BERT in Python to understand contextual use.We found increased use from 2010 to 2019 across all the 29 phrase themes related to health equity and disparities.

However, use in themes such as LGBTQ, disability, oral health, and race and ethnicity ranked lower than public interest in these topics, and some increased mentions of themes were to explicitly say that no action was taken.Hospital reporting entities demonstrate an increasing awareness of health equity and disparities in community benefit tax documentation, but these do not necessarily correspond with general population interests or additional action. We propose further investigation of alignment with community health needs assessments and make suggestions for improvements to F990H reporting requirements.This study aims to determine the extent to which the free-response text in F990H reveals how nonprofit hospitals address health equity and disparities, including alignment with public priorities.","455":"The study included 33\u202f627 students with a mean (SD) age of 14.8 (1.9) years; 51.3% (18\u202f171) were boys.

Respiratory symptoms were more prevalent in ever exclusive HTP users and ever dual users than ever exclusive cigarette users. These findings suggest that using HTPs instead of cigarettes may not reduce health risks.To investigate the associations of persistent respiratory symptoms with HTP use, cigarette use, and dual use among Hong Kong youth.This was a territorywide cross-sectional school-based survey conducted from October 2018 to July 2019 using an anonymous questionnaire. Schools were randomly invited from a proportionate stratified sample in all 18 districts of Hong Kong. Poisson regression models using generalized estimating equations yielded adjusted prevalence ratios (APRs) of respiratory symptoms in (1) former and current HTP (vs never) users in the whole sample and stratified by cigarette use status and (2) exclusive HTP and dual users vs exclusive cigarette users. Statistical analysis was performed from October 2020 to March 2021.","456":"Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) can spread across health care facilities in a region. Because of limited resources, certain interventions can be implemented in only some facilities; thus, decision-makers need to evaluate which interventions may be best to implement.An agent-based model of health care facilities was developed in 2016 to simulate the spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) for 10 years starting in 2010 and to simulate the use of various MDRO interventions for 3 years starting in 2017. All health care facilities (23 hospitals, 5 long-term acute care hospitals, and 74 nursing homes) serving adult inpatients in Orange County, California, were included, and 42 target facilities were identified via network analyses.Increasing contact precaution effectiveness, increasing interfacility communication about patients' MDRO status, and performing decolonization using antiseptic bathing soap and a nasal product in a specific group of target facilities.To identify a group of target facilities and assess which MDRO intervention would be best to implement in the Shared Healthcare Intervention to Eliminate Life-threatening Dissemination of MDROs in Orange County, a large regional public health collaborative in Orange County, California.The findings of this study highlight the ways in which modeling can inform design of regional interventions and suggested that decolonization would be the best strategy for the Shared Healthcare Intervention to Eliminate Life-threatening Dissemination of MDROs in Orange County.MRSA and CRE prevalence and number of new carriers (ie, transmission events).Compared with continuing infection control measures used in Orange County as of 2017, increasing contact precaution effectiveness from 40% to 64% in 42 target facilities yielded relative reductions of 0.8% (range, 0.5%-1.1%) in MRSA prevalence and 2.4% (range, 0.8%-4.6%) in CRE prevalence in health care facilities countywide after 3 years, averting 761 new MRSA transmission events (95% CI, 756-765 events) and 166 new CRE transmission events (95% CI, 158-174 events). Increasing interfacility communication of patients' MDRO status to 80% in these target facilities produced no changes in the prevalence or transmission of MRDOs. Implementing decolonization procedures (clearance probability: 39% in hospitals, 27% in long-term acute care facilities, and 3% in nursing homes) yielded a relative reduction of 23.7% (range, 23.5%-23.9%) in MRSA prevalence, averting 3515 new transmission events (95% CI, 3509-3521 events). Increasing the effectiveness of antiseptic bathing soap to 48% yielded a relative reduction of 39.9% (range, 38.5%-41.5%) in CRE prevalence, averting 1435 new transmission events (95% CI, 1427-1442 events).","457":"In March\u00a02021, California implemented a vaccine equity policy that prioritized COVID-19 vaccine allocation to communities identified as least advantaged by an area-based socioeconomic measure, the Healthy Places Index. We conducted quasi-experimental and counterfactual analyses to estimate the effect of this policy on COVID-19 vaccination, case, hospitalization, and death rates. Among prioritized communities, vaccination rates increased 28.4\u00a0percent after policy implementation. Furthermore, an estimated 160,892 COVID-19 cases, 10,248 hospitalizations, and 679 deaths in the least-advantaged communities were averted by the policy. Despite these improvements, the share of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in prioritized communities remained elevated. These estimates were robust in sensitivity analyses that tested exchangeability between prioritized communities and those not prioritized by the policy; model specifications; and potential temporal confounders, including prior infections. Correcting for disparities by strategically allocating limited resources to the least-advantaged or most-affected communities can reduce the impacts of COVID-19 and other diseases but might not eliminate health disparities.","458":"Six research directions are outlined for further investigation of LLMs for SHDG: evaluation metrics, LLM adoption, data efficiency, generalization, health equity, and regulatory challenges.Given substantial obstacles surrounding health data acquisition, high-quality synthetic health data are needed to meet a growing demand for the application of advanced analytics for clinical discovery, prediction, and operational excellence. We highlight how recent advances in large language models (LLMs) present new opportunities for progress, as well as new risks, in synthetic health data generation (SHDG).We summarize the current landscape of generative machine learning models (eg, Generative Adversarial Networks) for SHDG, describe remaining challenges and limitations, and identify how recent LLM approaches can potentially help mitigate them.LLMs have already demonstrated both high potential and risks in the health domain, and it is important to study their advantages and disadvantages for SHDG.We synthesized systematic scoping reviews in the SHDG domain, recent LLM methods for SHDG, and papers investigating the capabilities and limits of LLMs.","459":"A combined dataset of 2003 genotypes clustered to 1000 Genomes individuals from Utah with Northern and Western European ancestry (CEU) was used to construct a training set of 790 genotypes paired to 888 RNASeq profiles from temporal cortex (TCX = 248), prefrontal cortex (FP = 50), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG = 41), superior temporal gyrus (STG = 34), parahippocampal cortex (PHG = 34), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC = 461). Following within-tissue normalization and covariate adjustment, predictive weights to impute expression components based on a gene's surrounding cis-variants were trained. The FUSION pipeline was modified to support input of pre-scaled expression values and support cross validation with a repeated measure design arising from the presence of multiple transcriptome samples from the same individual across different tissues.We provide evidence of cis-genetic variation conferring AD risk through 8 genes across six distinct genomic loci. Moreover, we provide expression weights for 6780 genes as a valuable resource to the community, which can be abstracted across the neocortex and a wide range of neuronal phenotypes.Cis-variant architecture alone was informative to train weights and impute expression for 6780 (49.67%) autosomal genes, the majority of which significantly correlated with gene expression; FDR <\u20095%: N = 6775 (99.92%), Bonferroni: N = 6716 (99.06%). Validation of weights in 515 matched genotype to RNASeq profiles from the CommonMind Consortium (CMC) was (72.14%) in DLPFC profiles. Association of imputed expression components from all 2003 genotype profiles yielded 8 genes significantly associated with AD (FDR <\u20090.05): APOC1, EED, CD2AP, CEACAM19, CLPTM1, MTCH2, TREM2, and KNOP1.Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease currently affecting 1.75% of the US population, with projected growth to 3.46% by 2050. Identifying common genetic variants driving differences in transcript expression that confer AD risk is necessary to elucidate AD mechanism and develop therapeutic interventions.

While digital twins have been widely used in engineering for decades, their applications to oncology are only just emerging. Due to advances in experimental techniques quantitatively characterizing cancer, as well as advances in the mathematical and computational sciences, the notion of building and applying digital twins to understand tumor dynamics and personalize the care of cancer patients has been increasingly appreciated. In this review, we present the opportunities and challenges of applying digital twins in clinical oncology, with a particular focus on integrating medical imaging with mechanism-based, tissue-scale mathematical modeling. Specifically, we first introduce the general digital twin framework and then illustrate existing applications of image-guided digital twins in healthcare. Next, we detail both the imaging and modeling techniques that provide practical opportunities to build patient-specific digital twins for oncology. We then describe the current challenges and limitations in developing image-guided, mechanism-based digital twins for oncology along with potential solutions. We conclude by outlining five fundamental questions that can serve as a roadmap when designing and building a practical digital twin for oncology and attempt to provide answers for a specific application to brain cancer. We hope that this contribution provides motivation for the imaging science, oncology, and computational communities to develop practical digital twin technologies to improve the care of patients battling cancer.","461":"If the pandemic can motivate judicious, community-specific implementation of control strategies, global elimination of trachoma as a public health problem could be accelerated.We identify three distinct scenarios for geographic districts depending on whether the basic reproduction number and the treatment-associated reproduction number are above or below a value of 1. We find that when the basic reproduction number is 1, significant delays can occur. In most districts, 1\u00a0y of COVID-related delay can be mitigated by a single extra round of mass drug administration. However, supercritical districts require a new paradigm of infection control because the current strategies will not eliminate disease.Progress towards elimination of trachoma as a public health problem has been substantial, but the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted community-based control efforts.We use a susceptible-infected model to estimate the impact of delayed distribution of azithromycin treatment on the prevalence of active trachoma.","462":"Real-time surveillance of infectious diseases at schools or in communities is often hampered by delays in reporting due to resource limitations and infrastructure issues. By incorporating quantitative PCR and genome sequencing, wastewater surveillance has been an effective complement to public health surveillance at the community and building-scale for pathogens such as poliovirus, SARS-CoV-2, and even the monkeypox virus. In this study, we asked whether wastewater surveillance programs at elementary schools could be leveraged to detect RNA from influenza viruses shed in wastewater. We monitored for influenza A and B viral RNA in wastewater from six elementary schools from January to May 2022. Quantitative PCR led to the identification of influenza A viral RNA at three schools, which coincided with the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and a surge in influenza A infections in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA. We performed genome sequencing of wastewater RNA, leading to the identification of a 2021-2022 vaccine-resistant influenza A (H3N2) 3C.2a1b.2a.2 subclade. We next tested wastewater samples from a treatment plant that serviced the elementary schools, but we were unable to detect the presence of influenza A\/B RNA. Together, our results demonstrate the utility of near-source wastewater surveillance for the detection of local influenza transmission in schools, which has the potential to be investigated further with paired school-level influenza incidence data.","463":"60 million death reports from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) were categorized by age group, sex, race, and cause of death. YLL were calculated using age-specific life expectancies. Age groups were: infants <1, children 1-19, adults 20-64, and older adults 65+.To examine changes in cause-specific Years of Life Lost (YLL) by age, race, and sex group in the USA from 1990 to 2014.Race-based disparities in YLL in the USA since 1990 have narrowed considerably, largely as a result of improvements among blacks compared to whites. Adult white and American Indian \/ Alaskan Native females have experienced worsening YLL, while white males have experienced essentially no change. If recent trajectories continue, adult black\/white disparities in YLL will continue to narrow.Blacks have historically experienced more years of life lost than whites or other racial groups in the USA. In the year 1990 the YLL per 100,000 population was 21,103 for blacks, 14,160 for whites, and 7,417 for others. Between 1990 and 2014 overall YLL in the USA improved by 10%, but with marked variations in the rate of change across age, race, and sex groups. Blacks (all ages, both sexes) showed substantial improvement with a 28% reduction in YLL, compared to whites (all ages, both sexes) who showed a 4% reduction. Among blacks, improvements were seen in all age groups: reductions of 43%, 48%, 28%, and 25% among infants, children, adults, and older adults, respectively. Among whites, reductions of 33%, 44%, and 18% were seen in infants, children, and older adults, but there was a 6% increase in YLL among white adults. YLL increased by 18% in white adult females and declined 1% in white adult males. American Indian\/Alaska Native women also had worsening in YLL, with an 8% increase. Asian Pacific Islanders consistently had the lowest YLL across all ages. Whites had a higher proportion of YLL due to overdose; blacks had a higher proportion due to homicide at younger ages and to heart disease at older ages.","464":" of B.1.1.7 was 6-10% larger than that of B.1.526 in Connecticut in the midst of a COVID-19 vaccination campaign. To assess the generalizability of this framework, we apply it to genomic surveillance data from New York City and observe the same trend. Finally, we use discrete phylogeography to demonstrate that while both variants were introduced into Connecticut at comparable frequencies, clades that resulted from introductions of B.1.1.7 were larger than those resulting from B.1.526 introductions. Our framework, which uses open-source methods requiring minimal computational resources, may be used to monitor near real-time variant dynamics in a myriad of settings.","465":"We analysed 277,555 known SARS-CoV-2 infection records for Ontario, Canada, from 23 January 2020 to 16 February 2021 and estimated the age distributions of hospitalizations, Intensive Care Unit admissions, intubations, and ventilations. We quantified the probability of hospitalization given known SARS-CoV-2 infection, and of survival given COVID-19-related hospitalization.The distribution of hospitalizations peaks with a wide plateau covering ages 60-90, whereas deaths are concentrated in ages 80+. The estimated probability of hospitalization given known infection reaches a maximum of 27.8% at age 80 (95% CI 26.0%-29.7%). The probability of survival given hospitalization is nearly 100% for adults younger than 40, but declines substantially after this age; for example, a hospitalized 54-year-old patient has a 91.7% chance of surviving COVID-19 (95% CI 88.3%-94.4%).Our study demonstrates a significant need for hospitalization in middle-aged individuals and young seniors. This need is not captured by the distribution of deaths, which is heavily concentrated in very old ages. The probability of survival given hospitalization for COVID-19 is lower than is generally perceived for patients over 40. If acute care capacity is exceeded due to an increase in COVID-19 prevalence, the distribution of deaths could expand toward younger ages. These results suggest that vaccine programs should aim to prevent infection not only in old seniors, but also in young seniors and middle-aged individuals, to protect them from serious illness and to limit stress on the healthcare system.Patient age is one of the most salient clinical indicators of risk from COVID-19. Age-specific distributions of known SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related deaths are available for many regions. Less attention has been given to the age distributions of serious medical interventions administered to COVID-19 patients, which could reveal sources of potential pressure on the healthcare system should SARS-CoV-2 prevalence increase, and could inform mass vaccination strategies. The aim of this study is to quantify the relationship between COVID-19 patient age and serious outcomes of the disease, beyond fatalities alone.","466":"Seasonal influenza is controlled through vaccination campaigns. Evolution of influenza virus antigens means that vaccines must be updated to match novel strains, and vaccine effectiveness depends on the ability of scientists to predict nearly a year in advance which influenza variants will dominate in upcoming seasons. In this review, we highlight a promising new surveillance tool: predictive models. Based on data-sharing and close collaboration between the World Health Organization and academic scientists, these models use surveillance data to make quantitative predictions regarding influenza evolution. Predictive models demonstrate the potential of applied evolutionary biology to improve public health and disease control. We review the state of influenza predictive modeling and discuss next steps and recommendations to ensure that these models deliver upon their considerable biomedical promise.","467":"Due to a combination of ecological, political, and demographic factors, the emergence of novel pathogens has been increasingly observed in animals and humans in recent decades. Enhancing global capacity to study and interpret infectious disease surveillance data, and to develop data-driven computational models to guide policy, represents one of the most cost-effective, and yet overlooked, ways to prepare for the next pandemic. Epidemiological and behavioral data from recent pandemics and historic scourges have provided rich opportunities for validation of computational models, while new sequencing technologies and the 'big data' revolution present new tools for studying the epidemiology of outbreaks in real time. For the past two decades, the Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies (DIEPS) of the NIH Fogarty International Center has spearheaded two synergistic programs to better understand and devise control strategies for global infectious disease threats. The Multinational Influenza Seasonal Mortality Study (MISMS) has strengthened global capacity to study the epidemiology and evolutionary dynamics of influenza viruses in 80 countries by organizing international research activities and training workshops. The Research and Policy in Infectious Disease Dynamics (RAPIDD) program and its precursor activities has established a network of global experts in infectious disease modeling operating at the research-policy interface, with collaborators in 78 countries. These activities have provided evidence-based recommendations for disease control, including during large-scale outbreaks of pandemic influenza, Ebola and Zika virus. Together, these programs have coordinated international collaborative networks to advance the study of emerging disease threats and the field of computational epidemic modeling. A global community of researchers and policy-makers have used the tools and trainings developed by these programs to interpret infectious disease patterns in their countries, understand modeling concepts, and inform control policies. Here we reflect on the scientific achievements and lessons learnt from these programs (h-index\u2009=\u2009106 for RAPIDD and 79 for MISMS), including the identification of outstanding researchers and fellows; funding flexibility for timely research workshops and working groups (particularly relative to more traditional investigator-based grant programs); emphasis on group activities such as large-scale modeling reviews, model comparisons, forecasting challenges and special journal issues; strong quality control with a light touch on outputs; and prominence of training, data-sharing, and joint publications.","468":"Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) methods recruited a sample of 315 current intravenous drug users in rural Puerto Rico. Information about type and frequency of use, HIV and HVC risk behaviors (sharing needles, cookers, cotton, and water), sexual behaviors, and alcohol use was collected. HIV and HCV statuses were assessed via rapid antibody tests. T tests compare means of participants who tested positive (reactive) to those who tested negative. Logistic regression analyses were used to validate the association of the risk factors involved.Tests showed a significant difference in HIV (6%) and HCV (78.4%) prevalence among a population of current PWID. The main risk behaviors in HCV transmission are the sharing of injection \"works\", (e.g., cookers, cotton, and water). Sharing works occurred more than twice as often as the sharing of needles, and HCV+ and HCV- individuals reported the same needle sharing habits.Washing and rinsing injection works with water seems to prevent HIV transmission, but it is unable to prevent HCV infection. While education about the need to clean injection equipment with bleach might be beneficial, equipment sharing--and the subsequent risk of HVC--might be unavoidable in a context where participants are forced to pool resources to acquire and use intravenous drugs.Blood contained in needles and injection equipment has been identified as a vector for HIV and HCV transmission among people who inject drugs (PWID). Yet, there is often a wide discrepancy in prevalence for both viruses. While microbiological differences between viruses influence prevalence, other variables associated with the way drugs are acquired and used, also play a role.","469":"In early 2020, the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) rapidly spread across the United States, exhibiting significant geographic variability. While several studies have examined the predictive relationships of differing factors on COVID-19 deaths, few have looked at spatiotemporal variation at refined geographic scales. The objective of this analysis is to examine spatiotemporal variation of COVID-19 deaths in association with socioeconomic, health, demographic, and political factors, using regionalized multivariate regression as well as nationwide county-level geographically weighted random forest (GWRF) models. Analyses were performed on data from three sepearate timeframes: pandemic onset until May 2021, May 2021 through November 2021, and December 2021 until April 2022.Regionalized regression results across three time windows suggest that existing measures of social vulnerability for disaster preparedness (SVI) are associated with a higher degree of mortality from COVID-19. In comparison, GWRF models provide a more robust evaluation of feature importance and prediction, exposing the importance of local features, such as obesity, which is obscured by regional delineation. Overall, GWRF results indicate a more nuanced modeling strategy is useful for capturing the diverse spatial and temporal nature of the COVID-19 pandemic.","470":"More than fifty years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, health care for racial and ethnic minorities remains in many ways separate and unequal in the United States. Moreover, efforts to improve minority health care face challenges that differ from those confronted during de jure segregation. We review these challenges and examine whether stronger enforcement of existing civil rights legislation could help overcome them. We conclude that stronger enforcement of existing laws-for example, through executive orders to strengthen enforcement of the laws and congressional action to allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against providers who might have engaged in discrimination-would improve minority health care, but this approach is limited in what it can achieve. Complementary approaches outside the legal arena, such as quality improvement efforts and direct transfers of money to minority-serving providers-those seeing a disproportionate number of minority patients relative to their share of the population-might prove to be more effective.","471":"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, mathematical epidemiologists share their views on what models reveal about how the disease has spread, the current state of play and what work still needs to be done.","472":") important for invasion, immune evasion and pneumococcal tropism to CNS. The small effect sizes and negligible heritability indicated that causation of CNS infection requires multiple genetic and other factors reflecting a complex and polygenic aetiology.

It was established that 1 detects hydrazine up to 58\u00a0nM. The probe is useful for the detection of intracellular hydrazine in the human breast cancer cells MCF-7 using a fluorescence microscope. Spirolactam ring opening of 1, followed by its hydrolysis, was established as a probable mechanism for the selective sensing of hydrazine. ","474":"Aircraft wastewater surveillance has been proposed as a novel approach to monitor the global spread of pathogens. Here we develop a computational framework to provide actionable information for designing and estimating the effectiveness of global aircraft-based wastewater surveillance networks (WWSNs). We study respiratory diseases of varying transmission potentials and find that networks of 10 to 20 strategically placed wastewater sentinel sites can provide timely situational awareness and function effectively as an early warning system. The model identifies potential blind spots and suggests optimization strategies to increase WWSNs effectiveness while minimizing resource use. Our findings highlight that increasing the number of sentinel sites beyond a critical threshold does not proportionately improve WWSNs capabilities, stressing the importance of resource optimization. We show through retrospective analyses that WWSNs can significantly shorten the detection time for emerging pathogens. The presented approach offers a realistic analytic framework for the analysis of WWSNs at airports.","475":"Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.We used WHO and UNICEF estimates of national immunisation coverage for HPV vaccination in 84 countries during 2010-22. We used PRIME (Papillomavirus Rapid Interface for Modelling and Economics) to estimate the lifetime health impact of HPV vaccination on cervical cancer burden in terms of deaths, cases, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted by vaccination in their respective countries. We generated concentration indices and curves to assess the equity impact of HPV vaccination across 84 countries.While human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have been available since 2006, the coverage has varied among countries. Our aim is to analyse the equity impact of HPV vaccination on the lifetime projections of cervical cancer burden among vaccinated cohorts of 2010-22 in 84 countries.The health impact of HPV vaccination varied across the 84 countries and ranged from Switzerland to Tanzania at 2 to 34 deaths, 4 to 47 cases, and 40 to 735 DALYs averted per 1000 vaccinated adolescent girls over the lifetime of the vaccinated cohorts of 2010-22. The concentration index for the distribution of average coverage during 2010-22 among the 84 countries ranked by vaccine impact was 0.33 (95% CI: 0.27-0.40) and highlights the wide inequities in HPV vaccination coverage.Our findings suggested that countries with a relatively higher cervical cancer burden and thereby a relatively higher need for HPV vaccination had relatively lower coverage during 2010-22. Further, there were significant inequities in HPV vaccination coverage within the Americas, Europe, and Western Pacific regions, and in high- and low-income countries with a pro-advantaged and regressive distribution favouring countries with lower vaccine impact.","476":"In 2019, we estimated a total of 125\u2008105 (95% credible interval [CrI] 93\u2008736-165\u2008318) incident tuberculosis cases among incarcerated individuals globally. The estimated incidence rate per 100\u2008000 person-years overall was 1148 (95% CrI 860-1517) but varied greatly by WHO region, from 793 (95% CrI 430-1342) in the Eastern Mediterranean region to 2242 (1515-3216) in the African region. Global incidence per 100\u2008000 person-years between 2000 and 2012 among incarcerated individuals decreased from 1884 (95% CrI 1394-2616) to 1205 (910-1615); however, from 2013 onwards, tuberculosis incidence per 100\u2008000 person-years was stable, from 1183 (95% CrI 876-1596) in 2013 to 1148 (860-1517) in 2019. In 2019, the global case detection ratio was estimated to be 53% (95% CrI 42-64), the lowest over the study period.People who are incarcerated are at high risk of developing tuberculosis. We aimed to estimate the annual global, regional, and national incidence of tuberculosis among incarcerated populations from 2000 to 2019.We collected and aggregated data for tuberculosis incidence and prevalence estimates among incarcerated individuals in published and unpublished literature, annual tuberculosis notifications among incarcerated individuals at the country level, and the annual number of incarcerated individuals at the country level. We developed a joint hierarchical Bayesian meta-regression framework to simultaneously model tuberculosis incidence, notifications, and prevalence from 2000 to 2019. Using this model, we estimated trends in absolute tuberculosis incidence and notifications, the incidence and notification rates, and the case detection ratio by year, country, region, and globally.National Institutes of Health.Our estimates suggest a high tuberculosis incidence rate among incarcerated individuals globally with large gaps in tuberculosis case detection. Tuberculosis in incarcerated populations must be addressed with interventions specifically tailored to improve diagnoses and prevent transmission as a part of the broader global tuberculosis control effort.","477":"Callibration in mathematical models that are based on differential equations is known to be of fundamental importance. For sophisticated models such as age-structured models that simulate biological agents, parameter estimation or fitting (callibration) that solves all cases of data points available presents a formidable challenge, as efficiency considerations need to be employed in order for the method to become practical. In the case of multiscale models of hepatitis C virus dynamics that deal with partial differential equations (PDEs), a fully numerical parameter estimation method was developed that does not require an analytical approximation of the solution to the multiscale model equations, avoiding the necessity to derive the long-term approximation for each model. However, the method is considerably slow because of precision problems in estimating derivatives with respect to the parameters near their boundary values, making it almost impractical for general use. In order to overcome this limitation, two steps have been taken that significantly reduce the running time by orders of magnitude and thereby lead to a practical method. First, constrained optimization is used, letting the user add constraints relating to the boundary values of each parameter before the method is executed. Second, optimization is performed by derivative-free methods, eliminating the need to evaluate expensive numerical derviative approximations. These steps that were successful in significantly speeding up a highly non-efficient approach, rendering it practical, can also be adapted to multiscale models of other viruses and other sophisticated differential equation models. The newly efficient methods that were developed as a result of the above approach are described. Illustrations are provided using a user-friendly simulator that incorporates the efficient methods for multiscale models. We provide a simulator called HCVMultiscaleFit with a Graphical User Interface that applies these methods and is useful to perform parameter estimation for simulating viral dynamics during antiviral treatment.","478":"From June 2014 to October 2015, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services reported an outbreak of 90 cases of Legionnaires' disease, including 10 deaths, in Genesee County, Michigan. As Legionnaires' disease is not routinely tested for as a cause of community-acquired pneumonia, we hypothesized that the size of the outbreak was underestimated.These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the Legionnaires' disease outbreak was larger than reported. Earlier outbreak detection and response may have facilitated identification of additional cases.We used Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Wide-ranging ONline Data for Epidemiologic Research data to compare pneumonia mortality in Genesee to similar counties from 2011 to 2017. We used data from the Genesee County Vital Records Division to assess geographic overlap of pneumonia mortality with reported Legionnaires disease cases by census tract.We estimated 70.0 excess pneumonia deaths (90% uncertainty interval: 36-103) in Genesee County during the outbreak. Areas of high pneumonia mortality overlapped with those with high Legionnaires' disease incidence.","479":"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a vector-borne viral hemorrhagic disease with global clinical significance. Certain species of ticks are vectors of CCHF, which can be transmitted from animals to humans and humans to humans by direct exposure to blood or other body fluids. The zoonotic transmission at the human-animal interface from viremic animal hosts to humans is a public health concern with a paucity of data in Nigeria. Samples from 184 pastoral cattle from three local government areas (LGAs) of Plateau state, Nigeria, were screened for CCHF virus using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ID Screen\u00ae CCHF Double Antigen for Multi-Species). Overall seropositivity of 30.4% (n = 56) (95% CI: 23.88%, 37.63%) was recorded from the study areas in Plateau State, while 48\/126 (38.1%, 95% CI: 29.59%, 47.17%) sampled cows tested positive for CCHFV antibodies. Seropositivity was significantly higher (p < 0.001) among older cattle greater than two years, 54.69% (95% CI: 2.88%, 11.24%) compared to cattle younger than two years, 17.5% (95% CI: 11.17%, 25.50%). The location of farms played a significant role in the seropositivity of CCHF with the least risk observed in Wase LGA. CCHF is an important zoonotic disease in different parts of the globe with a high risk of transmission to pastoralists, livestock keepers\/slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians who handle animals. There is a need for a collaborative one-health approach with various stakeholders to unravel the dynamics of CCHFV epidemiology in Nigeria.","480":"To promote sustainable aquaculture, the formulation of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) feeds has changed in recent decades, focusing on replacing standard marine-based ingredients with plant-based alternatives, increasingly demonstrating successful outcomes in terms of fish performance. However, little is known about how these plant-based diets may impact the gut microbiota at first feeding and onwards. Nutritional programming (NP) is one strategy applied for exposing fish to a plant-based (V) diet at an early stage in life to promote full utilisation of plant-based ingredients and prevent potential adverse impacts of exposure to a plant-rich diet later in life. We investigated the impact of NP on gut microbiota by introducing fish to plant ingredients (V fish) during first feeding for a brief period of two weeks (stimulus phase) and compared those to fish fed a marine-based diet (M fish). Results demonstrated that V fish not only maintained growth performance at 16 (intermediate phase) and 22 (challenge phase) weeks post first feeding (wpff) when compared to M fish but also modulated gut microbiota. PERMANOVA general effects revealed gut microbiota dissimilarity by fish group (V vs. M fish) and phases (stimulus vs. intermediate vs. challenge). However, no interaction effect of both groups and phases was demonstrated, suggesting a sustained impact of V diet (nutritional history) on fish across time points\/phases. Moreover, the V diet exerted a significant cumulative modulatory effect on the Atlantic salmon gut microbiota at 16 wpff that was not demonstrated at two wpff, although both fish groups were fed the M diet at 16 wpff. The nutritional history\/dietary regime is the main NP influencing factor, whereas environmental and host factors significantly impacted microbiota composition in M fish. Microbial metabolic reactions of amino acid metabolism were higher in M fish when compared to V fish at two wpff suggesting microbiota played a role in digesting the essential amino acids of M feed. The excessive mucin O-degradation revealed in V fish at two wpff was mitigated in later life stages after NP, suggesting physiological adaptability and tolerance to V diet. Future studies are required to explore more fully how the microbiota functionally contributes to the NP.","481":"Network scientists often use complex dynamic processes to describe network contagions, but tools for fitting contagion models typically assume simple dynamics. Here, we address this gap by developing a nonparametric method to reconstruct a network and dynamics from a series of node states, using a model that breaks the dichotomy between simple pairwise and complex neighborhood-based contagions. We then show that a network is more easily reconstructed when observed through the lens of complex contagions if it is dense or the dynamic saturates, and that simple contagions are better otherwise.","482":"Estimates of the effectiveness of influenza vaccines are commonly obtained from a test-negative design (TND) study, where cases and controls are patients seeking care for an acute respiratory illness who test positive and negative, respectively, for influenza infection. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates from TND studies are usually interpreted as vaccine effectiveness against medically-attended influenza (MAI). However, it is also important to estimate VE against any influenza illness (symptomatic influenza (SI)) as individuals with SI are still a public health burden even if they do not seek medical care. We present a numerical method to evaluate the bias of TND-based estimates of influenza VE with respect to MAI and SI. We consider two sources of bias: (a) confounding bias due to a (possibly unobserved) covariate that is associated with both vaccination and the probability of the outcome of interest and (b) bias resulting from the effect of vaccination on the probability of seeking care. Our results indicate that (a) VE estimates may suffer from substantial confounding bias when a confounder has a different effect on the probabilities of influenza and non-influenza ARI, and (b) when vaccination reduces the probability of seeking care against influenza ARI, then estimates of VE against MAI may be unbiased while estimates of VE against SI may be have a substantial positive bias.","483":"Cancer poses danger because of its unregulated growth, development of resistance, and metastatic spread to vital organs. We currently lack quantitative theory for how preventive measures and post-diagnostic interventions are predicted to affect risks of a life threatening cancer. Here we evaluate how continuous measures, such as life style changes and traditional treatments, affect both neoplastic growth and the frequency of resistant clones. We then compare and contrast preventive and post-diagnostic interventions assuming that only a single lesion progresses to invasive carcinoma during the life of an individual, and resection either leaves residual cells or metastases are undetected. Whereas prevention generally results in more positive therapeutic outcomes than post-diagnostic interventions, this advantage is substantially lowered should prevention initially fail to arrest tumour growth. We discuss these results and other important mitigating factors that should be taken into consideration in a comparative understanding of preventive and post-diagnostic interventions. ","484":"A mathematical model is designed and used to assess population-level impact of basic non-pharmaceutical control measures on the 2014 Ebola outbreaks. The model incorporates the effects of traditional belief systems and customs, along with disease transmission within health-care settings and by Ebola-deceased individuals. A sensitivity analysis is performed to determine model parameters that most affect disease transmission. The model is parameterized using data from Guinea, one of the three Ebola-stricken countries. Numerical simulations are performed and the parameters that drive disease transmission, with or without basic public health control measures, determined. Three effectiveness levels of such basic measures are considered.The distribution of the basic reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) for Guinea (in the absence of basic control measures) is such that [Formula: see text], for the case when the belief systems do not result in more unreported Ebola cases. When such systems inhibit control efforts, the distribution increases to [Formula: see text]. The total Ebola cases are contributed by Ebola-deceased individuals (22%), symptomatic individuals in the early (33%) and latter (45%) infection stages. A significant reduction of new Ebola cases can be achieved by increasing health-care workers' daily shifts from 8 to 24 hours, limiting hospital visitation to 1 hour and educating the populace to abandon detrimental traditional\/cultural belief systems.Ebola is one of the most virulent human viral diseases, with a case fatality ratio between 25% to 90%. The 2014 West African outbreaks are the largest and worst in history. There is no specific treatment or effective\/safe vaccine against the disease. Hence, control efforts are restricted to basic public health preventive (non-pharmaceutical) measures. Such efforts are undermined by traditional\/cultural belief systems and customs, characterized by general mistrust and skepticism against government efforts to combat the disease. This study assesses the roles of traditional customs and public healthcare systems on the disease spread.The 2014 outbreaks are controllable using a moderately-effective basic public health intervention strategy alone. A much higher (>50%) disease burden would have been recorded in the absence of such intervention. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classifications 92B05, 93A30, 93C15.","485":"We implement an agent-based model for Clostridium difficile transmission in hospitals that accounts for several processes and individual factors including environmental and antibiotic heterogeneity in order to evaluate the efficacy of various control measures aimed at reducing environmental contamination and mitigating the effects of antibiotic use on transmission. In particular, we account for local contamination levels that contribute to the probability of colonization and we account for both the number and type of antibiotic treatments given to patients. Simulations illustrate the relative efficacy of several strategies for the reduction of nosocomial colonizations and nosocomial diseases.","486":"The COVID-19 pandemic placed significant strain on many health systems and economies. Mitigation policies decreased health impacts but had major macroeconomic impact. This paper reviews models combining epidemiological and macroeconomic projections to enable policymakers to consider both macroeconomic and health objectives.We found 80 papers modelling both the epidemiological and macroeconomic outcomes of COVID-19. Model scope is often limited to the impact of lockdown on health and total gross domestic product or aggregate consumption, and to high income countries. Just 14% of models assess disparities or poverty. Most models fall under four categories: compartmental-utility-maximization models, epidemiological models with stylized macroeconomic projections, epidemiological models linked to computable general equilibrium or input-output models, and epi-econ-ABMs. We propose a taxonomy comparing these approaches to guide future model development.A scoping review of epidemiological-macroeconomic models of COVID-19 was conducted, covering preprints, working papers and journal publications. We assessed model methodologies, scope, and application to empirical data.The epidemiological-macroeconomic models of COVID-19 identified have varying complexity and meet different modelling needs. Priorities for future modelling include increasing developing country applications, assessing disparities and poverty, and estimating of long-run impacts. This may require better integration between epidemiologists and economists.","487":"Ambient temperature is an important determinant of malaria transmission and suitability, affecting the life-cycle of the Plasmodium parasite and Anopheles vector. Early models predicted a thermal malaria transmission optimum of 31\u00a0\u00b0C, later revised to 25\u00a0\u00b0C using experimental data from mosquito and parasite biology. However, the link between ambient temperature and human malaria incidence remains poorly resolved.Malaria smear positivity varied between 42-83% across four clinic sites in western and coastal Kenya, with highest smear positivity in the rural, western site. The temperature ranges were cooler in the western sites and warmer in the coastal sites. In multivariate analysis controlling for socioeconomic status, age, sex, rainfall and bednet use, malaria smear positivity peaked near 25\u00a0\u00b0C at all four sites, as predicted a priori from an ecological model.To evaluate the relationship between ambient temperature and malaria risk, 5833 febrile children (<18\u00a0years-old) with an acute, non-localizing febrile illness were enrolled from four heterogenous outpatient clinic sites in Kenya (Chulaimbo, Kisumu, Msambweni and Ukunda). Thick and thin blood smears were evaluated for the presence of malaria parasites. Daily temperature estimates were obtained from land logger data, and rainfall from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Africa Rainfall Climatology (ARC) data. Thirty-day mean temperature and 30-day cumulative rainfall were estimated and each lagged by 30\u00a0days, relative to the febrile visit. A generalized linear mixed model was used to assess relationships between malaria smear positivity and predictors including temperature, rainfall, age, sex, mosquito exposure and socioeconomic status.This study provides direct field evidence of a unimodal relationship between ambient temperature and human malaria incidence with a peak in malaria transmission occurring at lower temperatures than previously recognized clinically. This nonlinear relationship with an intermediate optimal temperature implies that future climate warming could expand malaria incidence in cooler, highland regions while decreasing incidence in already warm regions with average temperatures above 25\u00a0\u00b0C. These findings support efforts to further understand the nonlinear association between ambient temperature and vector-borne diseases to better allocate resources and respond to disease threats in a future, warmer world.","488":"Parasites can mediate host fitness both directly, via effects on survival and reproduction, or indirectly by inducing host immune defense with costly side-effects. The evolution of immune defense is determined by a complex interplay of costs and benefits of parasite infection and immune response, all of which may differ for male and female hosts in sexual lineages. Here, we examine fitness costs associated with an inducible immune defense in a fish-cestode host-parasite system. Cestode infection induces peritoneal fibrosis in threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), constraining cestode growth and sometimes encasing and killing the parasite. Surveying two wild populations of stickleback, we confirm that the presence of fibrosis scar tissue is associated with reduced parasite burden in both male and female fish. However, fibrotic fish had lower foraging success and reproductive fitness (reduced female egg production and male nesting success), indicating strong costs of the lingering immunopathology. We show that these substantial sexually-concordant fitness effects of immune response act to align multivariate selection across the sexes, masking the signature of sexual antagonism that acted on morphology alone. Although both sexes experienced costs of fibrosis, the net impacts are unequal because in the two study populations females had higher cestode exposure. To evaluate whether this difference in risk should drive sex-specific immune strategies, we analyze a quantitative genetic model of host immune response to a trophically transmitted parasite. The model and empirical data illustrate how shared costs and benefits of immune response lead to shared evolutionary interests of male and female hosts, despite unequal infection risks across the sexes.","489":"Subject to a high burden of diarrheal diseases, Afghanistan is also susceptible to climate change. This study investigated the spatiotemporal distribution of diarrheal disease in the country and how associated it is with climate variables. Using monthly aggregated new cases of acute diarrhea reported between 2010 and 2016 and monthly averaged climate data at the district level, we fitted a hierarchical Bayesian spatiotemporal statistical model. We found aridity and mean daily temperature were positively associated with diarrhea incidence; every 1\u00b0C increase in mean daily temperature and 0.01-unit change in the aridity index were associated with a 0.70% (CI: 0.67%, 0.73%) increase and a 4.79% (CI: 4.30%, 5.26%) increase in the risk of diarrhea, respectively. Average annual temperature, on the other hand, was negatively associated, with a 3.7% (CI: 3.74%, 3.68) decrease in risk for every degree Celsius increase in annual average temperature. Temporally, most districts exhibited similar seasonal trends, with incidence peaking in summer, except for the eastern region where differences in climate patterns and population density may be associated with high rates of diarrhea throughout the year. The results from this study highlight the significant role of climate in shaping diarrheal patterns in Afghanistan, allowing policymakers to account for potential impacts of climate change in their public health assessments.","490":"A central focus of population genetics has been examining the contribution of selective and neutral processes in shaping patterns of intraspecies diversity. In terms of selection specifically, surveys of higher organisms have shown considerable variation in the relative contributions of background selection and genetic hitchhiking in shaping the distribution of polymorphisms, although these analyses have rarely been extended to bacteria and viruses. Here, we study the evolution of a ubiquitous, viral pathogen, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), by analysing the relationship among intraspecies diversity, interspecies divergence and rates of recombination. We show that there is a strong correlation between diversity and divergence, consistent with expectations of neutral evolution. However, after correcting for divergence, there remains a significant correlation between intraspecies diversity and recombination rates, with additional analyses suggesting that this correlation is largely due to the effects of background selection. In addition, a small number of loci, centred on long noncoding RNAs, also show evidence of selective sweeps. These data suggest that HCMV evolution is dominated by neutral mechanisms as well as background selection, expanding our understanding of linked selection to a novel class of organisms.","491":"The northeast region of India is highlighted as the most vulnerable region for malaria. This study attempts to explore the epidemiological profile and quantify the climate-induced influence on malaria cases in the context of tropical states, taking Meghalaya and Tripura as study areas. Monthly malaria cases and meteorological data from 2011 to 2018 and 2013 to 2019 were collected from the states of Meghalaya and Tripura, respectively. The nonlinear associations between individual and synergistic effect of meteorological factors and malaria cases were assessed, and climate-based malaria prediction models were developed using the generalized additive model (GAM) with Gaussian distribution. During the study period, a total of 216,943 and 125,926 cases were recorded in Meghalaya and Tripura, respectively, and majority of the cases occurred due to the infection of Plasmodium falciparum in both the states. The temperature and relative humidity in Meghalaya and temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, and soil moisture in Tripura showed a significant nonlinear effect on malaria; moreover, the synergistic effects of temperature and relative humidity (SI=2.37, RERI=0.58, AP=0.29) and temperature and rainfall (SI=6.09, RERI=2.25, AP=0.61) were found to be the key determinants of malaria transmission in Meghalaya and Tripura, respectively. The developed climate-based malaria prediction models are able to predict the malaria cases accurately in both Meghalaya (RMSE: 0.0889; R2: 0.944) and Tripura (RMSE: 0.0451; R2: 0.884). The study found that not only the individual climatic factors can significantly increase the risk of malaria transmission but also the synergistic effects of climatic factors can drive the malaria transmission multifold. This reminds the policymakers to pay attention to the control of malaria in situations with high temperature and relative humidity and high temperature and rainfall in Meghalaya and Tripura, respectively.","492":"All adult (\u226518 years old) patients who underwent lumbar spinal decompression and fusion for spondylolisthesis were identified using ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procedural coding systems. We calculated the modified frailty index (mFI) for each patient using 5 dichotomous comorbidities - diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, hypertension requiring medication, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and dependent functional status. Each comorbidity is assigned 1 point and the points are summed to give a score between 0 and 5. As in previous literature, we defined a score of 0 as \"not frail\", 1 as \"mild\" frailty, and 2 or greater as \"moderate to severe\" frailty.A retrospective cohort study was performed using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database from 2010 through 2016.There were a total of 5,296 patients identified, of which 2,030 (38.3%) were mFI=0, 2,319 (43.8%) patients mFI=1, and 947 (17.9%) were mFI \u22652. The mFI\u22652 cohort was older (p\u2264.001) and had a greater average BMI (p\u2264.001). The mFI\u22652 cohort had a slightly longer hospital stay (3.7 \u00b1 2.3 days vs. mFI=1: 3.5 \u00b1 2.8 days and mFI=0: 3.2 \u00b1 2.1 days,p\u2264.001). Both surgical AEs and medical AEs were significantly greater in the mFI\u22652 cohort than the other cohorts, (2.6% vs. mFI=1: 1.8% and mFI=0: 1.2%,p=.022) and (6.3% vs. mFI=1: 4.8% and mFI=0: 2.6%,p\u2264.001), respectively. While there was no significant difference in reoperation rates, the mFI\u22652 cohort had greater unplanned 30-day readmission rates (8;4% vs. mFI=5.6: 4.8% and mFI=0: 3.4%,p\u2264.001). However, on multivariate regression analysis, mFI\u22652 was not a significant independent predictor of LOS (p=.285), complications (p=.667), or 30-day unplanned readmission (p=.378).The aim of this study was to investigate the impact that frailty has on LOS, complication rate, and unplanned readmission after posterior lumbar spinal fusion for spondylolisthesis.Frailty has been associated with inferior surgical outcomes in various fields of spinal surgery. With increasing healthcare costs, hospital length of stay (LOS) and unplanned readmissions have emerged as clinical proxies reflecting overall value of care. However, there is a paucity of data assessing the impact that baseline frailty has on quality of care in patients with spondylolisthesis.Patient demographics, comorbidities, complications, LOS, readmission, and reoperation were assessed.Our study indicates that frailty, as measured by the mFI, does not significantly predict LOS, 30-day adverse events, or 30-day unplanned readmission in patients undergoing lumbar spinal decompression and fusion for spondylolisthesis. Further work is needed to better define variable inputs that make up frailty to optimize surgical outcome prediction tools that impact the value of care.A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of adverse events (AEs), extended LOS, complications, and unplanned readmission.","493":"Trophic interactions are likely to change under climate warming. These interactions can be altered directly by changing consumption rates, or indirectly by altering growth rates and size asymmetries among individuals that in turn affect feeding. Understanding these processes is particularly important for intraspecific interactions, as direct and indirect changes may exacerbate antagonistic interactions. We examined the effect of temperature on activity rate, growth and intraspecific size asymmetries, and how these temperature dependencies affected cannibalism in Lestes congener, a damselfly with marked intraspecific variation in size. Temperature increased activity rates and exacerbated differences in body size by increasing growth rates. Increased activity and changes in body size interacted to increase cannibalism at higher temperatures. We argue that our results are likely to be general to species with life-history stages that vary in their temperature dependencies, and that the effects of climate change on communities may depend on the temperature dependencies of intraspecific interactions.","494":"Adequacy of the current clinical definition of institutional influenza outbreaks is unclear. We performed a retrospective genome sequencing and epidemiologic analysis of institutional influenza outbreaks that occurred during the 2014-15 influenza season in Toronto, Canada. We sequenced the 2 earliest submitted samples positive for influenza A(H3N2) from each of 38 reported institutional outbreaks in long-term care facilities. Genome sequencing showed most outbreak pairs identified by using the current clinical definition were highly related. Inclusion of surveillance samples demonstrated that outbreak sources were likely introductions from broader circulating lineages. Pairwise distance analysis using majority genome and hemagglutinin-specific genes enabled identification of thresholds for discrimination of within and between outbreak pairs; the area under the curve ranged 0.93-0.95. Routine genome sequencing for defining influenza outbreaks in long-term care facilities is unlikely to add significantly to the current clinical definition. Sequencing may prove most useful for investigating sources of outbreak introductions.","495":"Blood coagulation is a vital physiological process involving a complex network of biochemical reactions, which converge to form a blood clot that repairs vascular injury. This process unfolds in three phases: initiation, amplification, and propagation, ultimately leading to thrombin formation. Coagulation begins when tissue factor (TF) is exposed on an injured vessel's wall. The first step is when activated factor VII (VIIa) in the plasma binds to TF, forming complex TF:VIIa, which activates factor X. Activated factor X (Xa) is necessary for coagulation, so the regulation of its activation is crucial. Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) is a critical regulator of the initiation phase as it inhibits the activation of factor X. While previous studies have proposed two pathways-direct and indirect binding-for TFPI's inhibitory role, the specific biochemical reactions and their rates remain ambiguous. Many existing mathematical models only assume an indirect pathway, which may be less effective under physiological flow conditions. In this study, we revisit datasets from two experiments focused on activated factor X formation in the presence of TFPI. We employ an adaptive Metropolis method for parameter estimation to reinvestigate a previously proposed biochemical scheme and corresponding rates for both inhibition pathways. Our findings show that both pathways are essential to replicate the static experimental results. Previous studies have suggested that flow itself makes a significant contribution to the inhibition of factor X activation. We added flow to this model with our estimated parameters to determine the contribution of the two inhibition pathways under these conditions. We found that direct binding of TFPI is necessary for inhibition under flow. The indirect pathway has a weaker inhibitory effect due to removal of solution phase inhibitory complexes by flow.","496":"Stepped wedge designs have uni-directional crossovers at randomly assigned time points (steps) where clusters switch from control to intervention condition. Incomplete stepped wedge designs are increasingly used in cluster randomized trials of health care interventions and have periods without data collection due to logistical, resource and patient-centered considerations. The development of sample size formulae for stepped wedge trials has primarily focused on complete designs and continuous responses. Addressing this gap, a general, fast, non-simulation based power procedure is proposed for generalized estimating equations analysis of complete and incomplete stepped wedge designs and its predicted power is compared to simulated power for binary and continuous responses. An extensive set of simulations for six and twelve clusters is based upon the Connect-Home trial with an incomplete stepped wedge design. Results show that empirical test size is well controlled using a t-test with bias-corrected sandwich variance estimator for as few as six clusters. Analytical power agrees well with a simulated power in scenarios with twelve clusters. For six clusters, analytical power is similar to simulated power with estimation using the correctly specified model-based variance estimator. To explore the impact of study design choice on power, the proposed fast GEE power method is applied to the Connect-Home trial design, four alternative incomplete stepped wedge designs and one complete design.","497":"Ralstonia solanacearum displays variability in its virulence to solanaceous crops. We report here the draft genome sequences of eight phylotype I strains and one phylotype III strain differing in virulence to the resistant eggplant genotype AG91-25. These data will allow the identification of virulence- and avirulence-related genes. ","498":"Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference can now take advantage of powerful machine learning algorithms to complement traditional experimental methods in building gene networks. However, the dynamical nature of embryonic development-representing the time-dependent interactions between thousands of transcription factors, signaling molecules, and effector genes-is one of the most challenging arenas for GRN prediction. In this work, we show that successful GRN predictions for a developmental network from gene expression data alone can be obtained with the Priors Enriched Absent Knowledge (PEAK) network inference algorithm. PEAK is a noise-robust method that models gene expression dynamics via ordinary differential equations and selects the best network based on information-theoretic criteria coupled with the machine learning algorithm Elastic Net. We test our GRN prediction methodology using two gene expression datasets for the purple sea urchin, Stronglyocentrotus purpuratus, and cross-check our results against existing GRN models that have been constructed and validated by over 30 years of experimental results. Our results find a remarkably high degree of sensitivity in identifying known gene interactions in the network (maximum 81.58%). We also generate novel predictions for interactions that have not yet been described, which provide a resource for researchers to use to further complete the sea urchin GRN. Published ChIPseq data and spatial co-expression analysis further support a subset of the top novel predictions. We conclude that GRN predictions that match known gene interactions can be produced using gene expression data alone from developmental time series experiments.","499":"This research examines the larger-scale associations between obesity and food environments in metropolitan areas in the United States (US). The US Census County Business Patterns dataset for 2011 was used to construct various indices of food environments for selected metropolitan areas. The numbers of employees engaged in supermarkets, convenience stores, full service restaurants, fast food restaurants, and snack\/coffee shops were standardised using the location quotients, and factor analysis was used to produce two uncorrelated factors measuring food environments. Data on obesity were obtained from the 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Individual level obesity measures were linked to the metropolitan area level food environment factors. Models were fitted using generalised estimating equations to control for metropolitan area level intra-correlation and individual level sociodemographic characteristics. It was found that adults residing in cities with a large share of supermarket and full-service restaurant workers were less likely to be obese, while adults residing in cities with a large share of convenience store and fast food restaurant workers were more likely to be obese. Supermarkets and full-service restaurant workers are concentrated in the Northeast and West of the US, where obesity prevalence is relatively lower, while convenience stores and fast-food restaurant workers are concentrated in the South and Midwest, where obesity prevalence is relatively higher. The food environment landscapes measured at the metropolitan area level explain the continental-scale patterns of obesity prevalence. The types of food that are readily available and widely served may translate into obesity disparities across metropolitan areas. ","500":"Evidence suggests that dental emergencies are likely to occur when preferred care is less accessible. Communication barriers often exist that cause patients to receive suboptimal treatment or experience discomfort for extended lengths of time. Furthermore, limitations in the conventional approach for managing dental emergencies prevent dentists from receiving critical information before patient visits.Patient-provided information accompanied by high-resolution images may help dentists substantially in predicting urgency or preparing necessary treatment resources. The results illustrate the feasibility of patients using smartphone applications to report dental emergencies. This technology allows dentists to assess care remotely when direct patient contact is less practical.This study's results demonstrate that patients can use mobile applications to transmit clinical data to their dentists and suggest the possibility of expanding the use of mobile applications to enhance access to routine and emergency dental care. The authors addressed how to enable patients to communicate emergency needs directly to a dentist while obviating patient emergency department visits.The authors developed a mobile application to mediate the uncertainty of dental emergencies. The development and study consisted of a needs analysis and quality assessment of intraoral images captured by smartphones, prototype development, refining the prototype through usability inspection methods, and formative evaluation through usability testing with prospective users.The developed application successfully guided all users through a series of questions designed to capture clinically meaningful data by using familiar smartphone functions. All participants were able to complete a report within 4 minutes, and all clinical information was comprehended by the users.","501":"Purpose We extended our earlier study on normative growth curves for intelligibility development in typical children from 30 to 119 months of age. We also determined quantile-specific age of steepest growth and growth rates. A key goal was to establish age-specific benchmarks for single-word and multiword intelligibility. Method This cross-sectional study involved collection of in-person speech samples from 538 typically developing children (282 girls and 256 boys) who passed speech, language, and hearing screening measures. One thousand seventy-six normal-hearing na\u00efve adult listeners (280 men and 796 women) orthographically transcribed children's speech. Speech intelligibility was measured as the percentage of words transcribed correctly by naive adults, with single-word and multiword intelligibility outcomes modeled separately. Results The age range for 50% single-word intelligibility was 31-47 months (50th-5th percentiles), the age range for 75% single-word intelligibility was 49-87 months, and the age range for 90% intelligibility for single words was 83-120+ months. The same milestones were attained for multiword intelligibility at 34-46, 46-61, and 62-87 months, respectively. The age of steepest growth for the 50th percentile was 30-31 months for both single-word and multiword intelligibility and was later for children in lower percentiles. The maximum growth rate was 1.7 intelligibility percentage points per month for single words and 2.5 intelligibility percentage points per month for multiword intelligibility. Conclusions There was considerable variability in intelligibility development among typical children. For children in median and lower percentiles, intelligibility growth continues through 9 years. Children should be at least 50% intelligible by 48 months.

Thus far, the inquiry has been told that planning has been wholly inadequate and that a future outbreak is inevitable. We present here four key problems that contributed to significant morbidity and mortality during the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic over the past 3 years in the UK - and which will contribute to excess morbidity and mortality in the next outbreak. First, there was misunderstanding about what procedures were deemed as aerosol generating. Aerosol transmission has always been a component of respiratory viruses; however, no specific aerosol-generating procedures are required to transmit any respiratory pathogens over long distances. Second, policy-makers were too binary in their answers to the public in terms of questions about severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This meant that, as evidence evolved and different conclusions were drawn, the public lost faith in both the UK Government and science. Third, public health guidance did not take into account that certain groups would be impacted differentially by public health guidelines and instead used a one-size-fits-all approach to non-pharmaceutical interventions. Finally, there was worsening of existing inequalities, especially in ethnic minority groups, that resulted in excessive numbers within certain cohorts becoming infected.","503":"Understanding how the metabolic rates of prokaryotes respond to temperature is fundamental to our understanding of how ecosystem functioning will be altered by climate change, as these micro-organisms are major contributors to global carbon efflux. Ecological metabolic theory suggests that species living at higher temperatures evolve higher growth rates than those in cooler niches due to thermodynamic constraints. Here, using a global prokaryotic dataset, we find that maximal growth rate at thermal optimum increases with temperature for mesophiles (temperature optima [Formula: see text]C), but not thermophiles ([Formula: see text]C). Furthermore, short-term (within-day) thermal responses of prokaryotic metabolic rates are typically more sensitive to warming than those of eukaryotes. Because climatic warming will mostly impact ecosystems in the mesophilic temperature range, we conclude that as microbial communities adapt to higher temperatures, their metabolic rates and therefore, biomass-specific CO[Formula: see text] production, will inevitably rise. Using a mathematical model, we illustrate the potential global impacts of these findings.","504":"Identifying drivers of viral diversity is key to understanding the evolutionary as well as epidemiological dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using rich viral genomic data sets, we show that periods of steadily rising diversity have been punctuated by sudden, enormous increases followed by similarly abrupt collapses of diversity. We introduce a mechanistic model of saltational evolution with epistasis and demonstrate that these features parsimoniously account for the observed temporal dynamics of inter-genomic diversity. Our results provide support for recent proposals that saltational evolution may be a signature feature of SARS-CoV-2, allowing the pathogen to more readily evolve highly transmissible variants. These findings lend theoretical support to a heightened awareness of biological contexts where increased diversification may occur. They also underline the power of pathogen genomics and other surveillance streams in clarifying the phylodynamics of emerging and endemic infections. In public health terms, our results further underline the importance of equitable distribution of up-to-date vaccines.","505":"Several factors may determine SIV uptake and vaccination adherence among older people. More studies are needed to provide a stronger evidence base for planning more effective influenza vaccination programs.Despite influenza vaccination programs in various jurisdictions, seasonal influenza vaccine (SIV) uptake remains suboptimal among older people (\u226565years old), an important subpopulation for influenza vaccination. We sought to summarize determinants of SIV uptake (any vaccine receipt) and vaccination adherence (receipt of vaccine in two or more seasons in sequence) among older people.Out of 11,570 citations screened, we included 34 cross-sectional studies. The following were associated with increased SIV uptake: being older (OR 1.52, 95%CI 1.38-1.67 [21 studies]), white (1.30, 1.14-1.49 [10 studies]), married (1.23, 1.17-1.28 [9 studies]), non-smoker (1.28, 1.11-1.47 [7 studies]), of a higher social class (1.20, 1.06-1.36 [2 studies]), having a higher education (1.12, 1.04-1.21 [14 studies]), having a higher household income (1.11, 1.05-1.18 [8 studies]), having a chronic illness (1.53, 1.44-1.63 [16 studies]), having poor self-assessed health (1.23, 1.02-1.40 [9 studies]), having a family doctor (2.94, 1.79-4.76 [2 studies]), and having health insurance (1.58, 1.13-2.21 [6 studies]). The influence of these factors varied across geographical regions. Being older (1.26, 1.11-1.44 [2 studies]) was also associated with increased vaccination adherence.We searched for population-based studies conducted in community-dwelling older people (irrespective of their health status) from 2000-2019. Two reviewers independently selected publications for inclusion. One reviewer extracted data from the included studies; a second checked the extracted data for errors. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus, or a third reviewer. We were interested in the determinants of SIV uptake and vaccination adherence. Where appropriate, we pooled adjusted results using the inverse variance, random-effects method and reported the odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI).","506":"The global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emphasized the need for evidence-based strategies for the safe operation of schools during pandemics that balance infection risk with the society's responsibility of allowing children to attend school. Due to limited empirical data, existing analyses assessing school-based interventions in pandemic situations often impose strong assumptions, for example, on the relationship between class size and transmission risk, which could bias the estimated effect of interventions, such as split classes and staggered attendance. To fill this gap in school outbreak studies, we parameterized an individual-based model that accounts for heterogeneous contact rates within and between classes and grades to a multischool outbreak data of influenza. We then simulated school outbreaks of respiratory infectious diseases of ongoing threat (i.e., COVID-19) and potential threat (i.e., pandemic influenza) under a variety of interventions (changing class structures, symptom screening, regular testing, cohorting, and responsive class closures). Our results suggest that interventions changing class structures (e.g., reduced class sizes) may not be effective in reducing the risk of major school outbreaks upon introduction of a case and that other precautionary measures (e.g., screening and isolation) need to be employed. Class-level closures in response to detection of a case were also suggested to be effective in reducing the size of an outbreak.","507":"HIV prevalence varies markedly throughout Africa, and it is often presumed areas of higher HIV prevalence (i.e., hotspots) serve as sources of infection to neighboring areas of lower prevalence. However, the small-scale geography of migration networks and movement of HIV-positive individuals between communities is poorly understood. Here, we use population-based data from ~22,000 persons of known HIV status to characterize migratory patterns and their relationship to HIV among 38 communities in Rakai, Uganda with HIV prevalence ranging from 9 to 43%. We find that migrants moving into hotspots had significantly higher HIV prevalence than migrants moving elsewhere, but out-migration from hotspots was geographically dispersed, contributing minimally to HIV burden in destination locations. Our results challenge the assumption that high prevalence hotspots are drivers of transmission in regional epidemics, instead suggesting that migrants with high HIV prevalence, particularly women, selectively migrate to these areas.","508":"We examined patterns of genetic clustering among individuals diagnosed with HIV between 2010 and 2018 using data from King County, Washington's National HIV Surveillance System. Among 2,371 individuals newly diagnosed with HIV, 231 (10%) experienced unstable housing or were living homeless at the time of diagnosis. Among the 1,658 (70%) people with an available HIV-1 pol gene sequence, 1,071 (65%) were identified to be part of 296 genetic clusters. In our analysis, housing status was not associated with genetic clustering (OR 1.02; 95%CI:0.75,1.39). After adjusting for demographic and behavioral factors, people who were living homeless at HIV diagnosis had 35% lower odds of being identified as part of a genetic cluster (AOR 0.65; 95%CI:0.44,0.95) compared to people with stable housing. Our findings highlight that people experiencing unstable housing are disproportionately burdened by HIV, and that within this population in King County, being in a genetic cluster is predominantly associated with substance use.","509":"Virtual conferences can offer significant benefits but require considerable planning and creativity to be successful. Here we describe the successes and failures of a hybrid in-person\/virtual conference model. The COVID-19 epidemic presents the scientific community with an opportunity to pioneer novel models that effectively engage virtual participants to advance conference goals.","510":"Developing and distributing a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccine has garnered immense global interest. Less than a year after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, several vaccine candidates had received emergency use authorization across a range of countries. Despite this scientific breakthrough, the journey from vaccine discovery to global herd immunity against COVID-19 continues to present significant policy challenges that require a collaborative, global response. We offer a framework for understanding remaining and new policy challenges for successful global vaccine campaigns against COVID-19 as well as potential solutions to address them. Decision-makers must be aware of these challenges and strategize solutions that can be implemented at scale. These include challenges around maintaining R&D incentives, running clinical trials, authorizations, post-market surveillance, manufacturing and supply, global dissemination, allocation, uptake, and clinical system adaption. Alongside these challenges, financial and ethical concerns must also be addressed.","511":"Here, we combine multiple modelling methods for burden estimation to predict national case burden disaggregated by severity and map the distribution of burden across the country using three separate data sources. An ensemble of transmission models then predicts the estimated reduction in dengue transmission following a nationwide roll-out of wMel Wolbachia.These results suggest interventions targeted to the highest burden cities can have a disproportionate impact on dengue burden. Area-wide interventions, such as Wolbachia, that are deployed based on the area covered could protect people more efficiently than individual-based interventions, such as vaccines, in such dense environments.Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes reduce dengue virus transmission, and city-wide releases in Yogyakarta city, Indonesia, are showing promising entomological results. Accurate estimates of the burden of dengue, its spatial distribution and the potential impact of Wolbachia are critical in guiding funder and government decisions on its future wider use.We estimate that 7.8 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1.8-17.7 million) symptomatic dengue cases occurred in Indonesia in 2015 and were associated with 332,865 (UI 94,175-754,203) lost disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The majority of dengue's burden was due to non-severe cases that did not seek treatment or were challenging to diagnose in outpatient settings leading to substantial underreporting. Estimated burden was highly concentrated in a small number of large cities with 90% of dengue cases occurring in 15.3% of land area. Implementing a nationwide Wolbachia population replacement programme was estimated to avert 86.2% (UI 36.2-99.9%) of cases over a long-term average.","512":"We did a population-based study of COVID-19 testing behaviours with mass COVID-19 testing data for England and data from community prevalence surveillance surveys (REACT-1 and ONS-CIS) from Oct 1, 2020, to March 30, 2022. We used mass testing data for lateral flow device (LFD; data for approximately 290 million tests performed and reported) and PCR (data for approximately 107 million tests performed and returned from the laboratory) tests made available for the general public and provided by date and self-reported age and ethnicity at the lower tier local authority (LTLA) level. We also used publicly available data on mean population size estimates for individual LTLAs, and data on ethnic groups, age groups, and deprivation indices for LTLAs. We did not have access to REACT-1 or ONS-CIS prevalence data disaggregated by sex or gender. Using a mechanistic causal model to debias the PCR testing data, we obtained estimates of weekly SARS-CoV-2 prevalence by both self-reported ethnic groups and age groups for LTLAs in England. This approach to debiasing the PCR (or LFD) testing data also estimated a testing bias parameter defined as the odds of testing in infected versus not infected individuals, which would be close to zero if the likelihood of test seeking (or seeking and reporting) was the same regardless of infection status. With confirmatory PCR data, we estimated false positivity rates, sensitivity, specificity, and the rate of decline in detection probability subsequent to reporting a positive LFD for PCR tests by sociodemographic groups. We also estimated the daily incidence, allowing us to calculate the fraction of cases captured by the testing programme.Understanding underlying mechanisms of heterogeneity in test-seeking and reporting behaviour during an infectious disease outbreak can help to protect vulnerable populations and guide equity-driven interventions. The COVID-19 pandemic probably exerted different stresses on individuals in different sociodemographic groups and ensuring fair access to and usage of COVID-19 tests was a crucial element of England's testing programme. We aimed to investigate the relationship between sociodemographic factors and COVID-19 testing behaviours in England during the COVID-19 pandemic.From March, 2021 onwards, individuals in the most deprived regions reported approximately half as many LFD tests per capita as individuals in the least deprived areas (median ratio 0\u00b750 [IQR 0\u00b744-0\u00b754]). During the period October, 2020, to June, 2021, PCR testing patterns showed the opposite trend, with individuals in the most deprived areas performing almost double the number of PCR tests per capita than those in the least deprived areas (1\u00b78 [1\u00b77-1\u00b79]). Infection prevalences in Asian or Asian British individuals were considerably higher than those of other ethnic groups during the alpha (B.1.1.7) and omicron (B.1.1.529) BA.1 waves. Our estimates indicate that the England Pillar 2 COVID-19 testing programme detected 26-40% of all cases (including asymptomatic cases) over the study period with no consistent differences by deprivation levels or ethnic groups. Testing biases for PCR were generally higher than those for LFDs, in line with the general policy of symptomatic and asymptomatic use of these tests. Deprivation and age were associated with testing biases on average; however, the uncertainty intervals overlapped across deprivation levels, although the age-specific patterns were more distinct. We also found that ethnic minorities and older individuals were less likely to use confirmatory PCR tests through most of the pandemic and that delays in reporting a positive LFD test were possibly longer in populations self-reporting as \"Black; African; Black British or Caribbean\".Differences in testing behaviours across sociodemographic groups might be reflective of the higher costs of self-isolation to vulnerable populations, differences in test accessibility, differences in digital literacy, and differing perceptions about the utility of tests and risks posed by infection. This study shows how mass testing data can be used in conjunction with surveillance surveys to identify gaps in the uptake of public health interventions both at fine-scale levels and across sociodemographic groups. It provides a framework for monitoring local interventions and yields valuable lessons for policy makers in ensuring an equitable response to future pandemics.UK Health Security Agency.","513":"Sustained and coordinated vaccination efforts have brought polio eradication within reach. Anticipating the eradication of wild poliovirus (WPV) and the subsequent challenges in preventing its re-emergence, we look to the past to identify why polio rose to epidemic levels in the mid-20th century, and how WPV persisted over large geographic scales. We analyzed an extensive epidemiological dataset, spanning the 1930s to the 1950s and spatially replicated across each state in the United States, to glean insight into the drivers of polio's historical expansion and the ecological mode of its persistence prior to vaccine introduction. We document a latitudinal gradient in polio's seasonality. Additionally, we fitted and validated mechanistic transmission models to data from each US state independently. The fitted models revealed that: (1) polio persistence was the product of a dynamic mosaic of source and sink populations; (2) geographic heterogeneity of seasonal transmission conditions account for the latitudinal structure of polio epidemics; (3) contrary to the prevailing \"disease of development\" hypothesis, our analyses demonstrate that polio's historical expansion was straightforwardly explained by demographic trends rather than improvements in sanitation and hygiene; and (4) the absence of clinical disease is not a reliable indicator of polio transmission, because widespread polio transmission was likely in the multiyear absence of clinical disease. As the world edges closer to global polio eradication and continues the strategic withdrawal of the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV), the regular identification of, and rapid response to, these silent chains of transmission is of the utmost importance. ","514":"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major clinical and public health concern. The primary surgical treatment of knee OA is total knee replacement (TKR), a procedure that aims to alleviate pain and restore physical function. TKR is expensive, however, and based on professional guidelines, inappropriately performed in up to a third of patients. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) help evaluate treatment options by quantifying health outcomes that matter to patients and can thus inform shared decision-making (SDM) between patients and health professionals.Ethics approval has been obtained from The University of Texas at Austin Institutional Review Board (protocol number: 2018-11-0042). Informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Study results will be disseminated through conference presentations, publications and professional societies.This is a US-based 2-year, two-site hybrid type 1 study to assess clinical effectiveness and implementation of a machine learning-based patient decision aid (PDA) integrating patient-reported outcomes and clinical variables to support SDM for patients with knee OA considering TKR. Substudy 1: At one study site, a randomised controlled trial is evaluating the clinical effectiveness of the PDA and SDM process on decision quality as measured after the baseline consultation and treatment choice measured 3 and 6 months after the baseline visit among 200 patients with knee OA. Substudy 2: At a second study site, a qualitative assessment using principles of behaviour design and intervention mapping is evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of the PROMs, PDA and SDM process by interviewing seven health professionals and 25 patients before and 25 patients after PDA implementation.NCT04805554.","515":"Bed bugs have reemerged in the United States and worldwide over recent decades, presenting a major challenge to both public health practitioners and housing authorities. A number of municipalities have proposed or initiated policies to stem the bed bug epidemic, but little guidance is available to evaluate them. One contentious policy is disclosure, whereby landlords are obligated to notify potential tenants of current or prior bed bug infestations. Aimed to protect tenants from leasing an infested rental unit, disclosure also creates a kind of quarantine, partially and temporarily removing infested units from the market. Here, we develop a mathematical model for the spread of bed bugs in a generalized rental market, calibrate it to parameters of bed bug dispersion and housing turnover, and use it to evaluate the costs and benefits of disclosure policies to landlords. We find disclosure to be an effective control policy to curb infestation prevalence. Over the short term (within 5 years), disclosure policies result in modest increases in cost to landlords, while over the long term, reductions of infestation prevalence lead, on average, to savings. These results are insensitive to different assumptions regarding the prevalence of infestation, rate of introduction of bed bugs from other municipalities, and the strength of the quarantine effect created by disclosure. Beyond its application to bed bugs, our model offers a framework to evaluate policies to curtail the spread of household pests and is appropriate for systems in which spillover effects result in highly nonlinear cost-benefit relationships.","516":" in Benin. This framework allows us to determine the rational non-lethal harvesting level and habitat size to ensure the stability of the plant ecosystem, and to study the impacts of distinct levels of humidity. We suggest non-lethal harvesting policies that maximize the economic benefit for local populations.","517":"COVID-19 nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including mask wearing, have proved highly effective at reducing the transmission of endemic infections. A key public health question is whether NPIs could continue to be implemented long term to reduce the ongoing burden from endemic pathogens. Here, we use epidemiological models to explore the impact of long-term NPIs on the dynamics of endemic infections. We find that the introduction of NPIs leads to a strong initial reduction in incidence, but this effect is transient: As susceptibility increases, epidemics return while NPIs are in place. For low R0 infections, these return epidemics are of reduced equilibrium incidence and epidemic peak size. For high R0 infections, return epidemics are of similar magnitude to pre-NPI outbreaks. Our results underline that managing ongoing susceptible buildup, e.g., with vaccination, remains an important long-term goal.","518":"Giant cell tumor (GCT) of bone was first described almost 200 years ago, but the optimal treatment continues to evolve. We present a patient with a pelvic GCT who was treated with embolization, 20 months of denosumab therapy, and resection. Histologically, the tumor consisted of degenerated GCT, bone, and fibrous tissue. After 7 months, the patient was found to have osteosarcoma at the site of the initial lesion as well as pulmonary metastases.The apparent malignant transformation of a GCT of bone treated initially with denosumab indicates that close follow-up is warranted.","519":"Increasing urbanization is having a profound effect on infectious disease risk, posing significant challenges for governments to allocate limited resources for their optimal control at a sub-city scale. With recent advances in data collection practices, empirical evidence about the efficacy of highly localized containment and intervention activities, which can lead to optimal deployment of resources, is possible. However, there are several challenges in analyzing data from such real-world observational settings. Using data on 3.9 million instances of seven dengue vector containment activities collected between 2012 and 2017, here we develop and assess two frameworks for understanding how the generation of new dengue cases changes in space and time with respect to application of different types of containment activities. Accounting for the non-random deployment of each containment activity in relation to dengue cases and other types of containment activities, as well as deployment of activities in different epidemiological contexts, results from both frameworks reinforce existing knowledge about the efficacy of containment activities aimed at the adult phase of the mosquito lifecycle. Results show a 10% (95% CI: 1-19%) and 20% reduction (95% CI: 4-34%) reduction in probability of a case occurring in 50 meters and 30 days of cases which had Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) and fogging performed in the immediate vicinity, respectively, compared to cases of similar epidemiological context and which had no containment in their vicinity. Simultaneously, limitations due to the real-world nature of activity deployment are used to guide recommendations for future deployment of resources during outbreaks as well as data collection practices. Conclusions from this study will enable more robust and comprehensive analyses of localized containment activities in resource-scarce urban settings and lead to improved allocation of resources of government in an outbreak setting.","520":"It is generally agreed that bacterial diversity can be classified into genetically and ecologically cohesive units, but what produces such variation is a topic of intensive research. Recombination may maintain coherent species of frequently recombining bacteria, but the emergence of distinct clusters within a recombining species, and the impact of habitat structure in this process are not well described, limiting our understanding of how new species are created. Here we present a model of bacterial evolution in overlapping habitat space. We show that the amount of habitat overlap determines the outcome for a pair of clusters, which may range from fast clonal divergence with little interaction between the clusters to a stationary population structure, where different clusters maintain an equilibrium distance between each other for an indefinite time. We fit our model to two data sets. In Streptococcus pneumoniae, we find a genomically and ecologically distinct subset, held at a relatively constant genetic distance from the majority of the population through frequent recombination with it, while in Campylobacter jejuni, we find a minority population we predict will continue to diverge at a higher rate. This approach may predict and define speciation trajectories in multiple bacterial species.","521":"Based on available data, using high-dose influenza vaccine or RIV in middle-aged, high-risk patients may be an economically favorable vaccination strategy with public health benefits. Clinical trials of these vaccines in this population may be warranted.High-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV3) or recombinant trivalent influenza vaccine (RIV) may increase influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) in adults with conditions that place them at high risk for influenza complications. This analysis models the public health impact and cost-effectiveness (CE) of these vaccines for 50-64year-olds.The least expensive strategy was SD-IIV3 only, with total costs of $99.84\/person. The SD-IIV4 only strategy cost an additional $0.91\/person, or $37,700\/QALY gained. The HD-IIV3 & SD-IIV4 strategy cost $1.06 more than SD-IIV4 only, or $71,500\/QALY gained. No vaccination and HD-IIV3 & SD-IIV3 strategies were dominated. Results were sensitive to influenza incidence, vaccine cost, standard-dose VE in the entire population and high-dose VE in high-risk patients. The CE of RIV for high-risk patients was dependent on as yet unknown parameter values.Markov model CE analysis compared 5 strategies in 50-64year-olds: no vaccination; only standard-dose IIV3 offered (SD-IIV3 only), only quadrivalent influenza vaccine offered (SD-IIV4 only); high-risk patients receiving HD-IIV3, others receiving SD-IIV3 (HD-IIV3 & SD-IIV3); and high-risk patients receiving HD-IIV3, others receiving SD-IIV4 (HD-IIV3 & SD-IIV4). In a secondary analysis, RIV replaced HD-IIV3. Parameters were obtained from U.S. databases, the medical literature and extrapolations from VE estimates. Effectiveness was measured as 3%\/year discounted quality adjusted life year (QALY) losses avoided.","522":"We observed several information gains from collecting modelled trajectories rather than quantile distributions, including potential for continuously updated information from a single model collection. The value of information gains and losses may vary with each collaborative effort's aims, depending on the needs of projection users. Understanding the differing information potential of methods to collect model projections can support the accuracy, sustainability, and communication of collaborative infectious disease modelling efforts.By collecting modelled trajectories, we showed policy-relevant epidemic characteristics. Trajectories contained a right-skewed distribution well represented by an ensemble of trajectories or a linear opinion pool, but not models' quantile intervals. Ensembles weighted by performance typically retained the range of plausible incidence over time, and in some cases narrowed this by excluding some epidemic shapes.We compared projections from the European COVID-19 Scenario Modelling Hub. Five teams modelled incidence in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Spain. We compared July 2022 projections by incidence, peaks, and cumulative totals. We created a probabilistic ensemble drawn from all trajectories, and compared to ensembles from a median across each model's quantiles, or a linear opinion pool. We measured the predictive accuracy of individual trajectories against observations, using this in a weighted ensemble. We repeated this sequentially against increasing weeks of observed data. We evaluated these ensembles to reflect performance with varying observed data.Collaborative comparisons and combinations of epidemic models are used as policy-relevant evidence during epidemic outbreaks. In the process of collecting multiple model projections, such collaborations may gain or lose relevant information. Typically, modellers contribute a probabilistic summary at each time-step. We compared this to directly collecting simulated trajectories. We aimed to explore information on key epidemic quantities; ensemble uncertainty; and performance against data, investigating potential to continuously gain information from a single cross-sectional collection of model results.","523":"Epidemiology computation models are crucial for the assessment and control of public health crises. Agent-based simulations of pandemic influenza forecast the infectious disease spreading in order to help public health policy makers during emergencies. In such emergencies, decisions are required for public health preparedness in cycles of less than a day, and the agent-based model should be adaptable and tractable for quick and simple calibration with low computational overhead. GPU accelerated computing involves the use of graphics processing units (GPUs) in combination with the CPU to perform heterogeneous computing by offloading compute-intensive portions of the program to the GPU while the remaining program runs on the CPU. In this paper, we demonstrate the utilization of the hardware environment and software tools and discuss strategies for porting agent-based simulations to multiple GPUs. We further compare the performance of simulations using two or four GPUs with the sequential execution on the CPU, in terms of time and speedup. The multi-GPU implementations exhibit great performance and support populations with up to 100 million individuals.","524":"EOT likely cannot be achieved for rHAT without control of wildlife reservoirs, however insecticide treatment of domestic animals holds promise for improved control. In the presence of domestic animal reservoirs, gHAT EOT may not be achieved under current control strategies.. To evaluate the utility of a One Health approach to gHAT and rHAT EOT, we built and parameterized a compartmental stochastic model, using the Institute for Disease Modeling's Compartmental Modeling Software, to six HAT epidemics: the national rHAT epidemics in Uganda and Malawi, the national gHAT epidemics in Uganda and South Sudan, and two separate gHAT epidemics in Democratic Republic of Congo distinguished by dominant vector species. In rHAT foci the reservoir animal sub-model was stratified on four species groups, while in gHAT foci domestic swine were assumed to be the only competent reservoir. The modeled time horizon was 2005-2045, with calibration performed using HAT surveillance data and Optuna. Interventions included insecticide and trypanocide treatment of domestic animal reservoirs at varying coverage levels.. Validation against HAT surveillance data indicates favorable performance overall, with the possible exception of DRC. EOT was not observed in any modeled scenarios for rHAT, however insecticide treatment consistently performed better than trypanocide treatment in terms of rHAT control. EOT was not observed for gHAT at 0% coverage of domestic reservoirs with trypanocides or insecticides, but was observed by 2030 in all test scenarios; again, insecticides demonstrated superior performance to trypanocides.. In response to large strides in the control of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), in the early 2000s the WHO set targets for elimination of both the gambiense (gHAT) and rhodesiense (rHAT) forms as a public health (EPHP) problem by 2020, and elimination of gHAT transmisson (EOT) by 2030. While global EPHP targets have been met, and EOT appears within reach, current control strategies may fail to achieve gHAT EOT in the presence of animal reservoirs, the role of which is currently uncertain. Furthermore, rHAT is not targeted for EOT due to the known importance of animal reservoirs for this form.","525":"The emergence of under-immunized clusters is a growing concern for public health agencies because they can act as reservoirs of infection and increase the risk of infection into the wider population. Higher resolution clusters computed using our network based approach and population models provide new insights on the structure and characteristics of such clusters and enable targeted interventions.We find 2 significant under-vaccinated clusters in MN and 3 in WA. These are very irregular in shape, in contrast to the circular disks reported in prior work, which rely on the SatScan approach. Some of the clusters found by our method are not contained in those computed using SatScan, a state-of-the-art software tool used in similar studies in other states.Clusters of under-vaccinated children are emerging in a number of states in the United States due to rising rates of vaccine hesitancy and refusal. As the measles outbreaks in California and other states in 2015 and in Minnesota in 2017 showed, such clusters can pose a significant public health risk. Prior methods have used publicly-available school immunization data for analysis (except for a few, which use private healthcare patient records). School immunization data has limited demographic information-as a result, such analyses are not able to provide demographic characteristics of significant clusters. Further, the resolution of the clusters identified by prior methods is limited since they are typically restricted to disks or well-rounded shapes.We use realistic population models for Minnesota (MN) and Washington (WA) state, which provide a model of activities for all individuals in the population. We combine this with school level immunization data for these two states, to estimate vaccine coverage at the level of census block groups. A scan statistic method defined on networks is used for finding significant clusters of under-immunized block groups, without any restrictions on shape. Further we provide the demographic characteristics of these clusters.","526":"A two-arm institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant prospective observational patient-reported outcomes study was performed from November 2017 to July 2018. Inclusion criteria were men with Gleason 6 prostate cancer in active surveillance undergoing either prostate mpMRI or transrectal prostate biopsy. A survey instrument was constructed using validated metrics in consultation with the local patient- and family-centered care organization. Study subjects were recruited at the time of diagnostic testing and completed the instrument by phone 24 to 72 hours after testing. The primary outcome measure was summary testing-related quality of life (summary utility score), derived from the testing morbidities index (TMI) (scale: 0\u00a0= death and 1\u00a0= perfect health). TMI is stratified into seven domains, with each domain scored from 1 (no health impact) to 5 (extreme health impact). Testing-related quality-of-life measures in the two cohorts were compared with Mann-Whitney U test.Transrectal prostate biopsy has greater temporary health impact (lower testing-related quality-of-life measure) than prostate mpMRI.In all, 122 subjects were recruited, and 90% (110 of 122 [MRI 55 of 60, biopsy 55 of 62]) successfully completed the survey instrument. The temporary quality-of-life impact of transrectal biopsy was significantly greater than that of prostate mpMRI (0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79-0.85, versus 0.95, 95% CI 0.94-0.97; P < .001). The largest mean domain-level difference was for intraprocedural pain (transrectal biopsy 2.6, 95% CI 2.4-2.8, versus mpMRI 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5; P < .001).To assess the temporary health impact of prostate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and transrectal prostate biopsy in an active surveillance prostate cancer population.","527":"Weather variables has been described as major drivers of vector proliferation and arbovirus transmission. Among them, temperature has consistently been found to be impactful in transmission dynamics, and models that incorporate temperature have been widely used to evaluate and forecast transmission or arboviruses like dengue, zika, or chikungunya virus. Further, there is growing evidence of the importance of micro-environmental temperatures in driving transmission of Aedes aegypti-borne viruses, as these mosquitoes tend to live within domiciles. Yet there is still a considerable gap in our understanding of how accounting for micro-environmental temperatures in models varies from the use of other widely-used, macro-level temperature measures. This effort combines field-collected data of both indoor and outdoor household associated temperatures and weather station temperature data from three Colombian cities to describe the relationship between the measures representing temperature at the micro- and macro-levels. These data indicate that weather station data may not accurately capture the temperature profiles of indoor micro-environments. However, using these data sources, the basic reproductive number for arboviruses was calculated by means of three modeling efforts to investigate whether temperature measure differences translated to differential transmission predictions. Across all three cities, it was determined that the modeling method was more often impactful rather than the temperature data-source, though no consistent pattern was immediately clear. This suggests that temperature data sources and modeling methods are important for precision in arbovirus transmission predictions, and more studies are needed to parse out this complex interaction.","528":"Student debt in the U.S. is at historically high levels and poses an excessive burden on medical graduates. Studies suggest that financial limitations dissuade some medical trainees from pursuing careers in infectious diseases (ID) and other cognitive specialties, despite their interest in the subject matter. Addressing student debt may have a transformative impact on ID recruitment, diversification of the ID workforce, and contributions of ID physicians to underserved public health needs. Relief of student debt also has the potential to narrow the racial wealth gap because non-white students are more likely to finance their post-secondary education, including medical school, with student loans, yet they have a lower earning potential following graduation. An executive order from the Biden-Harris administration announced in August 2022 presents a first step towards student debt relief, but the policy would need to be expanded in volume and scope to effectively achieve these goals.","529":"The last decade has witnessed very active development in two broad, but separate fields, both involving understanding and modeling of how individuals move in time and space (hereafter called \"travel behavior analysis\" or \"human mobility analysis\"). One field comprises transportation researchers who have been working in the field for decades and the other involves new comers from a wide range of disciplines, but primarily computer scientists and physicists. Researchers in these two fields work with different datasets, apply different methodologies, and answer different but overlapping questions. It is our view that there is much, hidden synergy between the two fields that needs to be brought out. It is thus the purpose of this paper to introduce datasets, concepts, knowledge and methods used in these two fields, and most importantly raise cross-discipline ideas for conversations and collaborations between the two. It is our hope that this paper will stimulate many future cross-cutting studies that involve researchers from both fields.","530":"Thailand has made substantial progress towards malaria elimination, with 46 of the country's 77 provinces declared malaria-free as part of the subnational verification program. Nonetheless, these areas remain vulnerable to the reintroduction of malaria parasites and the reestablishment of indigenous transmission. As such, prevention of reestablishment (POR) planning is of increasing concern to ensure timely response to increasing cases. A thorough understanding of both the risk of parasite importation and receptivity for transmission is essential for successful POR planning. Routine geolocated case- and foci-level epidemiological and case-level demographic data were extracted from Thailand's national malaria information system for all active foci from October 2012 to September 2020. A spatial analysis examined environmental and climate factors associated with the remaining active foci. A logistic regression model collated surveillance data with remote sensing data to investigate associations with the probability of having reported an indigenous case within the previous year. Active foci are highly concentrated along international borders, particularly Thailand's western border with Myanmar. Although there is heterogeneity in the habitats surrounding active foci, land covered by tropical forest and plantation was significantly higher for active foci than other foci. The regression results showed that tropical forest, plantations, forest disturbance, distance from international borders, historical foci classification, percentage of males, and percentage of short-term residents were associated with the high probability of reporting indigenous cases. These results confirm that Thailand's emphasis on border areas and forest-going populations is well placed. The results suggest that environmental factors alone are not driving malaria transmission in Thailand; rather, other factors, including demographics and behaviors that intersect with exophagic vectors, may also be contributors. However, these factors are syndemic, so human activities in areas covered by tropical forests and plantations may result in malaria importation and, potentially, local transmission, in foci that had previously been cleared. These factors should be addressed in POR planning.","531":"We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of five specific dental interventions to help guide resource allocation.We developed a spreadsheet-based tool, from the healthcare payer perspective, to evaluate the cost effectiveness of specific dental interventions that are currently used among Alaska Native children (6-60 months). Interventions included: water fluoridation, dental sealants, fluoride varnish, tooth brushing with fluoride toothpaste, and conducting initial dental exams on children <18 months of age. We calculated the cost-effectiveness ratio of implementing the proposed interventions to reduce the number of carious teeth and full mouth dental reconstructions (FMDRs) over 10 years.A total of 322 children received caries treatments completed by a dental provider in the dental chair, while 161 children received FMDRs completed by a dental surgeon in an operating room. The average cost of treating dental caries in the dental chair was $1,467 (\u223c258,000 per year); while the cost of treating FMDRs was $9,349 (\u223c1.5 million per year). All interventions were shown to prevent caries and FMDRs; however tooth brushing prevented the greatest number of caries at minimum and maximum effectiveness with 1,433 and 1,910, respectively. Tooth brushing also prevented the greatest number of FMDRs (159 and 211) at minimum and maximum effectiveness.All of the dental interventions evaluated were shown to produce cost savings. However, the level of that cost saving is dependent on the intervention chosen.","532":"This article describes the development process for a clinical laboratory information system (LIS) that leverages informatics interventions to address problems in the laboratory testing process at a hospital in a low-resource setting.Our experience highlights the potential of using informatics interventions to address systemic problems in the laboratory testing process in low-resource settings. Implementing these interventions may require innovation of new hardware to address various contextual issues. We strongly encourage thorough testing of such innovations to reduce the risk of failure when implemented.Reducing laboratory errors presents a significant opportunity for both cost reduction and healthcare quality improvement. This is particularly true in low-resource settings where laboratory errors are further exacerbated by poor infrastructure and shortages in a trained workforce. Informatics interventions can be used to address some of the sources of laboratory errors.We designed interventions using informatics methods for previously identified problems in the laboratory testing process at a clinical laboratory in a low-resource setting. First, we reviewed a pre-existing LIS functionality assessment toolkit and consulted with laboratory personnel. This provided requirements that were developed into a LIS with interventions designed to address the problems that had been identified. We piloted the LIS at the Kamuzu Central Hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi.We implemented a series of informatics interventions in the form of a LIS to address sources of laboratory errors and support the entire laboratory testing process. Custom hardware was built to support the ordering of laboratory tests and review of laboratory test results.","533":"Within-species variation is a salient feature of natural populations, of substantial importance for species interactions. However, the community consequences of sexual dimorphism, one of the most ubiquitous sources of within-species variance, remains poorly understood. Here, we extend classical models of consumer-resource dynamics to explore the ecological consequences of consumer sexual dimorphism. We show that sexual dimorphism in consumer attack rates on two different resource species promotes coexistence between those resources, mitigating the effects of both apparent competition and direct interspecific competition. Consumer sexual dimorphism can prevent exclusion of a resource with inferior growth rates because reduction in any of the two resources reduces consumer density, generating negative frequency dependence that stabilizes coexistence between resources. Our work highlights ecological sex differences as a potentially key factor governing the assembly of ecological communities, illustrating that the specific source of within-species variance can have important implications for community ecology.","534":" and Artemis for trimming the DNA ends; DNA polymerase \u03bc and \u03bb to add nucleotides; and the DNA ligase IV complex to ligate the ends with the additional factors, XRCC4 (X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 4), XLF (XRCC4-like factor\/Cernunos), and PAXX (paralog of XRCC4 and XLF). In vivo studies have demonstrated the degrees of importance of these NHEJ proteins in the mechanism of repair of dsDNA breaks, but interpretations can be confounded by other cellular processes. In vitro studies with NHEJ proteins have been performed to evaluate the nucleolytic resection, polymerization, and ligation steps, but a complete system has been elusive. Here we have developed a NHEJ reconstitution system that includes the nuclease, polymerase, and ligase components to evaluate relative NHEJ efficiency and analyze ligated junctional sequences for various types of DNA ends, including blunt, 5' overhangs, and 3' overhangs. We find that different dsDNA end structures have differential dependence on these enzymatic components. The dependence of some end joining on only Ku and XRCC4\u00b7DNA ligase IV allows us to formulate a physical model that incorporates nuclease and polymerase components as needed.","535":"Seventeen percent (2016 RAMS), 10% (2017 RAMS), 6% (RIYRBS) and 11% (NYRBS) of students reported ever using prescription pain reliever without a physician prescription.

The use of chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) as a means of decolonizingpatients, either through targeted decolonization or daily bathing, is frequently used to supplementother interventions. We explore the potential of a long-acting disinfectant with a persistent effect,immediate decolonizing action in the prevention of MRSA acquisition, and clinical illness andmortality in an 18-bed intensive care unit, based on a previous model. A scenario with nointervention is compared to CHG bathing, which decolonizes patients but provides no additionalprotection, and a hypothetical treatment that both decolonizes them and provides protection fromsubsequent colonization. The duration and effectiveness of this protection is varied to fully explorethe potential utility of such a treatment. Increasing the effectiveness of the decolonizing agentreduces colonization, with a 10% increase resulting in a colonization rate ratio (RR) of 0.89 (95% CI:0.89,0.90). Increasing the duration of protection results in a much more modest reduction, with a 12-hour increase in protection resulting in an RR of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.99, 0.99). There is little evidence ofsynergy between the two.","537":"Variation in male nuptial colour signals might be maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection. This can occur if males are more aggressive towards rivals with locally common colour phenotypes. To test this hypothesis, we introduced red or melanic three-dimensional printed-model males into the territories of nesting male stickleback from two optically distinct lakes with different coloured residents. Red-throated models were attacked more in the population with red males, while melanic models were attacked more in the melanic male lake. Aggression against red versus melanic models also varied across a depth gradient within each lake, implying that the local light environment also modulated the strength of negative frequency dependence acting on male nuptial colour.","538":"Hong Kong has implemented stringent public health and social measures (PHSMs) to curb each of the four COVID-19 epidemic waves since January 2020. The third wave between July and September 2020 was brought under control within 2 m, while the fourth wave starting from the end of October 2020 has taken longer to bring under control and lasted at least 5 mo. Here, we report the pandemic fatigue as one of the potential reasons for the reduced impact of PHSMs on transmission in the fourth wave. We contacted either 500 or 1,000 local residents through weekly random-digit dialing of landlines and mobile telephones from May 2020 to February 2021. We analyze the epidemiological impact of pandemic fatigue by using the large and detailed cross-sectional telephone surveys to quantify risk perception and self-reported protective behaviors and mathematical models to incorporate population protective behaviors. Our retrospective prediction suggests that an increase of 100 daily new reported cases would lead to 6.60% (95% CI: 4.03, 9.17) more people worrying about being infected, increase 3.77% (95% CI: 2.46, 5.09) more people to avoid social gatherings, and reduce the weekly mean reproduction number by 0.32 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.44). Accordingly, the fourth wave would have been 14% (95% CI%: -53%, 81%) smaller if not for pandemic fatigue. This indicates the important role of mitigating pandemic fatigue in maintaining population protective behaviors for controlling COVID-19.","539":" and is characterized by the development of granulomatous lesions in the lymph nodes, lungs and other tissues. It poses serious public health impacts and food security challenges to the agricultural sector in terms of dairy and meat productions. In Ethiopia, BTB has been considered as a priority disease because of its high prevalence in urban and peri-urban dairy farms. However, there has not been any national control program in the country. Thus, in order to initiate BTB control program in the country, information on control options is needed to tailor the best option for the Ethiopian situation. The objective of this study was to identify, evaluate and rank various BTB control options in Ethiopia using a multi-criteria decision analysis based on preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE) approach while accounting for the stakeholders' preferences. Control options were evaluated under two scenarios: with (scenario 1) and without (scenario 2) bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination. Nine potential control options were identified that include combinations of three control options (1) test and slaughter with or without government support, (2) test and segregation, and (3) BCG vaccination. Under scenario 1, BCG vaccination, BCG vaccination and test and slaughter with partial compensation by government, and BCG vaccination and test and slaughter with full compensation by government were the top three ranked control options. Under scenario 2, test and slaughter with full compensation by government was the preferred control option, followed by test and segregation supported by test and slaughter with full government compensation, and test and slaughter with half compensation by government. Irrespective of the variability in the weighting by the stakeholders, the sensitivity analysis showed the robustness of the ranking method. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that BCG vaccination, and test and slaughter with full compensation by government were the two most preferred control options under scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. National level discussions were strongly recommended for further concretization and implementation of these control measures.","540":"Identifying vital nodes in networks exhibiting a community structure is a fundamental issue. Indeed, community structure is one of the main properties of real-world networks. Recent works have shown that community-aware centrality measures compare favorably with classical measures agnostic about this ubiquitous property. Nonetheless, there is no clear consensus about how they relate and in which situation it is better to use a classical or a community-aware centrality measure. To this end, in this paper, we perform an extensive investigation to get a better understanding of the relationship between classical and community-aware centrality measures reported in the literature. Experiments use artificial networks with controlled community structure properties and a large sample of real-world networks originating from various domains. Results indicate that the stronger the community structure, the more appropriate the community-aware centrality measures. Furthermore, variations of the degree and community size distribution parameters do not affect the results. Finally, network transitivity and community structure strength are the most significant drivers controlling the interactions between classical and community-aware centrality measures.","541":". Together, our analyses provide a holistic view of the diverse players in the low oxygen nitrogen cycle.","542":"Complex networks are characterized by latent geometries induced by their topology or by the dynamics on them. In the latter case, different network-driven processes induce distinct geometric features that can be captured by adequate metrics. Random walks, a proxy for a broad spectrum of processes, from simple contagion to metastable synchronization and consensus, have been recently used, Domenico [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 168301 (2017)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103\/PhysRevLett.118.168301] to define the class of diffusion geometries and pinpoint the functional mesoscale organization of complex networks from a genuine geometric perspective. Here we first extend this class to families of distinct random walk dynamics-including local and nonlocal information-on multilayer networks-a paradigm for biological, neural, social, transportation, and financial systems-overcoming limitations such as the presence of isolated nodes and disconnected components, typical of real-world networks. We then characterize the multilayer diffusion geometry of synthetic and empirical systems, highlighting the role played by different random search dynamics in shaping the geometric features of the corresponding diffusion manifolds.","543":"We found that proximity between hospitals is associated with higher volumes of shared admissions.Data were from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's State Inpatient Databases (Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Utah [2017], New York, Vermont [2016]) and the American Hospital Association Annual Survey (2016 & 2017). This was a cross-sectional analysis of patients who had an index admission and subsequent readmission at different hospitals within the same year. We used unadjusted and adjusted linear regression to evaluate the association between the number of shared patients and the distance between admission-readmission hospital pairs.There were 691 hospitals in the sample (247 in Florida, 151 in Georgia, 50 in Maryland, 172 in New York, 58 in Utah, and 13 in Vermont), accounting for a total of 596,772 admission-readmission pairs. 32.6% of the admission-readmission pairs were shared between two hospitals. On average, a one-mile decrease in distance between two hospitals was associated with of 3.05 (95% CI, 3.02, 3.07) more shared admissions. However, variability between states was wide, with Utah having 0.37 (95% CI 0.35, 0.39) more shared admissions between hospitals per one-mile shorter distance, and Maryland having 4.98 (95% CI 4.87, 5.08) more.To assess whether decreasing distance between hospitals was associated with the number of shared patients (patients with an admission to one hospital and a readmission to another).","544":"Recent evidence suggests that sexual contact may give rise to transmission of Ebola virus long after infection has been cleared from blood. We develop a simple mathematical model that incorporates contact transmission and sexual transmission parametrized from data relating to the 2013-2015 West African Ebola epidemic. The model explores scenarios where contact transmission is reduced following infection events, capturing behaviour change, and quantifies how these actions reducing transmission may be compromised by sexual transmission in terms of increasing likelihood, size and duration of outbreaks. We characterize the extent to which sexual transmission operates in terms of the probability of initial infection resolving to sexual infectiousness and the sexual transmission rate, and relate these parameters to the overall case burden. We find that sexual transmission can have large effects on epidemic dynamics (increasing attack ratios from 25% in scenarios without sexual transmission but with contact-transmission-reducing behaviour, up to 80% in equivalent scenarios with sexual transmission).","545":"Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registries provides information about survival duration and cause of death for cancer patients. Baseline demographic and tumor characteristics such as age, sex, race, year of diagnosis, and tumor stage can inform the expected survival time of patients, but their associations with survival may not be constant over the post-diagnosis period.Using SEER data, we examined if there were time-varying associations of patient and tumor characteristics on survival, and we assessed how these relationships differed across 14 cancer sites. Standard Cox proportional hazards models were extended to allow for time-varying associations and incorporated into a competing-risks framework, separately modeling cancer-specific and other-cause deaths. For each cancer site and for each of the five factors, we estimated the relative hazard ratio and absolute hazard over time in the presence of competing risks.Our comprehensive consideration of patient and tumor characteristics when estimating time-varying hazards showed that the associations of age, tumor stage at diagnosis, and race\/ethnicity with risk of death (cancer-specific and other-cause) change over time for many cancers; characteristics of sex and year of diagnosis exhibit some time-varying patterns as well. Stage at diagnosis had the largest associations with survival.These findings suggest that proportional hazards assumptions are often violated when examining patient characteristics on cancer survival post-diagnosis. We discuss several interesting results where the relative hazards are time-varying and suggest possible interpretations. Based on the time-varying associations of several important covariates on survival after cancer diagnosis using a pan-cancer approach, the likelihood of the proportional hazards assumption being met or corresponding interpretation should be considered in survival analyses, as flawed inference may have implications for cancer care and policy.","546":"Overall, 17.5 % (195) of the potential larval habitats were found positive for different Anopheles species. A total of 1683 larvae were identified belonging to seven species: Anopheles albimanus, Anopheles calderoni, Anopheles darlingi, Anopheles neomaculipalpus, Anopheles nuneztovari s.l., Anopheles pseudopunctipennis, and Anopheles triannulatus. The most widely distributed species was An. nuneztovari s.l., which was found mainly in human-made fishponds in Cordoba and temporary puddles in Valle del Cauca. Anopheles albimanus and An. calderoni were associated with human-made wells or excavation sites in Nari\u00f1o. Cordoba displayed the greatest Anopheles species diversity with a total of six species (Shannon diversity index H': 1.063). Although Valle del Cauca had four species, one more than Nari\u00f1o, the diversity was lower because only one species predominated, An. nuneztovari s.l. The larval habitats with the highest Shannon diversity index were lagoons (H': 1.079) and fishponds (H': 1.009) in Cordoba, excavation sites in Nari\u00f1o (H': 0.620) and puddles in Valle del Cauca (H': 0.764).Malaria incidence has recently decreased globally and, as malaria elimination is envisioned as a possibility by the health authorities, guidance is needed to strengthen malaria control strategies. Larval source treatment, which could complement routine vector control strategies, requires knowledge regarding the Anopheles larval habitats.This study provides important information regarding the larval habitats of the main malaria vectors in the most malaria-endemic regions of Colombia, which will be useful in guiding larval control operations.A cross-sectional study was conducted in three of the most malaria-endemic regions in Colombia. A total of 1116 potential larval habitats in 70 villages were sampled in three states located in western Colombia: Cordoba, Valle del Cauca and Nari\u00f1o.","547":"To estimate the association of age with the likelihood of developing symptoms and the association of age with the likelihood of progressing to critical illness after SARS-CoV-2 infection.Close contact with individuals with confirmed COVID-19 cases as identified by contact tracing operations.In total, 5484 case contacts (median [interquartile range] age, 50 [30-61] years; 3086 female contacts [56.3%]) were analyzed, 2824 of whom (51.5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (median [interquartile range] age, 53 [34-64] years; 1604 female contacts [56.8%]). The proportion of infected persons who developed symptoms ranged from 18.1% (95% CI, 13.9%-22.9%) among participants younger than 20 years to 64.6% (95% CI, 56.6%-72.0%) for those aged 80 years or older. Most infected contacts (1948 of 2824 individuals [69.0%]) did not develop respiratory symptoms or fever greater than or equal to 37.5 \u00b0C. Only 26.1% (95% CI, 24.1%-28.2%) of infected individuals younger than 60 years developed respiratory symptoms or fever greater than or equal to 37.5 \u00b0C; among infected participants older than 60 years, 6.6% (95% CI, 5.1%-8.3%) developed critical disease. Female patients were 52.7% (95% CI, 24.4%-70.7%) less likely than male patients to develop critical disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection.In this Italian cohort study of close contacts of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, more than one-half of individuals tested positive for the virus. However, most infected individuals did not develop respiratory symptoms or fever. The low proportion of children and young adults who developed symptoms highlights the possible challenges in readily identifying SARS-CoV-2 infections.This cohort study analyzed quarantined case contacts, identified between February 20 and April 16, 2020, in the Lombardy region of Italy. Contacts were monitored daily for symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, by either real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using nasopharyngeal swabs or retrospectively via IgG serological assays. Close contacts of individuals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were selected as those belonging to clusters (ie, groups of contacts associated with an index case) where all individuals were followed up for symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data were analyzed from February to June 2020.Age-specific estimates of the risk of developing respiratory symptoms or fever greater than or equal to 37.5 \u00b0C and of experiencing critical disease (defined as requiring intensive care or resulting in death) in SARS-CoV-2-infected case contacts.Solid estimates of the risk of developing symptoms and of progressing to critical disease in individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are key to interpreting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) dynamics, identifying the settings and the segments of the population where transmission is more likely to remain undetected, and defining effective control strategies.","548":"Clade X was a day-long pandemic tabletop exercise conducted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security on May 15, 2018, in Washington, DC.

We estimated the proportion of respondents with access to free safer smoking equipment, and among these participants, the proportion who reported that this access reduced their injection frequency. Among respondents without access to free safer smoking equipment, we described the proportion who were interested in getting access, and whether they thought this access would reduce their injection frequency.Among participants who reported prior year heroin (n\u00a0=\u00a0495), methamphetamine (n\u00a0=\u00a0372), or crack (n\u00a0=\u00a088) injection, 11%, 11% and 12% reported access to free safer smoking equipment, respectively. Of those with access, the proportion that reported that access reduced their injection frequency ranged from 12% to 44%. Among participants without access, 28% who used heroin, 45% who used methamphetamine, and 49% who used crack were interested in access. Of interested participants, a majority reported that they thought this access would reduce their frequency of injection.Drug use route transition interventions promote safer consumption by facilitating a switch from injection to safer routes such as smoking or oral consumption.Access to free safer smoking equipment was limited. Many participants were interested in getting free safer smoking equipment and reported that this access may reduce their injection frequency. Safer smoking equipment is a harm reduction strategy that should be available to reduce risks from opioid and stimulant injection.","550":"Following the emergence of Zika in the past decade, there are lessons to be learned from similar emergence events of dengue (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV). Specifically, as Zika emerges in the Americas there is a natural tendency to apply the knowledge base of DENV and CHIKV to mitigation and control of a virus with such a similar transmission system. However, there are marked differences that may preclude such broad stroke application of this knowledge base without making potentially faulty assumptions. Herein, Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission is reviewed, and the commonalities among these three arboviruses are discussed. Importantly, the divergence of this particular arbovirus is discussed, as is the need to develop ZIKV-specific knowledge base for mitigation of this disease. Specifically reviewed are 1) emergence and persistence patterns, 2) genetic and phenotypic diversity, 3) vector host range, and finally, 4) alternate transmission routes and added complexity of ZIKV transmission and presentation.","551":"2912 participants completed the survey and 4 FGDs were conducted in each country. Incorporating participants' perspectives, CS is defined as the practice of active public participation, collaboration and communication in all aspects of scientific research to increase public knowledge, create awareness, build trust and facilitate information flow between citizens, governments and scientists. In Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Philippines, Cameroon and Kenya, majority were unaware of outbreak-related CS. In India and Uganda, majority were aware but unengaged, while in Nepal and Zimbabwe, majority participated in CS before. Engagement approaches should consider different social and cultural contexts, while addressing incentivisation, attitudes and practicality factors. Overall, 76.0% expressed interest in digital CS but needed training to build skills and confidence. Digital CS was perceived as convenient, safer for outbreak-related activities and producing better quality and quantity of data. However, there were concerns over non-inclusion of certain groups, data security and unclear communication.Citizen science (CS) is an emerging approach in public health to harness the collective intelligence of individuals to augment traditional scientific efforts. However, citizens' viewpoint, especially the hard-to-reach population, is lacking in current outbreak-related literature. We aim to understand the awareness, readiness and feasibility of outbreak-related CS, including digitally enabled CS, in low-income and middle-income countries.CS interventions need to be relatable and address context-specific factors influencing CS participation. Digital CS has the potential to facilitate collaboration, but capacity and access issues must be considered to ensure inclusive and sustainable engagement.This mixed-method study was conducted in nine countries between October 2022 and June 2023. Recruitment through civil society targeted the general population, marginalised\/indigenous groups, youth and community health workers. Participants (aged \u226518 years) completed a quantitative survey, and a subset participated in focus group discussions (FGDs).","552":"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) continue to present a complex and costly challenge to public health programs. The preferences and social dynamics of a population can have a large impact on the course of an outbreak as well as the effectiveness of interventions intended to influence individual behavior. In addition, individuals may alter their sexual behavior in response to the presence of STIs, creating a feedback loop between transmission and behavior. We investigate the consequences of modeling the interaction between STI transmission and prophylactic use with a model that links a Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) system to evolutionary game dynamics that determine the effective contact rate. The combined model framework allows us to address protective behavior by both infected and susceptible individuals. Feedback between behavioral adaptation and prevalence creates a wide range of dynamic behaviors in the combined model, including damped and sustained oscillations as well as bistability, depending on the behavioral parameters and disease growth rate. We found that disease extinction is possible for multiple regions where R0>1, due to behavior adaptation driving the epidemic downward, although conversely endemic prevalence for arbitrarily low R0 is also possible if contact rates are sufficiently high. We also tested how model misspecification might affect disease forecasting and estimation of the model parameters and R0. We found that alternative models that neglect the behavioral feedback or only consider behavior adaptation by susceptible individuals can potentially yield misleading parameter estimates or omit significant features of the disease trajectory. ","553":"Neutralizing antibodies are important correlates of protection against dengue. Yet, determinants of variation in neutralization across strains within the four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1-4) is imperfectly understood. Studies focus on structural DENV proteins, especially the envelope (E), the primary target of anti-DENV antibodies. Although changes in immune recognition (antigenicity) are often attributed to variation in epitope residues, viral processes influencing conformation and epitope accessibility also affect neutralizability, suggesting possible modulating roles of nonstructural proteins. We estimated effects of residue changes in all 10 DENV proteins on antigenic distances between 348 DENV collected from individuals living in Bangkok, Thailand (1994-2014). Antigenic distances were derived from response of each virus to a panel of twenty non-human primate antisera. Across 100 estimations, excluding 10% of virus pairs each time, 77 of 295 positions with residue variability in E consistently conferred antigenic effects; 52 were within \u00b13 sites of known binding sites of neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies, exceeding expectations from random assignments of effects to sites (p = 0.037). Effects were also identified for 16 sites on the stem\/anchor of E which were only recently shown to become exposed under physiological conditions. For all proteins, except nonstructural protein 2A (NS2A), root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) in predicting distances between pairs held out in each estimation did not outperform sequences of equal length derived from all proteins or E, suggesting that antigenic signals present were likely through linkage with E. Adjusted for E, we identified 62\/219 sites embedding the excess signals in NS2A. Concatenating these sites to E additionally explained 3.4% to 4.0% of observed variance in antigenic distances from when E alone (50.5% to 50.8%); RMSE outperformed concatenating E with sites from any protein of the virus (\u0394RMSE, 95%IQR: 0.01, 0.05). Our results support examining antigenic determinants beyond the DENV surface.","554":"Depending on the correlation between condom use and the existence of concurrency, association between the proportion of people with multiple partners and the reproduction number can be reversed, suggesting the sexually active population is not necessary a primary target population to encourage condom use (i.e., sexually less active individuals could equivalently be a target in some cases).The definition of sexual contact pattern can be broad, but we focus on two specific aspects: (i) type of partnership (i.e. steady or casual partnership) and (ii) existence of concurrency (i.e. with single or multiple partners). Systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies are performed, analysing literature that epidemiologically examined the relationship between condom use and sexual contact pattern. Subsequently, we employ an epidemiological model and compute the reproduction number that accounts for with and without concurrency so that the corresponding coverage of condom use and its correlation with existence of concurrency can be explicitly investigated using the mathematical model. Combining the model with parameters estimated from the meta-analysis along with other assumed parameters, the impact of varying the proportion of population with multiple partners on the reproduction number is examined.Based on systematic review, we show that a greater number of people used condoms during sexual contact with casual partners than with steady partners. Furthermore, people with multiple partners use condoms more frequently than people with a single partner alone. Our mathematical model revealed a positive relationship between the effective reproduction number and the proportion of people with multiple partners. Nevertheless, the association was reversed to be negative by employing a slightly greater value of the relative risk of condom use for people with multiple partners than that empirically estimated.It is believed that sexually active people, i.e. people having multiple or concurrent sexual partners, are at a high risk of sexually transmitted infections (STI), but they are likely to be more aware of the risk and may exhibit greater fraction of the use of condom. The purpose of the present study is to examine the correlation between condom use and sexual contact pattern and clarify its impact on the transmission dynamics of STIs using a mathematical model.","555":"The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected some communities and populations more than others. We propose that an interdisciplinary framework of 'One Health Disparities' advances understanding of the social and systemic issues that drive COVID-19 in vulnerable populations. One Health Disparities integrates the social environment with One Health perspectives on the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. To apply this framework, we consider One Health Disparities that emerge in three key components of disease transmission: exposure, susceptibility, and disease expression. Exposure disparities arise through variation in contact with COVID-19's causative agent, SARS-CoV-2. Disparities in susceptibility and disease expression also exist; these are driven by biological and social factors, such as diabetes and obesity, and through variation in access to healthcare. We close by considering how One Health Disparities informs understanding of spillback into new animal reservoirs, and what this might mean for further human health disparities.One Health focuses on interconnections between human, animal, and environmental health. We propose that social environments are also important to One Health and help illuminate disparities in the coronavirus pandemic, including its origins, transmission and susceptibility among humans, and spillback to other species. We call this framework One Health Disparities.","556":"Sequencing pathogen samples during a communicable disease outbreak is becoming an increasingly common procedure in epidemiologic investigations. Identifying who infected whom sheds considerable light on transmission patterns, high-risk settings and subpopulations, and the effectiveness of infection control. Genomic data shed new light on transmission dynamics and can be used to identify clusters of individuals likely to be linked by direct transmission. However, identification of individual routes of infection via single genome samples typically remains uncertain. We investigated the potential of deep sequence data to provide greater resolution on transmission routes, via the identification of shared genomic variants. We assessed several easily implemented methods to identify transmission routes using both shared variants and genetic distance, demonstrating that shared variants can provide considerable additional information in most scenarios. While shared-variant approaches identify relatively few links in the presence of a small transmission bottleneck, these links are highly accurate. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid approach that also incorporates phylogenetic distance to provide greater resolution. We applied our methods to data collected during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, identifying several likely routes of transmission. Our study highlights the power of data from deep sequencing of pathogens as a component of outbreak investigation and epidemiologic analyses.","557":"Understanding tick-transmitted pathogens in tick infested areas is crucial for the development of preventive and control measures in response to the increasing cases of tick-borne diseases. A stochastic model for the dynamics of two pathogens, Rickettsia parkeri and Rickettsia amblyommii, in a single tick, Amblyomma americanum, is developed and analysed. The model, a continuous-time Markov chain, is based on a deterministic tick-borne disease model. The extinction threshold for the stochastic model is computed using the multitype branching process and conditions for pathogen extinction or persistence are presented. The probability of pathogen extinction is computed using numerical simulations and is shown to be a good estimate of the probability of extinction calculated from the branching process. A sensitivity analysis is undertaken to illustrate the relationship between co-feeding and transovarial transmission rates and the probability of pathogen extinction. Expected epidemic duration is estimated using sample paths and we show that R. amblyommii is likely to persist slightly longer than R. parkeri. Further, we estimate the duration of possible coexistence of the two pathogens.","558":"We examine how spatial heterogeneity combines with mobility network structure to influence vector-borne disease dynamics. Specifically, we consider a Ross-Macdonald-type disease model on n spatial locations that are coupled by host movement on a strongly connected, weighted, directed graph. We derive a closed form approximation to the domain reproduction number using a Laurent series expansion, and use this approximation to compute sensitivities of the basic reproduction number to model parameters. To illustrate how these results can be used to help inform mitigation strategies, as a case study we apply these results to malaria dynamics in Namibia, using published cell phone data and estimates for local disease transmission. Our analytical results are particularly useful for understanding drivers of transmission when mobility sinks and transmission hot spots do not coincide.","559":"A fundamental question of any program focused on the testing and timely diagnosis of a communicable disease is its effectiveness in reducing transmission. Here, we introduce testing effectiveness (TE)-the fraction by which testing and post-diagnosis isolation reduce transmission at the population scale-and a model that incorporates test specifications and usage, within-host pathogen dynamics, and human behaviors to estimate TE. Using TE to guide recommendations, we show that today's rapid diagnostics should be used immediately upon symptom onset to control influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus but delayed by up to two days to control omicron-era severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Furthermore, while rapid tests are superior to reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to control founder-strain SARS-CoV-2, omicron-era changes in viral kinetics and rapid test sensitivity cause a reversal, with higher TE for RT-qPCR despite longer turnaround times. Last, we illustrate the model's flexibility by quantifying trade-offs in the use of post-diagnosis testing to shorten isolation times.","560":"White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an emerging infectious disease that has resulted in severe declines of its hibernating bat hosts in North America. The ongoing epidemic of white-nose syndrome is a multi-scale phenomenon becau.se it causes hibernaculum-level extirpations, while simultaneously spreading over larger spatial scales. We investigate a neglected topic in ecological epidemiology: how local pathogen-driven extirpations impact large-scale pathogen spread. Previous studies have identified risk factors for propagation of WNS over hibernaculum and landscape scales but none of these have tested the hypothesis that separation of spatial scales and disease-induced mortality at the hibernaculum level might slow or halt its spread. To test this hypothesis, we developed a mechanistic multi-scale model parameterized using white-nose syndrome.county and site incidence data that connects hibernaculum-level susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) epidemiology to the county-scale contagion process. Our key result is that hibernaculum-level extirpations will not inhibit county-scale spread of WNS. We show that over 80% of counties of the contiguous USA are likely to become infected before the current epidemic is over and that geometry of habitat connectivity is such that host refuges are exceedingly rare. The macroscale spatiotemporal infection pattern that emerges from local SIR epidemiological processes falls within a narrow spectrum of possible outcomes, suggesting that recolonization, rescue effects, and multi-host complexities at local scales are not important to forward propagation of WNS at large spatial scales. If effective control measures are not implemented, precipitous declines in bat populations are likely, particularly in cave-dense regions that constitute the main geographic corridors of the USA, a serious concern for bat conservation.","561":"For vector-borne diseases the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text], a measure of a disease's epidemic potential, is highly temperature-dependent. Recent work characterizing these temperature dependencies has highlighted how climate change may impact geographic disease spread. We extend this prior work by examining how newly emerging diseases, like Zika, will be impacted by specific future climate change scenarios in four diverse regions of Brazil, a country that has been profoundly impacted by Zika. We estimated a [Formula: see text], derived from a compartmental transmission model, characterizing Zika (and, for comparison, dengue) transmission potential as a function of temperature-dependent biological parameters specific to Aedes aegypti. We obtained historical temperature data for the five-year period 2015-2019 and projections for 2045-2049 by fitting cubic spline interpolations to data from simulated atmospheric data provided by the CMIP-6 project (specifically, generated by the GFDL-ESM4 model), which provides projections under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP). These four SSP scenarios correspond to varying levels of climate change severity. We applied this approach to four Brazilian cities (Manaus, Recife, Rio de Janeiro, and S\u00e3o Paulo) that represent diverse climatic regions. Our model predicts that the [Formula: see text] for Zika peaks at 2.7 around 30\u00b0C, while for dengue it peaks at 6.8 around 31\u00b0C. We find that the epidemic potential of Zika will increase beyond current levels in Brazil in all of the climate scenarios. For Manaus, we predict that the annual [Formula: see text] range will increase from 2.1-2.5, to 2.3-2.7, for Recife we project an increase from 0.4-1.9 to 0.6-2.3, for Rio de Janeiro from 0-1.9 to 0-2.3, and for S\u00e3o Paulo from 0-0.3 to 0-0.7. As Zika immunity wanes and temperatures increase, there will be increasing epidemic potential and longer transmission seasons, especially in regions where transmission is currently marginal. Surveillance systems should be implemented and sustained for early detection.","562":"The statistical inference of high-order Markov chains (MCs) for biological sequences is vital for molecular sequence analyses but can be hindered by the high dimensionality of free parameters. In the seminal article by B\u00fchlmann and Wyner, variable length Markov chain (VLMC) model was proposed to embed the full-order MC in a sparse structured context tree. In the key procedure of tree pruning of their proposed context algorithm, the word count-based statistic for each branch was defined and compared with a fixed cutoff threshold calculated from a common chi-square distribution to prune the branch of the context tree. In this study, we find that the word counts for each branch are highly intercorrelated, resulting in non-negligible effects on the distribution of the statistic of interest. We demonstrate that the inferred context tree based on the original context algorithm by B\u00fchlmann and Wyner, which uses a fixed cutoff threshold based on a common chi-square distribution, can be systematically biased and error prone. We denote the original context algorithm as VLMC-Biased (VLMC-B). To solve this problem, we propose a new context tree inference algorithm using an adaptive tree-pruning scheme, termed VLMC-Consistent (VLMC-C). The VLMC-C is founded on the consistent branch-specific mixed chi-square distributions calculated based on asymptotic normal distribution of multiple word patterns. We validate our theoretical branch-specific asymptotic distribution using simulated data. We compare VLMC-C with VLMC-B on context tree inference using both simulated and real genome sequence data and demonstrate that VLMC-C outperforms VLMC-B for both context tree reconstruction accuracy and model compression capacity.","563":"Social media research during natural disasters has been presented as a tool to guide response and relief efforts in the disciplines of geography and computer sciences. This systematic review highlights the public health implications of social media use in the response phase of the emergency, assessing (1) how social media can improve the dissemination of emergency warning and response information during and after a natural disaster, and (2) how social media can help identify physical, medical, functional, and emotional needs after a natural disaster. We surveyed the literature using 3 databases and included 44 research articles. We found that analyses of social media data were performed using a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Social media platforms were identified as broadcasting tools presenting an opportunity for public health agencies to share emergency warnings. Social media was used as a tool to identify areas in need of relief operations or medical assistance by using self-reported location, with map development as a common method to visualize data. In retrospective analyses, social media analysis showed promise as an opportunity to reduce the time of response and to identify the individuals' location. Further research for misinformation and rumor control using social media is needed.","564":"We obtained daily resident-level data for all California state prisons from Jan 1, 2020, to May 15, 2021, describing prison layouts, housing status, sociodemographic and health characteristics, participation in activities, and COVID-19 testing, infection, and vaccination status. We developed a transmission-dynamic stochastic microsimulation parameterised by the California data and published literature. After an initial infection is introduced to a prison, the model evaluates the effect of various policy scenarios on infections and hospitalisations over 200 days. Scenarios vary by vaccine coverage, baseline immunity (0%, 25%, or 50%), resumption of activities, and use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that reduce transmission by 75%. We simulated five prison types that differ by residential layout and demographics, and estimated outcomes with and without repeated infection introductions over the 200 days.Residents of prisons have experienced disproportionate COVID-19-related health harms. To control outbreaks, many prisons in the USA restricted in-person activities, which are now resuming even as viral variants proliferate. This study aims to use mathematical modelling to assess the risks and harms of COVID-19 outbreaks in prisons under a range of policies, including resumption of activities.If a viral variant is introduced into a prison that has resumed pre-2020 contact levels, has moderate vaccine coverage (ranging from 36% to 76% among residents, dependent on age, with 40% coverage for staff), and has no baseline immunity, 23-74% of residents are expected to be infected over 200 days. High vaccination coverage (90%) coupled with NPIs reduces cumulative infections to 2-54%. Even in prisons with low room occupancies (ie, no more than two occupants) and low levels of cumulative infections (ie, 20% of residents infected) are substantially higher if infections are repeatedly introduced.Horowitz Family Foundation, National Institute on Drug Abuse, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Science Foundation, Open Society Foundation, Advanced Micro Devices.Balancing benefits of resuming activities against risks of outbreaks presents challenging trade-offs. After achieving high vaccine coverage, prisons with mostly one-to-two-person cells that have higher baseline immunity from previous outbreaks can resume in-person activities with low risk of a widespread new outbreak, provided they maintain widespread NPIs, continue testing, and take measures to protect the medically vulnerable.","565":"None.Understanding how environmental factors affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission could inform global containment efforts. Despite high scientific and public interest and multiple research reports, there is currently no consensus on the association of environmental factors and SARS-CoV-2 transmission. To address this research gap, we aimed to assess the relative risk of transmission associated with weather conditions and ambient air pollution.Warmer temperature and moderate outdoor ultraviolet exposure result in a slight reduction in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2; however, changes in weather or air pollution alone are not enough to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 with other factors having greater effects.Our dataset included data collected between Dec 12, 2019, and April 22, 2020. Several weather variables and ambient air pollution were associated with the spread of SARS-CoV-2 across 3739 global locations. We found a moderate, negative relationship between the estimated reproduction number and temperatures warmer than 25\u00b0C (a decrease of 3\u00b77% [95% CI 1\u00b79-5\u00b74] per additional degree), a U-shaped relationship with outdoor ultraviolet exposure, and weaker positive associations with air pressure, wind speed, precipitation, diurnal temperature, sulphur dioxide, and ozone. Results were robust to multiple assumptions. Independent research building on our estimates provides strong support for the resulting projections across nations.In this global analysis, we adjusted for the delay between infection and detection, estimated the daily reproduction number at 3739 global locations during the COVID-19 pandemic up until late April, 2020, and investigated its associations with daily local weather conditions (ie, temperature, humidity, precipitation, snowfall, moon illumination, sunlight hours, ultraviolet index, cloud cover, wind speed and direction, and pressure data) and ambient air pollution (ie, PM2\u00b75, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and sulphur dioxide). To account for other confounding factors, we included both location-specific fixed effects and trends, controlling for between-location differences and heterogeneities in locations' responses over time. We built confidence in our estimations through synthetic data, robustness, and sensitivity analyses, and provided year-round global projections for weather-related risk of global SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","566":"To estimate the level and duration of OCV efficacy, we re-analyzed data from a previously published cluster-randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial with five years of follow-up. We used a Cox proportional hazards model and modeled the potentially time-dependent effect of age categories on both vaccine efficacy and risk of infection in the placebo group. In addition, we investigated the impact of an outbreak period on model estimation.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00289224.Oral cholera vaccine (OCV) is a feasible tool to prevent or mitigate cholera outbreaks. A better understanding of the vaccine's efficacy among different age groups and how rapidly its protection wanes could help guide vaccination policy.Vaccine efficacy was 38% (95% CI: -2%,62%) for those vaccinated from ages 1 to under 5 years old, 85% (95% CI: 67%,93%) for those 5 to under 15 years, and 69% (95% CI: 49%,81%) for those vaccinated at ages 15 years and older. Among adult vaccinees, efficacy did not appear to wane during the trial, but there was insufficient data to assess the waning of efficacy among child vaccinees.Through this re-analysis we were able to detect a statistically significant difference in OCV efficacy when the vaccine was administered to children under 5 years old vs. children 5 years and older. The estimated efficacies are more similar to the previously published analysis based on the first two years of follow-up than the analysis based on all five years.","567":"Influenza virus seasonality, synchronicity, and vaccine supply differ substantially between temperate and tropical settings, and optimal vaccination strategy may differ on this basis. Many national vaccine recommendations focus on high-risk groups, elderly populations, and healthcare workers despite previous analyses demonstrating broad benefits to vaccinating younger high-contact age groups. In this study, we parameterized an age-structured nonseasonal asynchronous epidemiological model of influenza virus transmission for a tropical low-income setting. We evaluated timing and age allocation of vaccines across vaccine supplies ranging from 10 to 90% using decade-based age groups. Year-round vaccination was beneficial when compared with more concentrated annual vaccine distribution. When targeting a single age group for vaccine prioritization, maximum vaccine allocation to the 10-19 high-contact age group minimized annual influenza mortality for all but one vaccine supply. When evaluating across all possible age allocations, optimal strategies always allocated a plurality of vaccines to school-age children (10-19). The converse, however, was not true as not all strategies allocating a plurality to children aged 10-19 minimized mortality. Allocating a high proportion of vaccine supply to the 10-19 age group is necessary but not sufficient to minimize annual mortality as distribution of remaining vaccine doses to other age groups also needs to be optimized. Strategies focusing on indirect benefits (vaccinating children) showed higher variance in mortality outcomes than strategies focusing on direct benefits (vaccinating the elderly). However, the indirect benefit approaches showed a lower mean mortality and a lower minimum mortality than vaccination focused on the elderly.","568":"We utilized retrospective electronic medical records of patients who underwent a screening or diagnostic test for lung cancer at an academic medical center in Chicago to examine the associations between lung cancer diagnosis and individual characteristics (age, gender, race\/ethnicity, and smoking status) and neighborhood-level homicide rate. We then used a synthetic population to estimate the neighborhood-level lung cancer risk to understand spatial clusters of increased homicide rates and lung cancer risk.Neighborhood violence was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. Black residents in Chicago are disproportionately exposed to neighborhood violence, which may partially explain the existing racial disparity in lung cancer. Incorporating neighborhood violence exposure into lung cancer risk models may help identify high-risk individuals who could benefit from lung cancer screening.Older age and former\/current smoking status were associated with increased odds of lung cancer diagnosis. Hispanic patients were more likely than White patients to be diagnosed with lung cancer, but there was no statistical difference between Black and White patients in lung cancer diagnosis. The odds of being diagnosed with lung cancer were significantly higher for patients living in areas with the third and fourth quartiles of homicide rates compared to the second quartile of homicide rates. Furthermore, significant spatial clusters of increased lung cancer risk and homicide rates were observed on Chicago's South and West sides.Despite the lower prevalence and frequency of smoking, Black adults are disproportionately affected by lung cancer. Exposure to chronic stress generates heightened immune responses, which creates a cell environment conducive to lung cancer development. Residents in poor and segregated neighborhoods are exposed to increased neighborhood violence, and chronic exposure to violence may have downstream physiological stress responses, which may explain racial disparities in lung cancer in predominantly Black urban communities.","569":"In China, more firms in the textile and apparel industry adopt environmental management systems compared to firms that manufacture other products. It is important to know how the firms\u0092 financial and real performances are affected. We study the changes of firms\u0092 performance in profitability, sales, and operational efficiency after environmental management system (EMS) adoption using an event study. Based on 22 events of EMS adoption, we found a significant decrease in firms\u0092 profitability, sales, and inventory productivity. We explore the reasons which led to the decrease in firm performances. We found that the increase in sample firms\u0092 total assets is the major reason. The loss in operational efficiency and flexibility are due to the requirements of the EMS","570":"The importance of host transmissibility in disease emergence has been demonstrated in historical and recent pandemics that involve infectious individuals, known as superspreaders, who are capable of transmitting the infection to a large number of susceptible individuals. To investigate the impact of superspreaders on epidemic dynamics, we formulate deterministic and stochastic models that incorporate differences in superspreaders versus nonsuperspreaders. In particular, continuous-time Markov chain models are used to investigate epidemic features associated with the presence of superspreaders in a population. We parameterize the models for two case studies, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Ebola. Through mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, we find that the probability of outbreaks increases and time to outbreaks decreases as the prevalence of superspreaders increases in the population. In particular, as disease outbreaks occur more rapidly and more frequently when initiated by superspreaders, our results emphasize the need for expeditious public health interventions.","571":"We find that in moderate prevalence settings, once the morbidity control and EPHP goals are reached, it may be possible to maintain the goals using less frequent MDAs than those that are required to achieve the goals. On the other hand, in some high transmission settings, if control efforts are reduced after achieving the goals, particularly the morbidity control goal, there is a high chance of recrudescence.The World Health Organization (WHO) previously set goals of controlling morbidity due to schistosomiasis by 2020 and attaining elimination as a public health problem (EPHP) by 2025 (now adjusted to 2030 in the new neglected tropical diseases roadmap). As these milestones are reached, it is important that programs reassess their treatment strategies to either maintain these goals or progress from morbidity control to EPHP and ultimately to interruption of transmission. In this study, we consider different mass drug administration (MDA) strategies to maintain the goals.To reduce the risk of recrudescence after the goals are achieved, programs have to re-evaluate their strategies and decide to either maintain these goals with reduced efforts where feasible or continue with at least the same efforts required to reach the goals.We use two independently developed individual-based stochastic models of schistosomiasis transmission to assess the optimal treatment strategy of a multi-year program to maintain the morbidity control and the EPHP goals.","572":"Although previous evidence suggests that the infection fatality rate from COVID-19 varies by age and sex, and that transmission intensity varies geographically within countries, no study has yet explored the age-sex-space distribution of excess mortality associated with the COVID pandemic. By applying the principles of small-area estimation to existing model formulations for excess mortality, this study develops a novel method for assessing excess mortality across small populations and assesses the pattern of COVID excess mortality by province, year, week, age group, and sex in Italy from March through May 2020. We estimate that 53,200 excess deaths occurred across Italy during this time period, compared to just 35,500 deaths where COVID-19 was registered as the underlying cause of death. Out of the total excess mortality burden, 97% of excess deaths occurred among adults over age 60, and 68% of excess deaths were concentrated among adults over age 80. The burden of excess mortality was unevenly distributed across the country, with just three of Italy's 107 provinces accounting for 32% of all excess mortality. This method for estimating excess mortality can be adapted to other countries where COVID-19 diagnostic capacity is still insufficient, and could be incorporated into public health rapid response systems.","573":"We included 247 (7.7%) eligible studies in the analysis. We found within-year influenza patterns to vary across mainland China in relation to latitude and geographic location. High-latitude provinces were characterised by having short and intense annual winter epidemics, whilst most mid-latitude and low-latitude provinces experience semi-annual epidemics or year-round activity. Subtype activity varied across the country, with A\/H1N1pdm09 and influenza B occurring predominantly in the winter, whereas A\/H3N2 activity exhibited a latitudinal divide with high-latitude regions experiencing a winter peak, whilst mid and low-latitude regions experienced a summer epidemic. Epidemic onsets and peaks also varied, occurring first in the north and later in the southeast. We found positive associations between all influenza health outcomes. In addition, seasonal patterns at the prefecture and county-level broadly resembled their wider province.We conducted a systematic review and spatio-temporal meta-analysis to assess regional-based within-year variations of ILI outpatient consultation rates, influenza test positivity rates amongst both ILI outpatients and SARI inpatients, and influenza-associated excess mortality rates. We searched English and Chinese databases for articles reporting time-series data on the four influenza-related outcomes at the sub-national and sub-annual level. After synthesising the data, we reported on the mean monthly rate, epidemic onset, duration, peak and intensity.China experiences large variations in influenza seasonal activity. We aim to update and improve the current understanding of regional-based within-year variations of influenza activity across mainland China to provide evidence for the planning and optimisation of healthcare strategies.This is the first systematic review to simultaneously examine the seasonal variation of multiple influenza-related health outcomes at multiple spatial scales across mainland China. The seasonality information provided here has important implications for the planning and optimisation of immunisation programmes and healthcare provision, supporting the need for regional-based approaches to address variations in local epidemiology.","574":"), by tracking movements and behaviour of sympatric individuals over extended periods and across relatively large spatial scales, thereby precluding alternative explanations such as local enhancement. In agreement with the ICH, we found that 'informed' individuals returning to previously visited carcasses were followed by 'uninformed' vultures that consequently got access to these resources. When a dyad (two individuals that depart from the same roost within 2 min of each other) included an informed individual, they spent a higher proportion of the flight time close to each other at a shorter distance between them than otherwise. Although all individuals occasionally profited from following others, they differed in their tendencies to be informed or uninformed. This study provides evidence for 'following behaviour' in natural conditions and demonstrates differential roles and information states among foragers within a population. Moreover, demonstrating the possible reliance of vultures on following behaviour emphasizes that individuals in declining populations may suffer from reduced foraging efficiency.","575":" In response to this escalating public health concern, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases held the workshop \"Overcoming Waning Immunity in Pertussis Vaccines\" in September 2019 to identify issues and possible solutions for the defects in immunity stimulated by acellular pertussis vaccines. Discussions covered aspects of the current problem, gaps in knowledge and possible paths forward. This review summarizes presentations and discussions of some of the key points that were raised by the workshop.","576":"Social media posts regarding measles vaccination were classified as pro-vaccination, expressing vaccine hesitancy, uncertain, or irrelevant. Spearman correlations with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-reported measles cases and differenced smoothed cumulative case counts over this period were reported (using time series bootstrap confidence intervals). A total of 58,078 Facebook posts and 82,993 tweets were identified from 4 January 2009 to 27 August 2016. Pro-vaccination posts were correlated with the US weekly reported cases (Facebook: Spearman correlation 0.22 (95% confidence interval: 0.09 to 0.34), Twitter: 0.21 (95% confidence interval: 0.06 to 0.34)). Vaccine-hesitant posts, however, were uncorrelated with measles cases in the United States (Facebook: 0.01 (95% confidence interval: -0.13 to 0.14), Twitter: 0.0011 (95% confidence interval: -0.12 to 0.12)). These findings may result from more consistent social media engagement by individuals expressing vaccine hesitancy, contrasted with media- or event-driven episodic interest on the part of individuals favoring current policy.","577":"Functional MRI (fMRI) data may be contaminated by artifacts arising from a myriad of sources, including subject head motion, respiration, heartbeat, scanner drift, and thermal noise. These artifacts cause deviations from common distributional assumptions, introduce spatial and temporal outliers, and reduce the signal-to-noise ratio of the data-all of which can have negative consequences for the accuracy and power of downstream statistical analysis. Scrubbing is a technique for excluding fMRI volumes thought to be contaminated by artifacts and generally comes in two flavors. Motion scrubbing based on subject head motion-derived measures is popular but suffers from a number of drawbacks, among them the need to choose a threshold, a lack of generalizability to multiband acquisitions, and high rates of censoring of individual volumes and entire subjects. Alternatively, data-driven scrubbing methods like DVARS are based on observed noise in the processed fMRI timeseries and may avoid some of these issues. Here we propose \"projection scrubbing\", a novel data-driven scrubbing method based on a statistical outlier detection framework and strategic dimension reduction, including independent component analysis (ICA), to isolate artifactual variation. We undertake a comprehensive comparison of motion scrubbing with data-driven projection scrubbing and DVARS. We argue that an appropriate metric for the success of scrubbing is maximal data retention subject to reasonable performance on typical benchmarks such as the validity, reliability, and identifiability of functional connectivity. We find that stringent motion scrubbing yields worsened validity, worsened reliability, and produced small improvements to fingerprinting. Meanwhile, data-driven scrubbing methods tend to yield greater improvements to fingerprinting while not generally worsening validity or reliability. Importantly, however, data-driven scrubbing excludes a fraction of the number of volumes or entire sessions compared to motion scrubbing. The ability of data-driven fMRI scrubbing to improve data retention without negatively impacting the quality of downstream analysis has major implications for sample sizes in population neuroscience research.","578":"Glaucoma disease progression, as measured by visual field (VF) data, is often defined by periods of relative stability followed by an abrupt decrease in visual ability at some point in time. Determining the transition point of the disease trajectory to a more severe state is important clinically for disease management and for avoiding irreversible vision loss. Based on this, we present a unified statistical modeling framework that permits prediction of the timing and spatial location of future vision loss and informs clinical decisions regarding disease progression. The developed method incorporates anatomical information to create a biologically plausible data-generating model. We accomplish this by introducing a spatially varying coefficients model that includes spatially varying change points to detect structural shifts in both the mean and variance process of VF data across both space and time. The VF location-specific change point represents the underlying, and potentially censored, timing of true change in disease trajectory while a multivariate spatial boundary detection structure is introduced that accounts for the complex spatial connectivity of the VF and optic disc. We show that our method improves estimation and prediction of multiple aspects of disease management in comparison to existing methods through simulation and real data application. The R package spCP implements the new methodology.","579":"There is increasing attention on the need to identify new immune markers for the evaluation of existing and new influenza vaccines. Immune markers that could predict individual protection against infection and disease, commonly called \"correlates of protection\" (CoPs), play an important role in vaccine development and licensing. Here, we discuss the epidemiological considerations when evaluating immune markers as potential CoPs for influenza vaccines and emphasize the distinction between correlation and causation. While an immune marker that correlates well with protection from infection may be used as a predictor of vaccine efficacy, it should be distinguished from an immune marker that plays a mechanistic role in conferring protection against a clinical endpoint, as the latter may be a more reliable predictor of vaccine efficacy and a more appropriate target for rational vaccine design. To clearly distinguish mechanistic and non-mechanistic CoPs, we suggest using the term \"correlates of protection\" for non-mechanistic CoPs, and \"mediators of protection\" for mechanistic CoPs. Furthermore, as the interactions among and relative importance of correlates or mediators of protection may vary according to age or prior vaccine experience, the effect sizes and thresholds for protective effects for CoPs may also vary in different segments of the population.","580":" ) and other key signatures of outbreak intensity are modulated by transmission between infected individuals and the environment. In addition, country-level outbreaks vary in the degree to which environmental transmission appears to modulate COVID-19 dynamics. Summarizing, we propose that informed models of sit and wait, environmental transmission are essential in emerging outbreaks, as they highlight how variation in environmental transmission may explain observed differences in disease dynamics from setting to setting, and can inform public health interventions.","581":"A stratified SEIR model was developed that captures the role of social contacts in K-12 schools to estimate COVID-19 transmission under different nonpharmaceutical interventions.While masks, random screening, contact reduction, school closures, and test-to-stay are all beneficial interventions, masks and contact reduction resulted in the greatest reduction in new infections among students from the tested scenarios.Layered interventions provide more benefits than implementing interventions independently.Background. The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 spread across the world causing many waves of COVID-19. Children were at high risk of being exposed to the disease because they were not eligible for vaccination during the first 20 mo of the pandemic in the United States. While children 5 y and older are now eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States, vaccination rates remain low despite most schools returning to in-person instruction. Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are important for controlling the spread of COVID-19 in K-12 schools. US school districts used varied and layered mitigation strategies during the pandemic. The goal of this article is to analyze the impact of different NPIs on COVID-19 transmission within K-12 schools. Methods. We developed a deterministic stratified SEIR model that captures the role of social contacts between cohorts in disease transmission to estimate COVID-19 incidence under different NPIs including masks, random screening, contact reduction, school closures, and test-to-stay. We designed contact matrices to simulate the contact patterns between students and teachers within schools. We estimated the proportion of susceptible infected associated with each intervention over 1 semester under the Omicron variant. Results. We find that masks and reducing contacts can greatly reduce new infections among students. Weekly screening tests also have a positive impact on disease mitigation. While self-quarantining symptomatic infections and school closures are effective measures for decreasing semester-end infections, they increase absenteeism. Conclusion. The model provides a useful tool for evaluating the impact of a variety of NPIs on disease transmission in K-12 schools. While the model is tested under Omicron variant parameters in US K-12 schools, it can be adapted to study other populations under different disease settings.","582":"Satellite remote sensing provides a wealth of information about environmental factors that influence malaria transmission cycles and human populations at risk. Long-term observations facilitate analysis of climate-malaria relationships, and high-resolution data can be used to assess the effects of agriculture, urbanization, deforestation, and water management on malaria. New sources of very-high-resolution satellite imagery and synthetic aperture radar data will increase the precision and frequency of observations. Cloud computing platforms for remote sensing data combined with analysis-ready datasets and high-level data products have made satellite remote sensing more accessible to nonspecialists. Further collaboration between the malaria and remote sensing communities is needed to develop and implement useful geospatial data products that will support global efforts toward malaria control, elimination, and eradication.","583":"We created a synthetic dataset with daily counts of influenza cases and vaccinations, calculated \"true\" averted cases using a reference model applied to the daily data, aggregated the data by month to simulate data that would actually be available, and evaluated the month-level data with seven test methods (including the current method). Methods with averted case estimates closest to the reference model were considered most accurate. To examine their performance under varying conditions, we re-evaluated the test methods when synthetic data parameters (timing of vaccination relative to cases, vaccination coverage, infection rate, and vaccine effectiveness) were varied over wide ranges. Finally, we analyzed real (i.e., collected by surveillance) data from 2010 to 2017 comparing the current method used by CDC with the best-performing test methods.In the synthetic dataset (population 1 million persons, vaccination uptake 55%, seasonal infection risk without vaccination 12%, vaccine effectiveness 48%) the reference model estimated 28,768 averted cases. The current method underestimated averted cases by 9%. The two best test methods estimated averted cases with <1% error. These two methods also worked well when synthetic data parameters were varied over wide ranges (\u22646.2% error). With the real data, these two methods estimated numbers of averted cases that are a median 8% higher than the currently-used method.We identified two methods for estimating numbers of influenza cases averted by vaccine that are more accurate than the currently-used algorithm. These methods will help us to better assess the benefits of influenza vaccination.To evaluate the public health benefit of yearly influenza vaccinations, CDC estimates the number of influenza cases and hospitalizations averted by vaccine. Available input data on cases and vaccinations is aggregated by month and the estimation model is intentionally simple, raising concerns about the accuracy of estimates.","584":"Both outbreaks started in small towns, but cases were also detected in nearby larger cities where transmission was limited to small clusters. The time spans between the first and the last symptom onsets were similar between the 2 outbreaks, and the delay from the symptom onset of the index case and the first case notified was considerable. Comparable infection and transmission rates were observed in laboratory. The basic reproductive number (R0) was estimated in the range of 1.8-6 (2007) and 1.5-2.6 (2017). Clinical characteristics were similar between outbreaks, and no acute complications were reported, though a higher frequency of ocular symptoms, myalgia, and rash was observed in 2017. Very little is known about the immune mediator profile of CHIKV-infected patients during the 2 outbreaks. Regarding public health responses, after the 2007 outbreak, the Italian Ministry of Health developed national guidelines to implement surveillance and good practices to prevent and control autochthonous transmission. However, only a few regional authorities implemented it, and the perception of outbreak risk and knowledge of clinical symptoms and transmission dynamics by general practitioners remained low.Efforts should be devoted to developing suitable procedures for early detection of virus circulation in the population, possibly through the analysis of medical records in near real time. Increasing the awareness of CHIKV of general practitioners and public health officials through tailored education may be effective, especially in small coastal towns where the outbreak risk may be higher. A key element is also the shift of citizen awareness from considering Aedes mosquitoes not only as a nuisance problem but also as a public health one. We advocate the need of strengthening the surveillance and of promoting the active participation of the communities to prevent and contain future outbreaks.","585":"Based on 2 case definitions, we estimate between 0.42-3.2% and 0.33-1.2% of symptomatic influenza illnesses were laboratory-confirmed in Canada during the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 seasons, respectively. In the US, we estimate between 0.08-0.61% and 0.07-0.33% of symptomatic influenza illnesses were laboratory-confirmed in the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 seasons, respectively. We estimated the symptomatic influenza illnesses in Canada to be 0.32-2.4 million in 2011-2012 and 1.8-8.2 million in 2012-2013. In the US, we estimate the number of symptomatic influenza illnesses to be 4.4-34 million in 2011-2012 and 23-102 million in 2012-2013.We use a dynamic disease transmission model, laboratory-confirmed influenza surveillance data, and randomized-controlled trial (RCT) data to quantify the underestimation factor, expansion factor, and symptomatic influenza illnesses in the US and Canada during the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 influenza seasons.Seasonal influenza poses a significant public health and economic burden, associated with the outcome of infection and resulting complications. The true burden of the disease is difficult to capture due to the wide range of presentation, from asymptomatic cases to non-respiratory complications such as cardiovascular events, and its seasonal variability. An understanding of the magnitude of the true annual incidence of influenza is important to support prevention and control policy development and to evaluate the impact of preventative measures such as vaccination.We illustrate that monitoring a representative group within a population may aid in effectively modelling the transmission of infectious diseases such as influenza. In particular, the utilization of RCTs in models may enhance the accuracy of epidemiological parameter estimation.","586":"When species disperse into previously unoccupied habitats, new populations encounter unfamiliar species interactions such as altered parasite loads. Theory predicts that newly founded populations should exhibit destabilized eco-evolutionary fluctuations in infection rates and immune traits. However, to understand founder effects biologists typically rely on retrospective studies of range expansions, missing early-generation infection dynamics. To remedy this, we experimentally founded whole-lake populations of threespine stickleback. Infection rates were temporally stable in native source lakes. In contrast, newly founded populations exhibit destabilized host-parasite dynamics: high starting infection rates led to increases in a heritable immune trait (peritoneal fibrosis), suppressing infection rates. The resulting temporal auto-correlation between infection and immunity suggest that newly founded populations can exhibit rapid host-parasite eco-evolutionary dynamics.","587":"In total, 2 antihypertensive drug classifications were constructed, one based on RxCUIs and one based on medication name, that can be used in future computable phenotypes that require antihypertensive drug classifications.Computable phenotypes have the ability to utilize data within the electronic health record (EHR) to identify patients with certain characteristics. Many computable phenotypes rely on multiple types of data within the EHR including prescription drug information. Hypertension (HTN)-related computable phenotypes are particularly dependent on the correct classification of antihypertensive prescription drug information, as well as corresponding diagnoses and blood pressure information.This study aimed to create an antihypertensive drug classification system to be utilized with EHR-based data as part of HTN-related computable phenotypes.We compared 4 different antihypertensive drug classification systems based off of 4 different methodologies and terminologies, including 3 RxNorm Concept Unique Identifier (RxCUI)-based classifications and 1 medication name-based classification. The RxCUI-based classifications utilized data from (1) the Drug Ontology, (2) the new Medication Reference Terminology, and (3) the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System and DrugBank, whereas the medication name-based classification relied on antihypertensive drug names. Each classification system was applied to EHR-based prescription drug data from hypertensive patients in the OneFlorida Data Trust.There were 13,627 unique RxCUIs and 8025 unique medication names from the 13,879,046 prescriptions. We observed a broad overlap between the 4 methods, with 84.1% (691\/822) to 95.3% (695\/729) of terms overlapping pairwise between the different classification methods. Key differences arose from drug products with multiple dosage forms, drug products with an indication of benign prostatic hyperplasia, drug products that contain more than 1 ingredient (combination products), and terms within the classification systems corresponding to retired or obsolete RxCUIs.","588":"To detect spatial and temporal changes in community drug use by analyzing concentrations of analytes in influent wastewater and exploring their associations with area-based socioeconomic and sociodemographic metrics like the area deprivation index (ADI) and rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) codes.Measuring drug use behaviors in individuals and across large communities presents substantial challenges, often complicated by socioeconomic and demographic variables.This longitudinal, cross-sectional wastewater study was performed from May 2022 to April 2023 and included biweekly influent wastewater samples of 39 analytes from 8 sampling locations across 6 wastewater treatment plants in southern Nevada. Statistical analyses were conducted in December 2023.Over the 12-month wastewater monitoring period, 208 samples for PPCPs and HRSs were collected, and analysis revealed an increase in the consumption of HRSs and the seasonal variation in PPCP use in southern Nevada. There was a significant increase in levels of stimulant-associated analytes, such as cocaine (\u03b2\u2009=\u20099.17\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4; SE\u2009=\u20091.29\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4; PFDR\u2009=\u20091.40\u2009\u00d7\u200910-10), and opioids or their metabolites, notably norfentanyl (\u03b2\u2009=\u20091.48\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4; SE\u2009=\u20091.88\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4; PFDR\u2009=\u20091.66\u2009\u00d7\u200910-12). In contrast, DEET, an active ingredient in mosquito and tick repellents, demonstrated a seasonal use pattern (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-4.85\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4; SE\u2009=\u20092.09\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4; PFDR\u2009=\u20094.87\u2009\u00d7\u200910-2). Wastewater from more disadvantaged or rural neighborhoods, as assessed through ADI and RUCA scores, was more likely to show a significant positive correlation with HRSs, such as cocaine (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.075; SE\u2009=\u20090.038; P\u2009=\u2009.05) and norfentanyl (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.004; SE\u2009=\u20090.001; P\u2009=\u20091.64\u2009\u00d7\u200910-5).It was hypothesized that wastewater monitoring of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and high-risk substances (HRSs) could reveal true spatial and temporal drug use patterns in near-real time. Data collection of samples for PPCPs and HRSs was performed using mass spectrometry. Both ADI and RUCA scores were utilized to characterize neighborhood contexts in the analysis. The false discovery rate (FDR) method was utilized to correct for multiple comparisons (PFDR).These findings suggest that wastewater monitoring of PPCPs and HRSs offers a complementary method to existing public health tools, providing timely data for tracking substance use behaviors and use of PPCPs at a population level.","589":"This protocol describes a strategy for investigating the association between elevated allostatic load indices in childhood at the age of 9 years old and psychiatric disorders in adulthood at 24 years old.The cumulative burden of chronic stress and life events has been termed allostatic load. Elevated allostatic load indices are associated with different mental health conditions in adulthood. To date, however, the association between elevated allostatic load in childhood and later development of mental health conditions has not been investigated.Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), we will calculate allostatic load indices using biomarkers representing the cardiovascular, metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine systems, at the ages of 9 and 17 years. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models will be used to investigate the association between allostatic load and psychiatric disorders in adulthood. Furthermore, the role of adverse childhood experiences as a modifier will be investigated.","590":"Here we introduce LINflow, a computational pipeline that infers pairwise genomic similarity in a set of genomes. LINflow takes advantage of the speed of the alignment-free sourmash tool to identify the genome in a dataset that is most similar to a query genome and the precision of the alignment-based pyani software to precisely compute ANI between the query genome and the most similar genome identified by sourmash. This is repeated for each new genome that is added to a dataset. The sequentially computed ANI values are stored as Life Identification Numbers (LINs), which are then used to infer all other pairwise ANI values in the set. We tested LINflow on four sets, 484 genomes in total, and compared the needed time and the generated similarity matrices with other tools.Computing genomic similarity between strains is a prerequisite for genome-based prokaryotic classification and identification. Genomic similarity was first computed as Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) values based on the alignment of genomic fragments. Since this is computationally expensive, faster and computationally cheaper alignment-free methods have been developed to estimate ANI. However, these methods do not reach the level of accuracy of alignment-based methods.LINflow is up to 150 times faster than pyani and pairwise ANI values generated by LINflow are highly correlated with those computed by pyani. However, because LINflow infers most pairwise ANI values instead of computing them directly, ANI values occasionally depart from the ANI values computed by pyani. In conclusion, LINflow is a fast and memory-efficient pipeline to infer similarity among a large set of prokaryotic genomes. Its ability to quickly add new genome sequences to an already computed similarity matrix makes LINflow particularly useful for projects when new genome sequences need to be regularly added to an existing dataset.","591":"We defined the stepped wedge trial design and reviewed the indications for the design in depth. In addition, key considerations, including mainstream methods of analysis and sample size determination, were discussed.Stepped wedge designs can be attractive for study intervention programs aiming to improve the delivery of patient care, especially when examining a small number of heterogeneous clusters.Stepped wedge cluster randomized trials enable rigorous evaluations of health intervention programs in pragmatic settings. In the present study, we aimed to update neurosurgeon scientists on the design of stepped wedge randomized trials.We have presented an overview of recent methodological developments for stepped wedge designs and included an update on the newer associated methodological tools to aid with future study designs.","592":"More than 37,000,000 US adults smoke cigarettes. Most are interested in quitting, but rates of successful cessation remain low. Developing more and better approaches to tobacco treatment is a public health priority. The evolution of vehicular travel may present an opportunity for tobacco treatment intervention. We recruited individuals who reported previous use of ridesharing services (eg, Uber or Lyft) at 10 sites in the Boston area. They completed an anonymous survey that collected sociodemographic and tobacco use information and assessed participants' interest in receiving various forms of tobacco treatment during their rideshare rides. Forty-nine adult smokers completed the survey. Mean age\u00a0= 40.1, 61.2% male, 51.0% white, 16.3% African American\/black, 14.3% Latino, and 8.2% Asian. Almost 70% were college graduates, 79.6% worked full time, and 40.8% used ridesharing services \u2265 weekly. They smoked a mean of 8.7 cigarettes per day; 35.3% were moderately or highly nicotine dependent, 36.7% also smoked cigars, 34.7% also used e-cigarettes, and 41.7% were in the contemplation or preparation stage of quitting. More than 56% of participants expressed some level of interest in receiving quit-smoking messaging during their rideshare rides. On multivariate analysis, black or Latino race\/ethnicity and rideshare frequency of at least once a week were associated with interest in receiving quit-smoking messaging during rideshare rides. The majority of rideshare users who smoke are amenable to the idea of quit-smoking messaging delivered to them during their rides, and interest rates were highest among black or Latino riders and those who used rideshare services most frequently.","593":"Opioid overdose deaths in the United States quadrupled from 1999 (n = 8050 deaths) to 2015 (n = 33\u2009091 deaths), and the number of deaths associated with synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, increased from 3105 deaths in 2013 to nearly 20\u2009000 deaths in 2016. Given this rapid increase, timely surveillance for drugs in circulation is crucial. However, current surveillance systems used to track drug overdoses do not detect new drugs in circulation quickly. We studied the change in the presence of fentanyl in \"stamp bag\" drug evidence in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, from 2010 through 2016. Stamp bags are small wax packets with individual stamps that contain mixtures of drugs, most commonly heroin, that law enforcement officers seize and retain as legal evidence. The proportion of stamp bags determined to contain fentanyl or a fentanyl analog was 2.1% in 2014 and rose sharply to 17.1% in 2016. Monitoring the chemical makeup of drug evidence items could help public health authorities identify drug use trends in their jurisdictions.","594":"Men have higher rates of morbidity and mortality across nearly all top ten causes of mortality worldwide. Much of this disparity is attributed to men's lower utilization of routine health services; however, little is known about men's general healthcare utilization in sub-Saharan Africa.We analyze the responses of 1,116 men in a community-representative survey of men drawn from a multi-staged sample of residents of 36 villages in Malawi to identify factors associated with men's facility attendance in the last 12 months, either for men's own health (client visit) or to support the health care of someone else (caregiver visit). We conducted single-variable tests of association and multivariable logistic regression with random effects to account for clustering at the village level.Quality of services offered at local health facilities and men's health status were the only variables associated with client facility visits among men, while harmful gender norms, not being married, and being younger were negatively associated with caregiver visits.Median age of participants was 34, 74% were married, and 82% attended a health facility in the last year (63% as client, 47% as caregiver). Neither gender norm beliefs nor socioeconomic factors were independently associated with attending a client visit. Only problems with quality of health services (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.294, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.10-0.823) and good health (aOR 0.668, 95% CI 0.462-0.967) were independently associated with client visit attendance. Stronger beliefs in gender norms were associated with caregiver visits (beliefs about acceptability of violence [aOR\u2009=\u20090.661, 95% CI 0.488-0.896], male sexual dominance [aOR\u2009=\u20090.703, 95% CI 0.505-0.978], and traditional women's roles [aOR\u2009=\u20090.718, 95% CI 0.533-0.966]). Older age (aOR 0.542, 95% CI 0.401-0.731) and being married (aOR 2.380, 95% CI 1.196-4.737) were also independently associated with caregiver visits.","595":"Applying the current timing of vaccinations averted 223,761 influenza cases, $16.3 million in direct health care costs, $50.0 million in productivity losses, and 804 in QALYs, compared with no vaccination (February peak, R0 1.2). When the population does not have preexisting immunity and the influenza season peaks in February (R0 1.2-1.6), moving individuals who currently received the vaccine after September to the end of September could avert an additional 9634-17,794 influenza cases, $0.6-$1.4 million in direct costs, $2.1-$4.0 million in productivity losses, and 35-64 QALYs. Moving the vaccination of just children to September (R0 1.2-1.6) averted 11,366-1660 influenza cases, $0.6-$0.03 million in direct costs, $2.3-$0.2 million in productivity losses, and 42-8 QALYs. Moving the season peak to December increased these benefits, whereas increasing preexisting immunity reduced these benefits.Even though many people are vaccinated well after September\/October, they likely are still vaccinated early enough to provide substantial cost-savings.We used real data on when individuals were vaccinated in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, and the following 2 models to determine the value of vaccinating individuals earlier (by the end of September, October, and November): Framework for Reconstructing Epidemiological Dynamics (FRED), an agent-based model (ABM), and FluEcon, our influenza economic model that translates cases from the ABM to outcomes and costs [health care and lost productivity costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)]. We varied the reproductive number (R0) from 1.2 to 1.6.Influenza vaccination is administered throughout the influenza disease season, even as late as March. Given such timing, what is the value of vaccinating the population earlier than currently being practiced?","596":"SARS-CoV-2 has caused a severe, ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Massachusetts with 111,070 confirmed cases and 8,433 deaths as of August 1, 2020. To investigate the introduction, spread, and epidemiology of COVID-19 in the Boston area, we sequenced and analyzed 772 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the region, including nearly all confirmed cases within the first week of the epidemic and hundreds of cases from major outbreaks at a conference, a nursing facility, and among homeless shelter guests and staff. The data reveal over 80 introductions into the Boston area, predominantly from elsewhere in the United States and Europe. We studied two superspreading events covered by the data, events that led to very different outcomes because of the timing and populations involved. One produced rapid spread in a vulnerable population but little onward transmission, while the other was a major contributor to sustained community transmission, including outbreaks in homeless populations, and was exported to several other domestic and international sites. The same two events differed significantly in the number of new mutations seen, raising the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 superspreading might encompass disparate transmission dynamics. Our results highlight the failure of measures to prevent importation into MA early in the outbreak, underscore the role of superspreading in amplifying an outbreak in a major urban area, and lay a foundation for contact tracing informed by genetic data.","597":"Criminal justice involved (CJI) individuals with a history of opioid use disorder (OUD) are at high risk of overdose and death in the weeks following release from jail. We developed the Justice-Community Circulation Model (JCCM) to investigate OUD\/CJI dynamics post-release and the effects of interventions on overdose deaths. The JCCM uses a synthetic agent-based model population of approximately 150,000 unique individuals that is generated using demographic information collected from multiple Chicago-area studies and data sets. We use a high-performance computing (HPC) workflow to implement a sequential approximate Bayesian computation algorithm for calibrating the JCCM. The calibration results in the simulated joint posterior distribution of the JCCM input parameters. The calibrated model is used to investigate the effects of a naloxone intervention for a mass jail release. The simulation results show the degree to which a targeted intervention focusing on recently released jail inmates can help reduce the risk of death from opioid overdose.","598":"We analyzed three National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) datasets for 2013-2014, 2015-2016, and 2017-2018. The primary predictor variable was race, and the outcome variable was three domains of healthcare access: insurance status, having any routine place for healthcare, and having any health visits in the past year. Chi-square tests and unadjusted and adjusted multivariate logistic regressions were conducted. The models were adjusted for age, education, income, and CKD stages and were weighted to account for the sampling strategy.Hispanic CKD patients have limited healthcare access compared to White populations showing existing care access disparities experienced by them. Improved programs and policies are required to enhance kidney health among Hispanics and promote equity in CKD.Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health concern, and the disease disproportionately affects Hispanics. Improved healthcare access for Hispanic CKD patients can reduce the disease burden. This study assesses the healthcare access disparities experienced by Hispanic CKD patients compared to Whites.The sample size was 1864 CKD patients from three two-year cycles of NHANES datasets (2013-2014, 2015-2016, and 2017-2018). The final adjusted model found that Hispanic CKD patients were more likely to be uninsured (OR: 2.52, CI 1.66-3.83) and have no routine place for healthcare (OR: 1.68, CI 1.03-2.75) than White CKD patients, but did not have differences in healthcare visits in the past year.","599":"As the last habitable continent colonized by humans, the site of multiple domestication hotspots, and the location of the largest Pleistocene megafaunal extinction, South America is central to human prehistory. Yet remarkably little is known about human population dynamics during colonization, subsequent expansions, and domestication. Here we reconstruct the spatiotemporal patterns of human population growth in South America using a newly aggregated database of 1,147 archaeological sites and 5,464 calibrated radiocarbon dates spanning fourteen thousand to two thousand years ago (ka). We demonstrate that, rather than a steady exponential expansion, the demographic history of South Americans is characterized by two distinct phases. First, humans spread rapidly throughout the continent, but remained at low population sizes for 8,000 years, including a 4,000-year period of 'boom-and-bust' oscillations with no net growth. Supplementation of hunting with domesticated crops and animals had a minimal impact on population carrying capacity. Only with widespread sedentism, beginning ~5\u2009ka, did a second demographic phase begin, with evidence for exponential population growth in cultural hotspots, characteristic of the Neolithic transition worldwide. The unique extent of humanity's ability to modify its environment to markedly increase carrying capacity in South America is therefore an unexpectedly recent phenomenon. ","600":"We found no evidence that intrauterine contraception (Cu-IUD or LNG-IUS) altered the vaginal microbiota composition. Therefore, the use of intrauterine contraception is unlikely to shift the composition of the vaginal microbiota such that infection susceptibility is altered.There have been conflicting reports of altered vaginal microbiota and infection susceptibility associated with contraception use. The objectives of this study were to determine if intrauterine contraception altered the vaginal microbiota and to compare the effects of a copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) and a levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) on the vaginal microbiota.DNA was isolated from the vaginal swab samples of 76 women using Cu-IUD (n=36) or LNG-IUS (n=40) collected prior to insertion of intrauterine contraception (baseline) and at 6 months. A third swab from approximately 12 months following insertion was available for 69 (Cu-IUD, n=33; LNG-IUS, n=36) of these women. The V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA-encoding gene was amplified from the vaginal swab DNA and sequenced. The 16S rRNA gene sequences were processed and analyzed using the software package mothur to compare the structure and dynamics of the vaginal bacterial communities.Although the vaginal microbiota can be highly dynamic, alterations in the community associated with the use of intrauterine contraception (Cu-IUD or LNG-IUS) were not detected over 12 months.The vaginal microbiota from individuals in this study clustered into 3 major vaginal bacterial community types: one dominated by Lactobacillus iners, one dominated by Lactobacillus crispatus and one community type that was not dominated by a single Lactobacillus species. Changes in the vaginal bacterial community composition were not associated with the use of Cu-IUD or LNG-IUS. Additionally, we did not observe a clear difference in vaginal microbiota stability with Cu-IUD versus LNG-IUS use.","601":"When agencies release public-use data, they must be cognizant of the potential risk of disclosure associated with making their data publicly available. This issue is particularly pertinent in disease mapping, where small counts pose both inferential challenges and potential disclosure risks. While the small area estimation, disease mapping, and statistical disclosure limitation literatures are individually robust, there have been few intersections between them. Here, we formally propose the use of spatiotemporal data analysis methods to generate synthetic data for public use. Specifically, we analyze ten years of county-level heart disease death counts for multiple age-groups using a Bayesian model that accounts for dependence spatially, temporally, and between age-groups; generating synthetic data from the resulting posterior predictive distribution will preserve these dependencies. After demonstrating the synthetic data's privacy-preserving features, we illustrate their utility by comparing estimates of urban\/rural disparities from the synthetic data to those from data with small counts suppressed.","602":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a devastating critical care syndrome with significant morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the predictive values of dynamic clinical indices by developing machine-learning (ML) models for early and accurate clinical assessment of the disease prognosis of ARDS. We conducted a retrospective observational study by applying dynamic clinical data collected in the ARDSNet FACTT Trial (n\u2009=\u20091000) to ML-based algorithms for predicting mortality. In order to compare the significance of clinical features dynamically, we further applied the random forest (RF) model to nine selected clinical parameters acquired at baseline and day 3 independently. An RF model trained using clinical data collected at day 3 showed improved performance and prognostication efficacy (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.78-0.89) compared to baseline with an AUC value of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.65-0.78). Mean airway pressure (MAP), bicarbonate, age, platelet count, albumin, heart rate, and glucose were the most significant clinical indicators associated with mortality at day 3. Thus, clinical features collected early (day 3) improved performance of integrative ML models with better prognostication for mortality. Among these, MAP represented the most important feature for ARDS patients' early risk stratification.","603":"Sixteen primary care physicians.We identified three key themes. First, prescribers viewed low-value prescribing among older adults as common, characterized both by features of the medications themselves and of the particular patients to whom they were prescribed. Second, prescribers described the causes of low-value prescribing as multifactorial, with factors related to patients, prescribers, and the health system as a whole, making low-value prescribing a default practice pattern. Third, interventions addressing low-value prescribing must minimize the cognitive load and time pressures that make low-value prescribing common. Interventions increasing time pressure or cognitive load, such as increased documentation, were considered less acceptable.Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews.Our findings demonstrate that low-value prescribing is a well-recognized phenomenon, and that interventions to reduce low-value prescribing must consider physicians' perspectives and address the specific patient, prescriber and health system factors that make low-value prescribing a default practice.Health systems are increasingly implementing interventions to reduce older patients' use of low-value medications. However, prescribers' perspectives on medication value and the acceptability of interventions to reduce low-value prescribing are poorly understood.Academic and community primary care practices within University of Pittsburgh Medical Center health system.We elicited 16 prescribers' perspectives on definitions and examples of low-value prescribing in older adults, the factors that incentivize them to engage in such prescribing, and the characteristics of interventions that would make them less likely to engage in low-value prescribing.To identify the characteristics that affect the value of a medication and those factors influencing low-value prescribing from the perspective of primary care physicians.","604":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus disproportionately causes serious illness and death in older individuals. In order to have the greatest impact in decreasing the human toll caused by the virus, antiviral treatment should be targeted to older patients. For this, we need a better understanding of the differences in viral dynamics between SARS-CoV-2 infection in younger and older adults. In this study, we use previously published averaged viral titre measurements from the nose and throat of SARS-CoV-2 infection in young and aged cynomolgus macaques to parametrize a viral kinetics model. We find that all viral kinetics parameters differ between young and aged macaques in the nasal passages, but that there are fewer differences in parameter estimates from the throat. We further use our parametrized model to study the antiviral treatment of young and aged animals, finding that early antiviral treatment is more likely to lead to a lengthening of the infection in aged animals, but not in young animals.","605":"The aim of this study was to determine the impact of preoperative pulmonary risk factors (PRFS) on surgical outcomes after posterior spinal fusion (PSF) for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).A total of 4929 patients were identified, of whom 280 (5.7%) had baseline PRF. Compared with the no-PRF cohort, the PRF cohort had higher rates of complications (PRF, 4.3% vs. no-PRF, 2.2%; P\u00a0= 0.03) and longer hospital stays (PRF, 4.6 \u00b1 4.3 days vs. no-PRF, 3.8 \u00b1 2.3 days; P < 0.001), yet, discharge disposition was similar between cohorts (P\u00a0= 0.70). Rates of 30-day unplanned readmission were significantly higher in the PRF cohort (PRF, 6.3% vs. no-PRF, 2.7%; P\u00a0= 0.009), yet, days to readmission (P\u00a0= 0.76) and rates of 30-day reoperation (P\u00a0= 0.16) were similar between cohorts. On multivariate analysis, PRF was found to be a significant independent risk factor for longer hospital stays (risk ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.44-1.04; P < 0.001) but not postoperative complication or 30-day unplanned readmission.A retrospective cohort study was performed using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric database from 2016 to 2018. All pediatric patients with AIS undergoing PSF were identified. Patients were then categorized by whether they had recorded baseline PRF or no-PRF. Patient demographics, comorbidities, intraoperative variables, complications, length of stay, discharge disposition, and readmission rate were assessed.Our study showed that PRF may be a risk factor for slightly longer hospital stays without higher rates of complication or unplanned readmission for patients with AIS undergoing PSF and thus should not preclude surgical management.","606":"Infectious diseases are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality around the world; thus, forecasting their impact is crucial for planning an effective response strategy. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), seasonal influenza affects 5% to 20% of the U.S. population and causes major economic impacts resulting from hospitalization and absenteeism. Understanding influenza dynamics and forecasting its impact is fundamental for developing prevention and mitigation strategies. We combine modern data assimilation methods with Wikipedia access logs and CDC influenza-like illness (ILI) reports to create a weekly forecast for seasonal influenza. The methods are applied to the 2013-2014 influenza season but are sufficiently general to forecast any disease outbreak, given incidence or case count data. We adjust the initialization and parametrization of a disease model and show that this allows us to determine systematic model bias. In addition, we provide a way to determine where the model diverges from observation and evaluate forecast accuracy. Wikipedia article access logs are shown to be highly correlated with historical ILI records and allow for accurate prediction of ILI data several weeks before it becomes available. The results show that prior to the peak of the flu season, our forecasting method produced 50% and 95% credible intervals for the 2013-2014 ILI observations that contained the actual observations for most weeks in the forecast. However, since our model does not account for re-infection or multiple strains of influenza, the tail of the epidemic is not predicted well after the peak of flu season has passed.

A generalized linear model (GLM) was established to test the association between mobility volume (number of trips) and COVID-19 transmission. Subgroup analysis was also performed for sex, age, travel location, and travel distance. Statistical\u00a0interaction\u00a0terms were included\u00a0in a variety of models that express different relations between involved variables.This study aimed to quantify the impact of mobility reduction on COVID-19 transmission according to mobility distance, location, and demographic factors in order to identify hotspots of transmission and guide public health policies.Mobility restriction was one of the primary measures used to restrain the spread of COVID-19 globally. Governments implemented and relaxed various mobility restriction measures in the absence of evidence for almost 3 years, which caused severe adverse outcomes in terms of health, society, and economy.The GLM analysis demonstrated a significant association between the COVID-19 growth rate ratio (GR) and mobility volume. A stratification analysis revealed a higher effect of mobility volume on the COVID-19 GR among people aged 50-59 years (GR decrease of 13.17% per 10% reduction in mobility volume; P<.001) than among other age groups (GR decreases of 7.80%, 10.43%, 7.48%, 8.01%, and 10.43% for those aged \u226418, 19-29, 30-39, 40-49, and \u226560 years, respectively; P=.02 for the interaction). The impact of mobility reduction on COVID-19 transmission was higher for transit stations and shopping areas (instantaneous reproduction number [Rt] decreases of 0.67 and 0.53 per 10% reduction in mobility volume, respectively) than for workplaces, schools, recreation areas, and other locations (Rt decreases of 0.30, 0.37, 0.44, and 0.32, respectively; P=.02 for the interaction). The association between mobility volume reduction and COVID-19 transmission was lower with decreasing mobility distance as there was a significant interaction between mobility volume and mobility distance with regard to Rt (P<.001 for the interaction). Specifically, the percentage decreases in Rt per 10% reduction in mobility volume were 11.97% when mobility distance increased by 10% (Spring Festival), 6.74% when mobility distance remained unchanged, and 1.52% when mobility distance declined by 10%.The association between mobility reduction and COVID-19 transmission significantly varied according to mobility distance, location, and age. The substantially higher impact of mobility volume on COVID-19 transmission for longer travel distance, certain age groups, and specific travel locations highlights the potential to optimize the effectiveness of mobility restriction strategies. The results from our study demonstrate the power of having a mobility network using mobile phone data for surveillance that can monitor movement at a detailed level to measure the potential impacts of future pandemics.","609":"The COVID-19 pandemic has created a public health crisis. Because SARS-CoV-2 can spread from individuals with pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, and asymptomatic infections, the re-opening of societies and the control of virus spread will be facilitated by robust surveillance, for which virus testing will often be central. After infection, individuals undergo a period of incubation during which viral titers are usually too low to detect, followed by an exponential growth of virus, leading to a peak viral load and infectiousness, and ending with declining viral levels and clearance. Given the pattern of viral load kinetics, we model surveillance effectiveness considering test sensitivities, frequency, and sample-to-answer reporting time. These results demonstrate that effective surveillance, including time to first detection and outbreak control, depends largely on frequency of testing and the speed of reporting, and is only marginally improved by high test sensitivity. We therefore conclude that surveillance should prioritize accessibility, frequency, and sample-to-answer time; analytical limits of detection should be secondary.","610":"In the late 1990s, the San Miguel Island fox (Urocyon littoralis littoralis) faced near-extinction. Fourteen of the 15 remaining foxes were placed into an island-based captive breeding program used to repopulate the island. Although the fox population in San Miguel reached pre-decline numbers by 2010, a second decline started around 2014, coincidental with a newly observed acanthocephalan parasite that remained unidentified for over a decade. To identify this introduced acanthocephalan species and determine the pathologic consequences of its infection on the health of foxes, we used an extensive record of island fox necropsies and associated parasite collections. In addition, we used detailed fox capture-recapture data to investigate population health and demographic trends of foxes before and after parasite emergence. We identify the parasite as Pachysentis canicola, a common acanthocephalan in mainland foxes in North America. The parasite was detected in 69% of the necropsied foxes from San Miguel Island and was not found in any of the other five Channel Island fox subspecies. Health impacts attributed to the acanthocephalan parasite, including erosive and ulcerative enteritis, transmural necrosis, and inflammation, were described in 47% of the foxes infected with the acanthocephalan. Despite infection with various other helminth parasite species, body condition remained good and the mortality rate low in San Miguel Island foxes until the arrival of the acanthocephalan. Body condition improved after 2018, perhaps due to increases in rainfall following a drought, but remained 27% lower than the pre-acanthocephalan period, which suggests that environmental conditions and parasitism jointly drive fox population dynamics.","611":" The results of this study indicate a discordance between gut microbiome composition and evolutionary history in primates, calling into question previous notions about host genetic control of the primate gut microbiome. Microbiome similarities between humans consuming nonindustrialized diets and monkeys characterized by subsisting on eclectic, omnivorous diets also raise questions about the ecological and nutritional drivers shaping the human gut microbiome. Moreover, a more detailed understanding of the factors associated with gut microbiome plasticity in primates offers a framework to understand why humans following industrialized lifestyles have deviated from states thought to reflect human evolutionary history. The results also provide perspectives for developing therapeutic dietary manipulations that can reset configurations of the gut microbiome to potentially improve human health.","612":"Structural stigma shapes men who have sex with men's (MSM's) mental health and sexual behaviours. The aim of this study was to examine how stigmatizing policies interact with downstream anxiety\/depression and sexual behaviours to structurally pattern HIV disparities among European MSM. We conducted a secondary data analysis of the European Men-who-have-sex-with-men Internet Survey (EMIS) from 2017. We included a total of 98,600 participants living in 39 European countries. We used the Rainbow Index, a score given to countries based on their sexual and gender minority policies as the predictor of HIV diagnosis. We conducted adjusted random intercept and slope multi-level logistic regressions. In adjusted models, higher Rainbow Index scores was associated with lower predictive probabilities of diagnosed HIV, regardless of the number of condomless intercourse partners. The predictive probability of HIV diagnosis was also lower, regardless of severity of anxiety\/depression, where the Rainbow Index score was better. Country-level policies interact with downstream sexual behaviours and anxiety\/depression to structurally influence HIV diagnosis among MSM in Europe.","613":" Our analysis suggests that, due to the extensive precautions from the Bangladesh government and other humanitarian organizations, the coronavirus disease will be under control if the maintenance continues like this.

Many public health responses and modeled scenarios for COVID-19 outbreaks caused by SARSCoV-2 assume that infection results in an immune response that protects individuals from future infections or illness for some amount of time. The timescale of protection is a critical determinant of the future impact of the pathogen. The presence or absence of protective immunity due to infection or vaccination (when available) will affect future transmission and illness severity. The dynamics of immunity and nature of protection are relevant to discussions surrounding therapeutic use of convalescent sera as well as efforts to identify individuals with protective immunity. Here, we review the scientific literature on antibody immunity to coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 as well as the related SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and human endemic coronaviruses (HCoVs). We reviewed 1281 abstracts and identified 322 manuscripts relevant to 5 areas of focus: 1) antibody kinetics, 2) correlates of protection, 3) immunopathogenesis, 4) antigenic diversity and cross-reactivity, and 5) population seroprevalence. While studies of SARS-CoV-2 are necessary to determine immune responses to it, evidence from other coronaviruses can provide clues and guide future research.","615":"The rapid growth of urban population and numbers of private cars in this modern era, results in increasingly urgent transportation problem in cities throughout the world. Road traffic congestion is an omnipresent problem, which leads to delays, time loss, human stress, energy consumption, environmental pollution e.c.t. In order to decrease traffic congestion, there is a need for simulating and optimizing traffic control and improving traffic management. There are different ways for traffic congestion monitoring and analysis such as using video monitoring and surveillance systems, or static and dynamic sensors which allow traffic management in real time. There are also other methods using non real time analysis where traf?c congestion can be extracted from historical patterns of traf?c congestion. The historical patterns can be gained from the stored travel time and speed data. The goal of enhancing driver convenience is achieved by providing applications based on road traffic condition that mainly identifies congestion status. This paper presents a web application which uses live traffic congestion data from Google Maps traffic layer for real time congestion calculation. A technique utilized for estimating the level of congestion is image processing. The main objective is to provide an automated and yet interactive visualization tool for congestion analysis in real time. The aim is reducing the traffic congestion on roads which will lead to decrease in the number of accidents. It can provide important data which can help road traffic management. Thus, it is mainly dedicated to traffic managers, operators and analysts. Nevertheless it can be implemented also by road users. Unlike most sensor based applications, it makes quantified congestion data available even in regions with limited traffic data information.","616":"Drug resistance remains a concern for malaria control and elimination. The effect of interventions on its prevalence needs to be monitored to pre-empt further selection. We assessed the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum gene mutations associated with resistance to the antimalarial drugs: sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), chloroquine (CQ) and artemisinin combination therapy (ACTs) after the scale-up of a vector control activity that reduced transmission.A total of 400 P. falciparum isolates from children under five years were genotyped for seventeen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps and pfk13 genes using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and high resolution melting (HRM) analysis. These included 80 isolates, each randomly selected from cross-sectional surveys of asymptomatic infections across 2010 (baseline), 2011, 2012, 2013 (midline: post-IRS) and 2014 (endline: post-IRS) during the peak transmission season, when IRS intervention was rolled out in Bunkpurugu Yunyoo (BY) District, Ghana. The proportions of isolates with drug resistant alleles were assessed over this period.The study demonstrated declining trends in the prevalence of drug resistant mutations in asymptomatic P. falciparum infections following transmission reduction after an enhanced IRS intervention in Northern Ghana.There were significant decreases in the prevalence of pfdhfr- I51R59N108 haplotype from 2010 to 2014, while the decline in pfdhfr\/pfdhps- I51R59N108G437 during the same period was not significant. The prevalence of lumefantrine (LM), mefloquine (MQ) and amodiaquine (AQ) resistance-associated haplotypes pfmdr1-N86F184D1246 and pfmdr1-Y86Y184Y1246 showed decreasing trends (z = -2.86, P = 0.004 and z = -2.71, P = 0.007, respectively). Each of pfcrt-T76 and pfmdr1-Y86 mutant alleles also showed a declining trend in the asymptomatic reservoir, after the IRS rollout in 2014 (z = -2.87, P = 0.004 and z = -2.65, P = 0.008, respectively). Similarly, Pyrimethamine resistance mediating polymorphisms pfdhfr-N108, pfdhfr-I51 and pfdhfr-R59 also declined (z = -2.03, P = 0.042, z = -3.54, P<0.001 and z = -4.63, P<0.001, respectively), but not the sulphadoxine resistance mediating pfdhps-G437 and pfdhps-F436 (z = -0.36, P = 0.715 and z = 0.41, P = 0.684, respectively). No mutant pfk13-Y580 were detected during the study period.","617":"Monopolistic pricing models for revenue management are widely used in practice to set prices of multiple products with uncertain demand arrivals. The literature often assumes deterministic time of serving each demand and that the distribution of uncertainty is fully known. In this paper, we consider a new class of revenue management problems inspired by emerging applications such as cloud computing and city parking, where we dynamically determine prices for multiple products sharing limited resource and aim to maximize the expected revenue over a finite horizon. Random demand of each product arrives in each period, modeled by a function of the arrival time, product type, and price. Unlike the traditional monopolistic pricing, here each demand stays in the system for uncertain time. Both demand and service time follow ambiguous distributions, and we formulate robust deterministic approximation models to construct efficient heuristic fixed-price pricing policies. We conduct numerical studies by testing cloud computing service pricing instances based on data published by the Amazon Web Services (AWS) and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for managing revenue and risk under various distributions of demand and service time.","618":" IU\/ml).

Using patient EMR data as predictors, we derived hierarchical logistic regression (HLR) and standard logistic regression (LR) models to predict their relevance.Hierarchical models can yield better performance when there is physician-related variability as in the case of identifying relevant information in the EMR.Patient information can be retrieved more efficiently in electronic medical record (EMR) systems by using machine learning models that predict which information a physician will seek in a clinical context. However, information-seeking behavior varies across EMR users. To explicitly account for this variability, we derived hierarchical models and compared their performance to nonhierarchical models in identifying relevant patient information in intensive care unit (ICU) cases.In 73 pairs of HLR and LR models, the HLR models achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.80-0.82], which was statistically significantly higher than that of LR models (0.75, 95% CI [0.74-0.76]). Further, the HLR models achieved statistically significantly lower expected calibration error (0.07, 95% CI [0.06-0.08]) than LR models (0.16, 95% CI [0.14-0.17]).The physician reviewers demonstrated variability in selecting relevant data. Our results show that HLR models perform significantly better than LR models with respect to both discrimination and calibration. This is likely due to explicitly modeling physician-related variability.","620":"The use of open-source programming languages, such as R, in health decision sciences is growing and has the potential to facilitate model transparency, reproducibility, and shareability. However, realizing this potential can be challenging. Models are complex and primarily built to answer a research question, with model sharing and transparency relegated to being secondary goals. Consequently, code is often neither well documented nor systematically organized in a comprehensible and shareable approach. Moreover, many decision modelers are not formally trained in computer programming and may lack good coding practices, further compounding the problem of model transparency. To address these challenges, we propose a high-level framework for model-based decision and cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) in R. The proposed framework consists of a conceptual, modular structure and coding recommendations for the implementation of model-based decision analyses in R. This framework defines a set of common decision model elements divided into five components: (1) model inputs, (2) decision model implementation, (3) model calibration, (4) model validation, and (5) analysis. The first four components form the model development phase. The analysis component is the application of the fully developed decision model to answer the policy or the research question of interest, assess decision uncertainty, and\/or to determine the value of future research through value of information (VOI) analysis. In this framework, we also make recommendations for good coding practices specific to decision modeling, such as file organization and variable naming conventions. We showcase the framework through a fully functional, testbed decision model, which is hosted on GitHub for free download and easy adaptation to other applications. The use of this framework in decision modeling will improve code readability and model sharing, paving the way to an ideal, open-source world.","621":"Psychotropic polypharmacy during the initial phase of cancer care was associated with significantly increased healthcare resource utilization, and the proportion of patients receiving psychotropic polypharmacy differed by type of cancer.We used a claims database to identify adults with incident breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers diagnosed during 2011-12. Psychotropic polypharmacy was defined as concurrent use of two or more psychotropic medication classes for at least 90\u00a0days. A multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify significant predictors of psychotropic polypharmacy. Multivariable Poisson and negative binomial regressions were used to assess the associations between psychotropic polypharmacy and healthcare utilization.The use of psychotropic medications is not uncommon among patients with newly diagnosed cancer. However, the impact of psychotropic polypharmacy on healthcare utilization during the initial phase of cancer care is largely unknown.Findings emphasize the importance of evidence-based psychotropic prescribing and close surveillance of events causing increased healthcare utilization among patients with cancer receiving psychotropic polypharmacy.Among 5604 patients included in the study, 52.6% had breast cancer, 30.6% had prostate cancer, 11.4% had colorectal cancer, and 5.5% had lung cancer. During the year following incident cancer diagnosis, psychotropic polypharmacy was reported in 7.4% of patients, with the highest prevalence among patients with lung cancer (14.4%). Compared with patients without psychotropic polypharmacy during the initial phase of care, patients with newly diagnosed cancer with psychotropic polypharmacy had a 30% higher rate of physician office visits, an 18% higher rate of hospitalization, and a 30% higher rate of outpatient visits. The rate of emergency room visits was similar between the two groups.","622":"Indoor superspreading events are significant drivers of transmission of respiratory diseases. In this work, we study the dynamics of airborne transmission in consecutive meetings of individuals in enclosed spaces. In contrast to the usual pairwise-interaction models of infection where effective contacts transmit the disease, we focus on group interactions where individuals with distinct health states meet simultaneously. Specifically, the disease is transmitted by infected individuals exhaling droplets (contributing to the viral load in the closed space) and susceptible ones inhaling the contaminated air. We propose a modeling framework that couples the fast dynamics of the viral load attained over meetings in enclosed spaces and the slow dynamics of disease progression at the population level. Our modeling framework incorporates the multiple time scales involved in different setups in which indoor events may happen, from single-time events to events hosting multiple meetings per day, over many days. We present theoretical and numerical results of trade-offs between the room characteristics (ventilation system efficiency and air mass) and the group's behavioral and composition characteristics (group size, mask compliance, testing, meeting time, and break times), that inform indoor policies to achieve disease control in closed environments through different pathways. Our results emphasize the impact of break times, mask-wearing, and testing on facilitating the conditions to achieve disease control. We study scenarios of different break times, mask compliance, and testing. We also derive policy guidelines to contain the infection rate under a certain threshold.","623":"We performed a cross-sectional study to evaluate associations between methadone program participation and ART uptake and viral suppression (HIV RNA viral load <1000 copies\/ml) among PWID with HIV in Kenya. Participants were recruited from needle and syringe programs and methadone clinics, interviewed on site, and samples were obtained and assayed for HIV viral loads. Univariate and multiple logistic regression were used to determine associations.HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs (PWID) in Kenya is estimated to be 18% compared to 4.5% in the general population. Studies from high-income countries have demonstrated that methadone use is associated with increased uptake of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and higher rates of viral suppression among PWID with HIV. However, it is unclear whether methadone use has the same effect among African PWID living with HIV.In this study, Kenyan PWID living with HIV participating in a methadone treatment program were more likely to be on ART and to have achieved viral suppression. Scale-up of methadone programs may have a positive impact on HIV epidemic control for this key population.Among 679 participants, median age was 37\u00a0years, 48% were female, and 24% were in a methadone program. We observed higher proportions of ART use (96% vs. 87%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and HIV viral suppression (78% vs. 65%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.012) among PWID on methadone compared to those not on methadone treatment. PWID who were not participating in a methadone program were 3-fold more likely to be off ART and approximately twice as likely to be viremic compared to those in methadone programs (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]\u00a0=\u00a03.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.35-8.35 and aOR\u00a0=\u00a01.90, 95% CI: 1.03-3.52, respectively).","624":"The study objective is to estimate the epidemiological and economic impact of vaccine interventions during influenza pandemics in Chicago, and assist in vaccine intervention priorities. Scenarios of delay in vaccine introduction with limited vaccine efficacy and limited supplies are not unlikely in future influenza pandemics, as in the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. We simulated influenza pandemics in Chicago using agent-based transmission dynamic modeling. Population was distributed among high-risk and non-high risk among 0-19, 20-64 and 65+ years subpopulations. Different attack rate scenarios for catastrophic (30.15%), strong (21.96%), and moderate (11.73%) influenza pandemics were compared against vaccine intervention scenarios, at 40% coverage, 40% efficacy, and unit cost of $28.62. Sensitivity analysis for vaccine compliance, vaccine efficacy and vaccine start date was also conducted. Vaccine prioritization criteria include risk of death, total deaths, net benefits, and return on investment. The risk of death is the highest among the high-risk 65+ years subpopulation in the catastrophic influenza pandemic, and highest among the high-risk 0-19 years subpopulation in the strong and moderate influenza pandemics. The proportion of total deaths and net benefits are the highest among the high-risk 20-64 years subpopulation in the catastrophic, strong and moderate influenza pandemics. The return on investment is the highest in the high-risk 0-19 years subpopulation in the catastrophic, strong and moderate influenza pandemics. Based on risk of death and return on investment, high-risk groups of the three age group subpopulations can be prioritized for vaccination, and the vaccine interventions are cost saving for all age and risk groups. The attack rates among the children are higher than among the adults and seniors in the catastrophic, strong, and moderate influenza pandemic scenarios, due to their larger social contact network and homophilous interactions in school. Based on return on investment and higher attack rates among children, we recommend prioritizing children (0-19 years) and seniors (65+ years) after high-risk groups for influenza vaccination during times of limited vaccine supplies. Based on risk of death, we recommend prioritizing seniors (65+ years) after high-risk groups for influenza vaccination during times of limited vaccine supplies.","625":"Dengue is an infection of increasing global importance, yet uncertainty remains regarding critical aspects of its virology, immunology and epidemiology. One unanswered question is how infection is controlled and cleared during a dengue infection. Antibody is thought to play a role, but little past work has examined the kinetics of both virus and antibody during natural infections. We present data on multiple virus and antibody titres measurements recorded sequentially during infection from 53 Vietnamese dengue patients. We fit mechanistic mathematical models of the dynamics of viral replication and the host immune response to these data. These models fit the data well. The model with antibody removing virus fits the data best, but with a role suggested for ADCC or other infected cell clearance mechanisms. Our analysis therefore shows that the observed viral and antibody kinetics are consistent with antibody playing a key role in controlling viral replication. This work gives quantitative insight into the relationship between antibody levels and the efficiency of viral clearance. It will inform the future development of mechanistic models of how vaccines and antivirals might modify the course of natural dengue infection.","626":"Seasonal influenza results in substantial annual morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. Accurate forecasts of key features of influenza epidemics, such as the timing and severity of the peak incidence in a given season, can inform public health response to outbreaks. As part of ongoing efforts to incorporate data and advanced analytical methods into public health decision-making, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has organized seasonal influenza forecasting challenges since the 2013\/2014 season. In the 2017\/2018 season, 22 teams participated. A subset of four teams created a research consortium called the FluSight Network in early 2017. During the 2017\/2018 season they worked together to produce a collaborative multi-model ensemble that combined 21 separate component models into a single model using a machine learning technique called stacking. This approach creates a weighted average of predictive densities where the weight for each component is determined by maximizing overall ensemble accuracy over past seasons. In the 2017\/2018 influenza season, one of the largest seasonal outbreaks in the last 15 years, this multi-model ensemble performed better on average than all individual component models and placed second overall in the CDC challenge. It also outperformed the baseline multi-model ensemble created by the CDC that took a simple average of all models submitted to the forecasting challenge. This project shows that collaborative efforts between research teams to develop ensemble forecasting approaches can bring measurable improvements in forecast accuracy and important reductions in the variability of performance from year to year. Efforts such as this, that emphasize real-time testing and evaluation of forecasting models and facilitate the close collaboration between public health officials and modeling researchers, are essential to improving our understanding of how best to use forecasts to improve public health response to seasonal and emerging epidemic threats.","627":"From April to September 2020, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 infections in a cohort of 396 healthcare workers (HCWs) from five departments at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, South Africa. Overall, 34.6% of HCWs had PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (132.1 [95%CI: 111.8, 156.2] per 1,000 person-months), an additional 27 infections were identified by serology. HCWs in the Internal Medicine department had the highest rate of infection (61.7%). Among PCR-confirmed cases, 10.4% remained asymptomatic, 30.4% were pre-symptomatic and 59.3% symptomatic.","628":"Apixaban was a dominant treatment strategy compared with warfarin in AF patients with eGFR levels of 50 ml\/min or less and 50 to 80 ml\/min. In patients with an eGFR of more than 80 ml\/min, apixaban was cost-effective compared with warfarin, costing $6307 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Results were consistent assuming anticoagulant discontinuation after major bleeding events. Compared with dabigatran and rivaroxaban, apixaban was the only cost-effective anticoagulant strategy relative to warfarin in both mild and moderate renal impairment settings.Warfarin use for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients with chronic kidney disease is debated. Apixaban was shown to be safer than warfarin, with superior reduction in the risk of stroke, systemic embolism, mortality, and major bleeding irrespective of kidney function.To evaluate the cost-utility of apixaban compared with warfarin in AF patients at different levels of kidney function.A Markov model was used to estimate the cost effectiveness of apixaban compared with warfarin in AF patients at three levels of kidney function: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of more than 80 ml\/min, 50 to 80 ml\/min, and 50 ml\/min or less. Event rates and associated utilities were obtained from previous literature. The model adopted the US health care system perspective, with hospitalization costs extracted from the Healthcare and Utilization Project. Treatment costs were obtained from official price lists. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of results.Apixaban is a favorably cost-effective alternative to warfarin in AF patients with normal kidney function and potentially cost-saving in those with renal impairment.","629":"The factors that drive spatial heterogeneity and diffusion of pandemic influenza remain debated. We characterized the spatiotemporal mortality patterns of the 1918 influenza pandemic in British India and studied the role of demographic factors, environmental variables, and mobility processes on the observed patterns of spread. Fever-related and all-cause excess mortality data across 206 districts in India from January 1916 to December 1920 were analyzed while controlling for variation in seasonality particular to India. Aspects of the 1918 autumn wave in India matched signature features of influenza pandemics, with high disease burden among young adults, (moderate) spatial heterogeneity in burden, and highly synchronized outbreaks across the country deviating from annual seasonality. Importantly, we found population density and rainfall explained the spatial variation in excess mortality, and long-distance travel via railroad was predictive of the observed spatial diffusion of disease. A spatiotemporal analysis of mortality patterns during the 1918 influenza pandemic in India was integrated in this study with data on underlying factors and processes to reveal transmission mechanisms in a large, intensely connected setting with significant climatic variability. The characterization of such heterogeneity during historical pandemics is crucial to prepare for future pandemics.","630":"Globally to date, established international standards for animal welfare, a priority of sustainable agriculture, have primarily focused on large-scale producers. However, across Latin America, including in Ecuador's Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, smallholder farms play a critical role in food safety and security. We assessed five basic animal welfare measures (feed and water access, shelter availability and housing systems, animal health management, animal behavior, and timely euthanasia) for poultry, pigs, and cattle on Floreana Island, Gal\u00e1pagos. Utilizing assessment standards from multiple US sources and international standards, we developed a questionnaire and used it to conduct in-depth interviews during 4-5 July 2022 with eight participating producers, representing 75% of animal agriculture on Floreana. While we identified opportunities to enhance competencies in animal health management and timely euthanasia, farms performed well in the other assessed measures. Future work should promote knowledge transfer and in-country capacity building in farm biosecurity, access to veterinary care, antimicrobial resistance surveillance, and euthanasia methods. Efforts to positively impact smallholder farm livelihoods in Gal\u00e1pagos-one of the most biodiverse and protected ecosystems on the planet-will sustainably support human health through the interconnected realms of animal health and welfare, wildlife and environmental health, and food safety and security.","631":"We develop a novel approach to study an outbreak of Q fever in 2009 in the Netherlands by combining a human dose-response model with geostatistics prediction to relate probability of infection and associated probability of illness to an effective dose of Coxiella burnetii. The spatial distribution of the 220 notified cases in the at-risk population are translated into a smooth spatial field of dose. Based on these symptomatic cases, the dose-response model predicts a median of 611 asymptomatic infections (95% range: 410, 1,084) for the 220 reported symptomatic cases in the at-risk population; 2.78 (95% range: 1.86, 4.93) asymptomatic infections for each reported case. The low attack rates observed during the outbreak range from (Equation is included in full-text article.)to (Equation is included in full-text article.). The estimated peak levels of exposure extend to the north-east from the point source with an increasing proportion of asymptomatic infections further from the source. Our work combines established methodology from model-based geostatistics and dose-response modeling allowing for a novel approach to study outbreaks. Unobserved infections and the spatially varying effective dose can be predicted using the flexible framework without assuming any underlying spatial structure of the outbreak process. Such predictions are important for targeting interventions during an outbreak, estimating future disease burden, and determining acceptable risk levels.","632":"De-identification is a critical technology to facilitate the use of unstructured clinical text while protecting patient privacy and confidentiality. The clinical natural language processing (NLP) community has invested great efforts in developing methods and corpora for de-identification of clinical notes. These annotated corpora are valuable resources for developing automated systems to de-identify clinical text at local hospitals. However, existing studies often utilized training and test data collected from the same institution. There are few studies to explore automated de-identification under cross-institute settings. The goal of this study is to examine deep learning-based de-identification methods at a cross-institute setting, identify the bottlenecks, and provide potential solutions.We created a de-identification corpus using a total 500 clinical notes from the University of Florida (UF) Health, developed deep learning-based de-identification models using 2014 i2b2\/UTHealth corpus, and evaluated the performance using UF corpus. We compared five different word embeddings trained from the general English text, clinical text, and biomedical literature, explored lexical and linguistic features, and compared two strategies to customize the deep learning models using UF notes and resources.It is necessary to customize de-identification models using local clinical text and other resources when applied in cross-institute settings. Fine-tuning is a potential solution to re-use pre-trained parameters and reduce the training time to customize deep learning-based de-identification models trained using clinical corpus from a different institution.Pre-trained word embeddings using a general English corpus achieved better performance than embeddings from de-identified clinical text and biomedical literature. The performance of deep learning models trained using only i2b2 corpus significantly dropped (strict and relax F1 scores dropped from 0.9547 and 0.9646 to 0.8568 and 0.8958) when applied to another corpus annotated at UF Health. Linguistic features could further improve the performance of de-identification in cross-institute settings. After customizing the models using UF notes and resource, the best model achieved the strict and relaxed F1 scores of 0.9288 and 0.9584, respectively.","633":"Assuming the same pricing, seasonal mAb programs are cost-effective over year-round programs in Norway. The timing and duration of the cost-effective seasonal program are sensitive to the pattern of the RSV season in a country, so continued RSV surveillance data are essential.We estimate an annual average of 13\u00a0517 RSV cases and 1572 hospitalizations in children under 5, resulting in 79.6 million Norwegian kroner (~\u20ac8 million) treatment costs. At \u20ac51 per dose for all programs, a 4-month mAb program for neonates born in November to February is the cost-effective strategy for willingness to pay (WTP) values up to \u20ac40\u00a0000 per QALY gained. For higher WTP values, the longer 6-month mAb program that immunizes neonates from October to March becomes cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses show that year-round maternal immunization can become a cost-effective strategy if priced lower than mAb.Every winter, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease results in thousands of cases in Norwegian children under 5 years of age. We aim to assess the RSV-related economic burden and the cost-effectiveness of upcoming RSV disease prevention strategies including year-round maternal immunization and year-round and seasonal monoclonal antibody (mAb) programs.Epidemiological and cost data were obtained from Norwegian national registries, while quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost and intervention characteristics were extracted from literature and phase 3 clinical trials. A static model was used and uncertainty was accounted for probabilistically. Value of information was used to assess decision uncertainty. Extensive scenario analyses were conducted, including accounting for long-term consequences of RSV disease.","634":"The Covid-19 pandemic has been characterized by the emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants, each with distinct properties influencing transmission dynamics, immune escape, and virulence, which, in turn, influence their impact on local populations. Swift analysis of the properties of newly emerged variants is essential in the initial days and weeks to enhance readiness and facilitate the scaling of clinical and public health system responses.The model successfully estimated key epidemiological parameters; we estimated the ascertainment rate of 0.22 (95% credible interval 0.15-0.29) and transmission rate of 5.0 (95% CI 2.4-6.6) for the Omicron variant.This paper introduces a two-variant metapopulation compartmental model of disease transmission to simulate the dynamics of disease transmission during a period of transition to a newly dominant strain. Leveraging novel S-gene dropout analysis data and genomic sequencing data, combined with confirmed Covid-19 case data, we estimate the epidemiological characteristics of the Omicron variant, which replaced the Delta variant in late 2021 in Philadelphia, PA. We utilized a grid-search method to identify plausible combinations of model parameters, followed by an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter for parameter inference.The study demonstrates the potential for this model-inference framework to provide real-time insights during the emergence of novel variants, aiding in timely public health responses.","635":"A problem extension of the longest common substring (LCS) between two texts is the enumeration of all LCSs given a minimum length k (ALCS- k ), along with their positions in each text. In bioinformatics, an efficient solution to the ALCS- k for very long texts -genomes or metagenomes- can provide useful insights to discover genetic signatures responsible for biological mechanisms. The ALCS- k problem has two additional requirements compared to the LCS problem: one is the minimum length k , and the other is that all common strings longer than k must be reported. We present an efficient, two-stage ALCS- k algorithm exploiting the spectrum of text substrings of length k ( k -mers). Our approach yields a worst-case time complexity loglinear in the number of k -mers for the first stage, and an average-case loglinear in the number of common k -mers for the second stage (several orders of magnitudes smaller than the total k -mer spectrum). The space complexity is linear in the first phase (disk-based), and on average linear in the second phase (disk- and memory-based). Tests performed on genomes for different organisms (including viruses, bacteria and animal chromosomes) show that run times are consistent with our theoretical estimates; further, comparisons with MUMmer4 show an asymptotic advantage with divergent genomes.","636":"Few prospective studies have documented the seropositivity among those children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. From 2 April 2021 to 24 June 2021, we prospectively enrolled children between the ages of 2 and 17\u00a0years at three North Carolina healthcare systems. Participants received at least four at-home serological tests detecting the presence of antibodies against, but not differentiating between, the nucleocapsid or spike antigen. A total of 1,058 participants were enrolled in the study, completing 2,709 tests between 1 May 2021 and 31 October 2021. Using multilevel regression with poststratification techniques and considering our assay sensitivity and sensitivity, we estimated that the seroprevalence of infection-induced antibodies among unvaccinated children and adolescents aged 2-17\u00a0years in North Carolina increased from 15.2% (95% credible interval, CrI 9.0-22.0) in May 2021 to 54.1% (95% CrI 46.7-61.1) by October 2021, indicating an average infection-to-reported-case ratio of 5. A rapid rise in seropositivity was most pronounced in those unvaccinated children aged 12-17\u00a0years, based on our estimates. This study underlines the utility of serial, serological testing to inform a broader understanding of the regional immune landscape and spread of infection.","637":"We identified the frequent drugsets from individual substance use database, and determined their representation among different demographic groups at different intervals. An interesting pattern of use of pain relievers and tranquilizers was detected for the age-group of 26-34 years. In addition, transition rules for heroin use in the last decade (2004-2015) of the given data were mined.Computation of weighted supports over time for every possible combination of substances in the survey, and their association with specific user groups, allows PSUMAnT to generate and test novel, interesting hypotheses in polysubstance use. PSUMAnT can be used for mining combinations of substances used among diverse demographic groups including those that have received less attention in this problem.To identify patterns of association and transition in polysubstance use based on National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) in the United States.We developed a new computational platform for PolySubstance Use data Mining for Associations and Transitions (PSUMAnT). It is based on the computation of weighted support, a measure of popularity, for the use of every combination of one or more substances, termed as a drugset, over a period of 5 decades (1965-2014) based on NSDUH data. It uses an efficient bitstring representation with exact and approximate string matching capabilities to search for patterns of association between drugsets and demographics of user groups at different time-intervals. Moreover, it introduces a quantitative definition of a rule of transition between pairs of substances used within a given time-interval, and provides a function for mining them.","638":" ) below 1 consistently; if introduced one week earlier it could have reduced deaths in the first wave from an estimated 48,600 to 25,600 (95% credible interval [95%CrI]: 15,900-38,400). The infection fatality ratio decreased from 1.00% (95%CrI: 0.85%-1.21%) to 0.79% (95%CrI: 0.63%-0.99%), suggesting improved clinical care. The infection fatality ratio was higher in the elderly residing in care homes (23.3%, 95%CrI: 14.7%-35.2%) than those residing in the community (7.9%, 95%CrI: 5.9%-10.3%). On 2nd December 2020 England was still far from herd immunity, with regional cumulative infection incidence between 7.6% (95%CrI: 5.4%-10.2%) and 22.3% (95%CrI: 19.4%-25.4%) of the population. Therefore, any vaccination campaign will need to achieve high coverage and a high degree of protection in vaccinated individuals to allow non-pharmaceutical interventions to be lifted without a resurgence of transmission.","639":"Rapid point-of-care tests that diagnose gonococcal infections and identify susceptibility to antibiotics enable individualized treatment. This could improve patient outcomes and slow the emergence and spread of resistance. However, little is known about the long-term impact of such diagnostics on the burden of gonorrhea and the effective lifespan of antibiotics. We used a mathematical model of gonorrhea transmission among men who have sex with men in the US to project the annual rate of reported gonorrhea cases and the effective lifespan of ceftriaxone, the recommended antibiotic for the first-line treatment of gonorrhea, as well as two previously recommended antibiotics, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline, when a rapid drug susceptibility test (DST) that reports susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and tetracycline is available. The use of a rapid DST with \u226550% sensitivity and \u226595% specificity, defined in terms of correct ascertainment of drug susceptibility and non-susceptibility status, could increase the combined effective lifespan of ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and ceftriaxone by at least 2 years over 25 years of simulation. If test specificity is imperfect, however, the increase in the effective lifespan of antibiotics is accompanied by an increase in the rate of reported gonorrhea cases even under perfect sensitivity.","640":"Face mask mandates were an effective way to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in local jurisdictions and in neighboring jurisdictions in Utah. Our evidence supports the use of face mask mandates as a way to prevent disease transmission and be better equipped to respond to future pandemics.We used publicly available data from the Utah Department of Health and Human Services. We calculated the effectiveness of face mask mandates (EFm) in each local health district after 3 key mandates: the enactment of face mask mandates in Salt Lake and Summit counties (SLSC) on June 28, 2020, and June 27, 2020, respectively; the enactment of a statewide face mask mandate on November 9, 2020; and the lifting of the statewide face mask mandate on April 10, 2021.Most counties in Utah had a reduction in the growth rate of COVID-19 cases after enactment of face mask mandates. We found an average 11.9% reduction in EFm after the introduction of the SLSC face mask mandates, with 8 of 13 local health districts experiencing a reduction, and an average 12.7% reduction after introduction of the statewide mandate, with 12 of 13 local health districts experiencing a reduction. After mandates were lifted, many counties had an increase in EFm.Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the effectiveness of face mask mandates was intensely debated. The objective of this study was to describe how face mask mandates at the state, county, and local levels differed in their effectiveness in reducing the number of COVID-19 cases in the jurisdiction where the mandate was implemented and throughout Utah.","641":"Elevated blood pressure presents a global health threat, with rates of hypertension increasing in low and middle-income countries. Lifestyle changes may be an important driver of these increases in blood pressure. Hypertension is particularly prevalent in African countries, though the majority of studies have focused on mainland Africa. We collected demographic and health data from 513 adults living in a community in rural Madagascar. We used generalized linear mixed models to assess body mass index (BMI), age, sex, and attributes related to household composition and lifestyle as predictors of blood pressure and hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension in this cohort was 49.1% (both sexes combined: N = 513; females: 50.3%, N = 290; males: 47.5%, N = 223). Blood pressure, as well as hypertensive state, was positively associated with age and BMI. Lifestyle and household factors had no significant relationships with blood pressure. The prevalence of hypertension was similar to that found in urban centers of other African countries, yet almost double what has been previously found in Madagascar. Future research should investigate the drivers of hypertension in rural communities worldwide, as well as the lifestyle, cultural, and genetic factors that underlie variation in hypertension across space and time.","642":"By 2020, 70% of people living with HIV in the United States will be greater than 50\u00a0years of age. As many as 37% of sexually active older people living with HIV (OPLWH) engage in HIV transmission sexual behaviors. In spite of repeated calls for secondary prevention interventions to reduce condomless sex in OPLWH, no age-appropriate, evidence-based secondary prevention interventions exist for this group. Furthermore, many OPLWH face barriers to engaging in face-to-face secondary prevention services because of HIV- and age-related stigma, comorbid mental and physical health conditions that complicate travel, or geographic isolation. High rates of depression in OPLWH may further complicate engagement in interventions intended to reduce HIV transmissions. Telephone-administered motivational interviewing may be a feasible and efficacious intervention for this population.This randomized controlled trial will test the efficacy of a 5-session telephone-administered motivational interviewing plus behavioral skills training (teleMI+BST) intervention versus a 5-session telephone-administered coping effectiveness training (teleCET) control intervention to reduce condomless sex in OPLWH. A diverse sample of 336 OPLWH will be recruited across the U.S. The primary analysis will test the efficacy of teleMI+BST to reduce occasions of non-condom protected anal and vaginal intercourse with HIV serodiscordant sex partners. Secondary analyses will examine the efficacy of teleMI+BST to reduce depressive symptoms in mildly depressed OPLWH.This is the first large-scale RCT intended to reduce HIV sexual transmission risk behavior in OPLWH and will add to the literature on secondary prevention telehealth interventions for people living with HIV. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03004170. This trial has been conducted by the approval of the Institutional Review Board. Participants provided verbal consent to participate in this trial.","643":"We conducted a review of cohort studies that reported the prevalence of arthralgia post-CHIKV infection over multiple time points. Generalized linear models were used to estimate the average rate of arthralgia resolution following CHIKV infection.We derive estimates of the average rate of arthralgia resolution and the expected prevalence of arthralgia over time post-CHIKV infection. These can help inform expectations regarding the long-term public health burdens associated with CHIKV epidemics.Sixteen cohort studies matching the inclusion criteria were identified and included in the analysis. We estimate an average rate of arthralgia resolution of 10.85% (95%CI: 9.05-12.66%) per month across studies, corresponding to an expected median time to arthralgia resolution of 6.39 months (95%CI: 5.48-7.66) and an expected arthralgia prevalence of 72.21% (95%CI: 68.40-76.23%) at 3 months post-CHIKV infection.Arthralgia, persistent pain or stiffness of joints, is the hallmark symptom of chronic chikungunya virus (CHIKV) disease. Associated with significant disability and reduced quality of life, arthralgia can persist for many months following CHIKV infection. Understanding the expected duration of arthralgia persistence is important for managing clinical expectations at the individual-level as well as for estimating long-term burdens on population health following a CHIKV epidemic.","644":"Recent studies indicate that treatment of chronic hepatitis D virus (HDV) with either pegylated interferon (IFN)\u03bb or pegylated IFN\u03b1 monotherapy leads to a dramatic decline in HDV RNA. Herein, we investigated the innate antiviral efficacy of IFN\u03bb and IFN\u03b1 in humanized mice that lack an adaptive immune response. Humanized mice were either co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV simultaneously, or HDV infection was performed subsequent to HBV infection (i.e., superinfected). After steady viral replication was achieved, mice received either IFN\u03bb (n=6) or IFN\u03b1 (n=7) for 12 (or 13) weeks. Pretreatment median levels of serum HBV DNA (8.8 [IQR:0.2] log IU\/ml), HDV RNA (9.8 [0.5] log IU\/ml), HBsAg (4.0 [0.4] log IU\/ml) and human albumin, hAlb (6.9 [0.1] log ng\/mL) were similar between mice treated with IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03bb and between those coinfected versus superinfected. Compared to mice treated with IFN\u03bb, mice treated with IFN\u03b1 had a significantly greater decline in HBV, HDV, and HBsAg levels. In conclusion, IFN\u03b1 induces stronger inhibition of HBV and HDV than IFN\u03bb in humanized mice that lack an adaptive immune response. Further studies are needed to assess the respective role of the combined innate-and adaptive-immune systems in the treatment of HBV and HDV with IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03bb.","645":"The Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group (ARLG) has prioritized infections caused by gram-positive bacteria as one of its core areas of emphasis. The ARLG Gram-positive Committee has focused on studies responding to 3 main identified research priorities: (1) investigation of strategies or therapies for infections predominantly caused by gram-positive bacteria, (2) evaluation of the efficacy of novel agents for infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and (3) optimization of dosing and duration of antimicrobial agents for gram-positive infections. Herein, we summarize ARLG accomplishments in gram-positive bacterial infection research, including studies aiming to (1) inform optimal vancomycin dosing, (2) determine the role of dalbavancin in MRSA bloodstream infection, (3) characterize enterococcal bloodstream infections, (4) demonstrate the benefits of short-course therapy for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia, (5) develop quality of life measures for use in clinical trials, and (6) advance understanding of the microbiome. Future studies will incorporate innovative methodologies with a focus on interventional clinical trials that have the potential to change clinical practice for difficult-to-treat infections, such as MRSA bloodstream infections.","646":"Insecticide to prevent chikungunya and dengue in Columbia could generate significant health benefits and be cost-effective. Because of limits on diagnostic accuracy and vaccine efficacy, the cost of dengue testing and vaccination must decrease dramatically for such vaccination to be cost-effective in Colombia. The vectors for chikungunya and dengue have recently spread to new regions, highlighting the importance of understanding the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of policies aimed at preventing these diseases.We evaluated the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of residual insecticide treatment, long-lasting insecticide-treated nets, routine dengue vaccination for children aged 9, catchup vaccination for individuals aged 10-19 or 10-29, and portfolios of these interventions. Model calibration resulted in 300 realistic transmission parameters sets that produced close matches to disease-specific incidence and deaths. Insecticide was the preferred intervention and was cost-effective. Insecticide averted an estimated 95 chikungunya cases and 114 dengue cases per 100,000 people, 61 deaths, and 4,523 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). In sensitivity analysis, strategies that included dengue vaccination were cost-effective only when the vaccine cost was 14% of the current price.Chikungunya and dengue are emerging diseases that have caused large outbreaks in various regions of the world. Both are both spread by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitos. We developed a dynamic transmission model of chikungunya and dengue, calibrated to data from Colombia (June 2014 -December 2017).","647":"Despite the existence of standard protocol, many stabilization centers (SCs) continue to experience high mortality of children receiving treatment for severe acute malnutrition. Assessing treatment outcomes and identifying predictors may help to overcome this problem. Therefore, a 30-month retrospective cohort study was conducted among 545 randomly selected medical records of children <5 years of age admitted to SCs in Gedeo Zone. Data was entered by Epi Info version 7 and analyzed by STATA version 11. Cox proportional hazards model was built by forward stepwise procedure and compared by the likelihood ratio test and Harrell's concordance, and fitness was checked by Cox-Snell residual plot. During follow-up, 51 (9.3%) children had died, and 414 (76%) and 26 (4.8%) children had recovered and defaulted (missed follow-up for 2 consecutive days), respectively. The survival rates at the end of the first, second and third weeks were 95.3%, 90% and 85%, respectively, and the overall mean survival time was 79.6 days. Age <24 months (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] =2.841, 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.101-7.329), altered pulse rate (AHR =3.926, 95% CI =1.579-9.763), altered temperature (AHR =7.173, 95% CI =3.05-16.867), shock (AHR =3.805, 95% CI =1.829-7.919), anemia (AHR =2.618, 95% CI =1.148-5.97), nasogastric tube feeding (AHR =3.181, 95% CI =1.18-8.575), hypoglycemia (AHR =2.74, 95% CI =1.279-5.87) and treatment at hospital stabilization center (AHR =4.772, 95% CI =1.638-13.9) were independent predictors of mortality. The treatment outcomes and incidence of death were in the acceptable ranges of national and international standards. Intervention to further reduce deaths has to focus on young children with comorbidities and altered general conditions.","648":"Markov decision analysis.Current pneumococcal vaccination recommendations for US older people are economically unfavorable compared to an alternative strategy omitting PCV13 in the immunocompetent. The alternative recommendation with an uptake improvement program may be economically reasonable in black population analyses and could be worth considering as a population-wide recommendation if mitigating racial disparities is a priority.The current pneumococcal vaccination recommendation was the most effective strategy, but afforded slight public health benefits compared to an alternative (PPSV23 for all older people plus PCV13 for the immunocompromised) and cost greater than $750 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained in either population group with a vaccine uptake improvement program (absolute uptake increase = 12.3%; cost = $1.78\/eligible patient) in place. The alternative strategy was more economically favorable, but cost greater than $100 000\/QALY in either population, with or without an uptake intervention. Results were robust in sensitivity analyses; however, in black older people, the alternative strategy with an uptake program was most likely to be favored in probabilistic sensitivity analyses at a $150 000\/QALY gained threshold.Recently revised vaccination recommendations for US adults, aged 65\u2009years and older, include both 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), with PCV13 now recommended for immunocompetent older people based on shared decision making. The public health impact and cost-effectiveness of this recommendation or of pneumococcal vaccine uptake improvement interventions are unclear.Hypothetical 65-year-old general and black population cohorts.Current pneumococcal vaccination recommendations for US older people, an alternative policy omitting PCV13 in immunocompetent older people, and vaccine uptake improvement programs.","649":"Here, we combine international air travel passenger data with a standard epidemiological model of the initial 3\u00a0mo of the COVID-19 pandemic (January through March 2020; toward the end of which the entire world locked down). Using the information available during this initial phase of the pandemic, our model accurately describes the main features of the actual global development of the pandemic demonstrated by the high degree of coherence between the model and global data. The validated model allows for an exploration of alternative policy efficacies (reducing air travel and\/or introducing different degrees of compulsory immigration quarantine upon arrival to a country) in delaying the global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and thus is suggestive of similar efficacy in anticipating the spread of future global disease outbreaks. We show that a lesson from the recent pandemic is that reducing air travel globally is more effective in reducing the global spread than adopting immigration quarantine. Reducing air travel out of a source country has the most important effect regarding the spreading of the disease to the rest of the world. Based upon our results, we propose a digital twin as a further developed tool to inform future pandemic decision-making to inform measures intended to control the spread of disease agents of potential future pandemics. We discuss the design criteria for such a digital twin model as well as the feasibility of obtaining access to the necessary online data on international air travel.","650":"Counting the number of species, items, or genes that are shared between two groups, sets, or communities is a simple calculation when sampling is complete. However, when only partial samples are available, quantifying the overlap between two communities becomes an estimation problem. Furthermore, to calculate normalized measures of \u03b2-diversity, such as the Jaccard and Sorenson-Dice indices, one must also estimate the total sizes of the communities being compared. Previous efforts to address these problems have assumed knowledge of total community sizes and then used Bayesian methods to produce unbiased estimates with quantified uncertainty. Here, we address communities of unknown size and show that this produces systematically better estimates-both in terms of central estimates and quantification of uncertainty in those estimates. We further show how to use species, item, or gene count data to refine estimates of community size in a Bayesian joint model of community size and overlap.","651":"Community testing programs focused on the unvaccinated population are being enacted in populations with mixed vaccination status to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread. Presumably, these policies assume that the unvaccinated are driving transmission, though it is not well understood how viral spread occurs in mixed-status populations. Here, we analyze a model of transmission in which a variable fraction of the population is vaccinated, with unvaccinated individuals proactively screened for infection. By exploring a range of transmission rates, vaccine effectiveness (VE) scenarios, and rates of prior infection, this analysis reveals principles of viral spread in communities of mixed vaccination status, with implications for screening policies. As vaccination rates increase, the proportion of transmission driven by the unvaccinated population decreases, such that most community spread is driven by breakthrough infections once vaccine coverage exceeds 55% (omicron) or 80% (delta), with additional variation dependent on waning or boosted VE. More broadly, the potential impacts of unvaccinated-only screening fall into three distinct parameter regions: (I) \"flattening the curve\" with little impact on cumulative infections, (II) effectively suppressing transmission, and (III) negligible impact because herd immunity is reached without screening. By evaluating a wide range of scenarios, this work finds broadly that effective mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by unvaccinated-only screening is highly dependent on vaccination rate, population-level immunity, screening compliance, and vaccine effectiveness against the current variant.","652":"Given a large attributed social network, can we find a compact, diffusion-equivalent representation while keeping the attribute properties? Diffusion networks with user attributes such as friendship, email communication, and people contact networks are increasingly common-place in the real-world. However, analyzing them is challenging due to their large size. In this paper, we first formally formulate a novel problem of summarizing an attributed diffusion graph to preserve its attributes and influence-based properties. Next, we propose ANeTS, an effective sub-quadratic parallelizable algorithm to solve this problem: it finds the best set of candidate nodes and merges them to construct a smaller network of \u0091super-nodes\u0092 preserving the desired properties. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that ANeTS outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines (some of which do not even finish in 14 days). Finally, we show how ANeTS helps in multiple applications such as Topic-Aware viral marketing and sense-making of diverse graphs from different domains.","653":"We constructed 3 stochastic mechanistic models that considered both between- and within-host dynamics of susceptible and resistant gram-negative bacteria, to identify circumstances under which shortening antibiotic duration would lead to reduced resistance carriage. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis of antibiotic treatment duration trials, which monitored resistant gram-negative bacteria carriage as an outcome. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for randomised controlled trials published from 1 January 2000 to 4 October 2022, which allocated participants to varying durations of systemic antibiotic treatments. Quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials. The meta-analysis was performed using logistic regression. Duration of antibiotic treatment and time from administration of antibiotics to surveillance culture were included as independent variables. Both the mathematical modelling and meta-analysis suggested modest reductions in resistance carriage could be achieved by reducing antibiotic treatment duration. The models showed that shortening duration is most effective at reducing resistance carriage in high compared to low transmission settings. For treated individuals, shortening duration is most effective when resistant bacteria grow rapidly under antibiotic selection pressure and decline rapidly when stopping treatment. Importantly, under circumstances whereby administered antibiotics can suppress colonising bacteria, shortening antibiotic treatment may increase the carriage of a particular resistance phenotype. We identified 206 randomised trials, which investigated antibiotic duration. Of these, 5 reported resistant gram-negative bacteria carriage as an outcome and were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis determined that a single additional antibiotic treatment day is associated with a 7% absolute increase in risk of resistance carriage (80% credible interval 3% to 11%). Interpretation of these estimates is limited by the low number of antibiotic duration trials that monitored carriage of resistant gram-negative bacteria, as an outcome, contributing to a large credible interval.In this study, we found both theoretical and empirical evidence that reducing antibiotic treatment duration can reduce resistance carriage, though the mechanistic models also highlighted circumstances under which reducing treatment duration can, perversely, increase resistance. Future antibiotic duration trials should monitor antibiotic-resistant bacteria colonisation as an outcome to better inform antibiotic stewardship policies.Reducing antibiotic treatment duration is a key component of hospital antibiotic stewardship interventions. However, its effectiveness in reducing antimicrobial resistance is uncertain and a clear theoretical rationale for the approach is lacking. In this study, we sought to gain a mechanistic understanding of the relation between antibiotic treatment duration and the prevalence of colonisation with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospitalised patients.","654":"Measles remains a major public health burden worldwide. Parents often hesitate to vaccinate children with chronic diseases. We investigated the association between the percentage of vaccination and chronic diseases and explore hospital infections' role in the 2017-2019 measles outbreak across northern Vietnam provinces.The incidence rate that provincial hospitals sent to the National Children's Hospital was proportional to the population density of their provinces of residence. Early nosocomial transmission of measles was observed before community-acquired cases emerged in many provinces. Among patients aged over 18 months, those with chronic diseases had a proportion of vaccination of 9.4%, lower than patients without chronic diseases at 32.4%. Unvaccinated patients had a higher proportion of hospital-acquired infections with aOR\u2009=\u20092.42 (1.65-3.65), p\u2009<\u20090.001 relative to vaccinated patients. The proportion of hospital-acquired infections was higher among children with chronic diseases compared to those without, with aOR\u2009=\u20093.81 (2.90-5.02), p\u2009<\u20090.001.Measles spread in healthcare settings prior to community cases that occurred in several provinces. We recommend enhancing hospital infection control by increasing staff training and improving early detection and isolation during non-outbreak periods. Measles patients with chronic diseases exhibited lower proportions of vaccination and faced a higher risk of hospital-acquired infections. It is crucial to establish comprehensive vaccination guidelines and enhance parental awareness regarding the significance and safety of measles vaccination to protect these vulnerable individuals.A total of 2,064 children aged 0-15 years old admitted for measles to the National Children's Hospital during the outbreak were included in the study. Demographic information, clinical characteristics, vaccination statuses and laboratory examination were extracted from electronic medical records, vaccination records, or interviews with parents when other sources were unavailable.","655":"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a common problem in the world, especially in China. More than 60-80% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases can be attributed to HBV infection in high HBV prevalent regions. Although traditional Sanger sequencing has been extensively used to investigate HBV sequences, NGS is becoming more commonly used. Further, it is unknown whether word pattern frequencies of HBV reads by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) can be used to investigate HBV genotypes and predict HCC status. In this study, we used NGS to sequence the pre-S region of the HBV sequence of 94 HCC patients and 45 chronic HBV (CHB) infected individuals. Word pattern frequencies among the sequence data of all individuals were calculated and compared using the Manhattan distance. The individuals were grouped using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and hierarchical clustering. Word pattern frequencies were also used to build prediction models for HCC status using both K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM). We showed the extremely high power of analyzing HBV sequences using word patterns. Our key findings include that the first principal coordinate of the PCoA analysis was highly associated with the fraction of genotype B (or C) sequences and the second principal coordinate was significantly associated with the probability of having HCC. Hierarchical clustering first groups the individuals according to their major genotypes followed by their HCC status. Using cross-validation, high area under the receiver operational characteristic curve (AUC) of around 0.88 for KNN and 0.92 for SVM were obtained. In the independent data set of 46 HCC patients and 31 CHB individuals, a good AUC score of 0.77 was obtained using SVM. It was further shown that 3000 reads for each individual can yield stable prediction results for SVM. Thus, another key finding is that word patterns can be used to predict HCC status with high accuracy. Therefore, our study shows clearly that word pattern frequencies of HBV sequences contain much information about the composition of different HBV genotypes and the HCC status of an individual.","656":" were associated with longer epidemic duration.

The spatiotemporal relationships of ET with rainfall and vegetation dynamics in the Nile Basin during 2002\u00962011 were analyzed using satellite-derived data. Non-parametric statistics were used to quantify ET-rainfall interactions and trends across land cover types and subbasins. We found that 65% of the study area (2.5 million km2) showed significant (p < 0.05) positive correlations between monthly ET and rainfall, whereas 7% showed significant negative correlations. As expected, positive ET-rainfall correlations were observed over natural vegetation, mixed croplands\/natural vegetation, and croplands, with a few subbasin-specific exceptions. In particular, irrigated croplands, wetlands and some forests exhibited negative correlations. Trend tests revealed spatial clusters of statistically significant trends in ET (6% of study area was negative; 12% positive), vegetation greenness (24% negative; 12% positive) and rainfall (11% negative; 1% positive) during 2002\u00962011. The Nile Delta, Ethiopian highlands and central Uganda regions showed decline in ET while central parts of Sudan, South Sudan, southwestern Ethiopia and northeastern Uganda showed increases. Except for a decline in ET in central Uganda, the detected changes in ET (both positive and negative) were not associated with corresponding changes in rainfall. Detected declines in ET in the Nile delta and Ethiopian highlands were found to be attributable to anthropogenic land degradation, while the ET decline in central Uganda is likely caused by rainfall reduction","659":"References were searched in PubMed and Google Scholar electronic databases on January 21, 2020, using selected keywords, without language and date restriction.

This review highlights the needs for further research and coordinated surveillance efforts on WNV in Africa.West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus which has been posing continuous challenges to public health worldwide due to the identification of new lineages and clades and its ability to invade and establish in an increasing number of countries. Its current distribution, genetic variability, ecology, and epidemiological pattern in the African continent are only partially known despite the general consensus on the urgency to obtain such information for quantifying the actual disease burden in Africa other than to predict future threats at global scale.","660":"Schmidt Science Fellowship in partnership with the Rhodes Trust; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Wellcome Trust.Artemisinin-resistant genotypes of Plasmodium falciparum have now emerged a minimum of six times on three continents despite recommendations that all artemisinins be deployed as artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs). Widespread resistance to the non-artemisinin partner drugs in ACTs has the potential to limit the clinical and resistance benefits provided by combination therapy. We aimed to model and evaluate the long-term effects of high levels of partner-drug resistance on the early emergence of artemisinin-resistant genotypes.Higher frequencies of pre-existing partner-drug resistant genotypes lead to earlier establishment of artemisinin resistance. Across all models, a 10-fold increase in the frequency of partner-drug resistance genotypes on average corresponded to loss of artemisinin efficacy 2-12 years earlier. Most reductions in time to artemisinin resistance establishment were observed after an increase in frequency of the partner-drug resistance genotype from 0\u00b70 to 0\u00b710.Partner-drug resistance in ACTs facilitates the early emergence of artemisinin resistance and is a major public health concern. Higher-grade partner-drug resistance has the largest effect, with piperaquine resistance accelerating the early emergence of artemisinin-resistant alleles the most. Continued investment in molecular surveillance of partner-drug resistant genotypes to guide choice of first-line ACT is paramount.Using a consensus modelling approach, we used three individual-based mathematical models of Plasmodium falciparum transmission to evaluate the effects of pre-existing partner-drug resistance and ACT deployment on the evolution of artemisinin resistance. Each model simulates 100\u2009000 individuals in a particular transmission setting (malaria prevalence of 1%, 5%, 10%, or 20%) with a daily time step that updates individuals' infection status, treatment status, immunity, genotype-specific parasite densities, and clinical state. We modelled varying access to antimalarial drugs if febrile (coverage of 20%, 40%, or 60%) with one primary ACT used as first-line therapy: dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ), artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ), or artemether-lumefantrine (AL). The primary outcome was time until 0\u00b725 580Y allele frequency for artemisinin resistance (the establishment time).","661":"The resurgence of pertussis over the past decades has resulted in incidence levels not witnessed in the United States since the 1950s. The underlying causes have been the subject of much speculation, with particular attention paid to the shortcomings of the latest generation of vaccines. We formulated transmission models comprising competing hypotheses regarding vaccine failure and challenged them to explain 16 years of highly resolved incidence data from Massachusetts, United States. Our results suggest that the resurgence of pertussis is a predictable consequence of incomplete historical coverage with an imperfect vaccine that confers slowly waning immunity. We found evidence that the vaccine itself is effective at reducing overall transmission, yet that routine vaccination alone would be insufficient for elimination of the disease. Our results indicated that the core transmission group is schoolchildren. Therefore, efforts aimed at curtailing transmission in the population at large, and especially in vulnerable infants, are more likely to succeed if targeted at schoolchildren, rather than adults.","662":" (STEC) strains from serogroups O26, O45, O91, O103, O104, O111, O113, O121, O145, and O157.

Using the multiplier method with adjustments improves the detection of influenza disease burden through a matched database. The incidence rates are consistent with national estimates.Over all seasons, 422 influenza cases were reported in the administrative database and 382 influenza cases in the research database. Seventy-five cases (18%) reported in the administrative database were not captured in the research database, and 35 (9%) cases in the research database were not captured in the administrative database. Completeness of the influenza hospitalization was estimated to be 76%. Influenza hospitalizations were higher among unvaccinated (32%) than vaccinated (22%) in the current season and among unvaccinated (28%) than vaccinated (23%) in the previous year. The incidence rates for influenza hospitalizations varied by age and season and averaged 421 cases\/100,000 population annually.Accurate population estimates of disease incidence and burden are needed to set appropriate public health policy. The capture-recapture (C-R) method combines data from multiple sources to better estimate prevalence than is possible using single sources. This study used the C-R method to estimate influenza cases using research and administrative databases to calculate county-wide influenza hospitalization burden.Data were derived from a database of clinical virology test results and research data from an influenza vaccine effectiveness study from seasons 2015-2016 to 2018-2019. Missed influenza cases were estimated using C-R method. These estimates were used to calculate disease burden using the multiplier method to correct for underreporting due to curtailing data collection before the end of influenza circulation.","664":"A number of recent malaria studies have used identity by descent (IBD) to study epidemiological processes relevant to malaria control. In this paper, a software package, hmmIBD, is introduced for estimating pairwise IBD between haploid genomes, such as those of the malaria parasite, sampled from one or two populations. Source code is freely available.Fast and accurate software for detecting IBD in malaria parasite genetic data sampled from one or two populations is presented. The latter will likely be a useful feature for malaria elimination efforts, since it could facilitate identification of imported malaria cases. Software is robust to possible misspecification of the genotyping error and the recombination rate. However, exclusion of data in regions whose rates vary greatly from their genome-wide average is recommended.The performance of hmmIBD was verified using simulated data and benchmarked against an existing method for detecting IBD within populations. Code for all tests is freely available. The utility of hmmIBD for detecting IBD across populations was demonstrated using Plasmodium falciparum data from Cambodia and Ghana.Alongside an existing method, hmmIBD was highly accurate, sensitive and specific. It is fast, requiring only 70\u00a0s on average to analyse 50 whole genome sequences on a laptop computer, and scales linearly in the number of pairwise comparisons. Treatment of different populations under hmmIBD improves detection of IBD across populations.","665":"School reopenings in 2021 and 2022 coincided with the rapid emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United States. In-school mitigation efforts varied, depending on local COVID-19 mandates and resources. Using a stochastic age-stratified agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we estimate the impacts of multiple in-school strategies on both infection rates and absenteeism, relative to a baseline scenario in which only symptomatic cases are tested and positive tests trigger a 10-day isolation of the case and 10-day quarantine of their household and classroom. We find that monthly asymptomatic screening coupled with the 10-day isolation and quarantine period is expected to avert 55.4% of infections while increasing absenteeism by 104.3%. Replacing quarantine with test-to-stay would reduce absenteeism by 66.3% (while hardly impacting infection rates), but would require roughly 10-fold more testing resources. Alternatively, vaccination or mask wearing by 50% of the student body is expected to avert 54.1% or 43.1% of infections while decreasing absenteeism by 34.1% or 27.4%, respectively. Separating students into classrooms based on mask usage is expected to reduce infection risks among those who wear masks (by 23.1%), exacerbate risks among those who do not (by 27.8%), but have little impact on overall risk. A combined strategy of monthly screening, household and classroom quarantine, a 50% vaccination rate, and a 50% masking rate (in mixed classrooms) is expected to avert 81.7% of infections while increasing absenteeism by 90.6%. During future public health emergencies, such analyses can inform the rapid design of resource-constrained strategies that mitigate both public health and educational risks.","666":"As the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa is now contained, attention is turning from control to future outbreak prediction and prevention.

This update demonstrates the potential for incorporating and updating data used to generate the predicted suitability map. A new data portal for sharing such maps is discussed. This output represents the most up-to-date estimate of the extent of EVD zoonotic risk in Africa.

We used human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cerebral organoids expressing tau-V337M and isogenic corrected controls to discover early alterations because of the mutation that precede neurodegeneration. At 2\u00a0months, mutant organoids show upregulated expression of MAPT, glutamatergic signaling pathways, and regulators, including the RNA-binding protein ELAVL4, and increased stress granules. Over the following 4\u00a0months, mutant organoids accumulate splicing changes, disruption of autophagy function, and build-up of tau and P-tau-S396. By 6\u00a0months, tau-V337M organoids show specific loss of glutamatergic neurons as seen in individuals with FTD. Mutant neurons are susceptible to glutamate toxicity, which can be rescued pharmacologically by the PIKFYVE kinase inhibitor apilimod. Our results demonstrate a sequence of events that precede neurodegeneration, revealing molecular pathways associated with glutamate signaling as potential targets for therapeutic intervention in FTD.","668":"A primary use of malaria parasite genomics is identifying highly related infections to quantify epidemiological, spatial, or temporal factors associated with patterns of transmission. For example, spatial clustering of highly related parasites can indicate foci of transmission and temporal differences in relatedness can serve as evidence for changes in transmission over time. However, for infections in settings of moderate to high endemicity, understanding patterns of relatedness is compromised by complex infections, overall high forces of infection, and a highly diverse parasite population. It is not clear how much these factors limit the utility of using genomic data to better understand transmission in these settings. In particular, further investigation is required to determine which patterns of relatedness we expect to see with high quality, densely sampled genomic data in a high transmission setting and how these observations change under different study designs, missingness, and biases in sample collection. Here we investigate two identity-by-state measures of relatedness and apply them to amplicon deep sequencing data collected as part of a longitudinal cohort in Western Kenya that has previously been analysed to identify individual-factors associated with sharing parasites with infected mosquitoes. With these data we use permutation tests, to evaluate several hypotheses about spatiotemporal patterns of relatedness compared to a null distribution. We observe evidence of temporal structure, but not of fine-scale spatial structure in the cohort data. To explore factors associated with the lack of spatial structure in these data, we construct a series of simplified simulation scenarios using an agent based model calibrated to entomological, epidemiological and genomic data from this cohort study to investigate whether the lack of spatial structure observed in the cohort could be due to inherent power limitations of this analytical method. We further investigate how our hypothesis testing behaves under different sampling schemes, levels of completely random and systematic missingness, and different transmission intensities.","669":"During the COVID-19 pandemic there was a plethora of dynamical forecasting models created, but their ability to effectively describe future trajectories of disease was mixed. A major challenge in evaluating future case trends was forecasting the behavior of individuals. When behavior was incorporated into models, it was primarily incorporated exogenously (e.g., fitting to cellphone mobility data). Fewer models incorporated behavior endogenously (e.g., dynamically changing a model parameter throughout the simulation).This review aimed to qualitatively characterize models that included an adaptive (endogenous) behavioral element in the context of COVID-19 transmission. We categorized studies into three approaches: 1) feedback loops, 2) game theory\/utility theory, and 3) information\/opinion spread.While many COVID-19 models incorporated behavior exogenously, these approaches may fail to capture future adaptations in human behavior, resulting in under- or overestimates of disease burden. By incorporating behavior endogenously, the next generation of infectious disease models could more effectively predict outcomes so that decision makers can better prepare for and respond to epidemics.This study was funded in-part by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) MInD-Healthcare Program (1U01CK000536), the National Science Foundation (NSF) Modeling Dynamic Disease-Behavior Feedbacks for Improved Epidemic Prediction and Response grant (2229996), and the NSF PIPP Phase I: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Messaging and Modeling during Pandemics grant (2200256).Of the 92 included studies, 72% employed a feedback loop, 27% used game\/utility theory, and 9% used a model if information\/opinion spread. Among all studies, 89% used a compartmental model alone or in combination with other model types. Similarly, 15% used a network model, 11% used an agent-based model, 7% used a system dynamics model, and 1% used a Markov chain model. Descriptors of behavior change included mask-wearing, social distancing, vaccination, and others. Sixty-eight percent of studies calibrated their model to observed data and 25% compared simulated forecasts to observed data. Forty-one percent of studies compared versions of their model with and without endogenous behavior. Models with endogenous behavior tended to show a smaller and delayed initial peak with subsequent periodic waves.","670":" behavioral, disease, landscape, resource, and wildlife-and facilitate facilitate novel exploration in fields ranging from conservation planning to public health.

Dengue cases do not seem to be associated with precipitation trends and anomalies. The number of days with optimal temperatures for dengue transmission increased from the period without dengue cases to the period with occurrences of dengue cases. The number of months with optimal transmission temperatures also increased between periods but to a lesser extent.The higher incidence of dengue virus and its expansion to different regions of Argentina seem to be associated with temperature increases in the country during the past two decades. The active surveillance of both the vector and associated arboviruses, together with continued meteorological data collection, will facilitate the assessment and prediction of future epidemics that use trends in the accelerated changes in climate. Such surveillance should go hand in hand with efforts to improve the understanding of the mechanisms driving the geographic expansion of dengue and other arboviruses beyond the current limits. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1289\/EHP11616.We analyzed the evolution of climatological, epidemiological, and biological variables by comparing a period of time without the presence of dengue cases (1976-1997) to a more recent period of time in which dengue cases and important outbreaks occurred (1998-2020). In our analysis, we consider climate variables associated with temperature and precipitation, epidemiological variables such as the number of reported dengue cases and incidence of dengue, and biological variables such as the optimal temperature ranges for transmission of dengue vector.Climate change is an important driver of the increased spread of dengue from tropical and subtropical regions to temperate areas around the world. Climate variables such as temperature and precipitation influence the dengue vector's biology, physiology, abundance, and life cycle. Thus, an analysis is needed of changes in climate change and their possible relationships with dengue incidence and the growing occurrence of epidemics recorded in recent decades.","672":"In rural Puerto Rico, the prevalence of current homelessness in IDUs was 21.7%. In the sample, 6.0% were HIV positive and 78.4% were HCV positive. Our results highlight the necessity of increasing accessibility to substance abuse treatment and establishing additional needle-exchange programs (currently, there is only 1) in rural Puerto Rico.This study aimed to determine the association between years of drug injection and homelessness among drug users in rural Puerto Rico.Respondent-driven sampling methods allowed us to obtain a sample of 315 intravenous drug users (IDUs) in rural Puerto Rico. Information about sociodemographic characteristics, drug use patterns, homelessness and risk behaviors was obtained through structured interviews. HIV and HCV statuses were assessed via rapid antibody tests. Frequency distributions were used to describe the study sample. Bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regressions were used to assess covariates of homelessness. The study received IRB approval through the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and the University of Puerto Rico.Almost 91% of the study participants were males. The mean age was 41.7 years and the majority of the participants had not completed high school (47.6%). The prevalence of current homelessness was 21.9%. After controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, homelessness was strongly associated with the number of years of injection drug use. The odds of being homeless for IDUs with 21 years or more of drug injection was almost 3 times higher than were the odds of being homeless for IDUs with fewer than 10 years of injection (OR = 2.58 95%; CI=1.21,5.48).","673":"Cultural processes, as well as the selection pressures experienced by individuals in a population over time and space, are fundamentally stochastic. Phenotypic variability, together with imperfect phenotypic transmission between parents and offspring, has been previously shown to play an important role in evolutionary rescue and (epi)genetic adaptation of populations to fluctuating temporal environmental pressures. This type of evolutionary bet-hedging does not confer a direct benefit to a single individual, but can instead increase the adaptability of the whole lineage. Here we develop a population-genetic model to explore cultural response strategies to temporally changing selection, as well as the role of local population structure, as exemplified by heterogeneity in the contact network between individuals, in shaping evolutionary dynamics. We use this model to study the evolutionary advantage of cultural bet-hedging, modeling the evolution of a variable cultural trait starting from one copy in a population of individuals with a fixed cultural strategy. We find that the probability of fixation of a cultural bet-hedger is a non-monotonic function of the probability of cultural memory between generations. Moreover, this probability increases for networks of higher mean degree but decreases with increasing heterogeneity of the contact network, tilting the balance of forces toward drift and against selection. These results shed light on the interplay of temporal and spatial stochasticity in shaping cultural evolutionary dynamics and suggest that partly-heritable cultural phenotypic variability may constitute an important evolutionary bet-hedging strategy in response to changing selection pressures.","674":"Studies of body size evolution, and life-history theory in general, are conducted without taking into account cancer as a factor that can end an organism's reproductive lifespan. This reflects a tacit assumption that predation, parasitism and starvation are of overriding importance in the wild. We argue here that even if deaths directly attributable to cancer are a rarity in studies of natural populations, it remains incorrect to infer that cancer has not been of importance in shaping observed life histories. We present first steps towards a cancer-aware life-history theory, by quantifying the decrease in the length of the expected reproductively active lifespan that follows from an attempt to grow larger than conspecific competitors. If all else is equal, a larger organism is more likely to develop cancer, but, importantly, many factors are unlikely to be equal. Variations in extrinsic mortality as well as in the pace of life--larger organisms are often near the slow end of the fast-slow life-history continuum--can make realized cancer incidences more equal across species than what would be observed in the absence of adaptive responses to cancer risk (alleviating the so-called Peto's paradox). We also discuss reasons why patterns across species can differ from within-species predictions. Even if natural selection diminishes cancer susceptibility differences between species, within-species differences can remain. In many sexually dimorphic cases, we predict males to be more cancer-prone than females, forming an understudied component of sexual conflict.","675":"Antiretroviral therapy during the earliest stage of acute HIV infection (Fiebig I) might minimize establishment of a latent HIV reservoir and thereby facilitate viremic control after analytical treatment interruption. We show that 8 participants, who initiated treatment during Fiebig I and were treated for a median of 2.8 years, all experienced rapid viral load rebound following analytical treatment interruption, indicating that additional strategies are required to control or eradicate HIV.","676":"Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen of concern for cancer patients, who face higher morbidity and mortality rates than the general population. The neutropenic diet (ND), which excludes fresh produce, is often utilized to mitigate this risk; however, an analysis weighing the theoretical listeriosis risk reduction of produce exclusion aspects of the ND and possible negative tradeoffs has never been conducted. Consequently, this work constructed decision analytic models using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to compare the impacts of the ND, such as increased neutropenic enterocolitis (NEC) likelihood, with three alternative dietary practices (safe food handling [SFH], surface blanching, and refrigeration only) across five age groups, for cancer patients who consume ready-to-eat salad. Less disruptive diets had fewer negative health impacts in all scenarios, with median alternative diet DALYs per person per chemotherapy cycle having lower values in terms of negative health outcomes (0.088-0.443) than the ND (0.619-3.102). DALYs were dominated by outcomes associated with NEC, which is more common in patients following the ND than in other diets. Switchover point analysis confirmed that, because of this discrepancy, there were no feasible values of other parameters that could justify the ND. Correspondingly, the sensitivity analysis indicated that NEC mortality rate and remaining life expectancy strongly affected DALYs, further illustrating the model's strong dependence on NEC outcomes. Given these findings, and the SFH's ease of implementation and high compliance rates, the SFH diet is recommended in place of the ND.","677":" white syndrome, possibly due to a relationship between thermal stress and a compromised host immune system. However, coral density and winter conditions were the most important predictors of all three coral diseases in this study, enabling development of a forecasting system that can predict regions of elevated disease risk up to six months before an expected outbreak. Our research indicates satellite-derived systems for forecasting disease outbreaks can be appropriately adapted from the GBR tools and applied for a variety of diseases in a new region. These models can be used to enhance management capacity to prepare for and respond to emerging coral diseases throughout Hawai'i and can be modified for other diseases and regions around the world.","678":"Vaccine effectiveness and relative change in the odds of acquiring pertussis (odds ratio) in children aged 5 to 9 years, duration of DTaP immunity, and vaccine population-level impact.Vaccination with DTaP according to the US immunization schedule, with a range of assumptions regarding the degree of waning immunity.To assess the duration of immunity and the effectiveness of DTaP vaccines in US children.This study found a marked association between the degree of waning immunity, vaccine effectiveness, and the odds ratio. Counterintuitively, the odds ratio was positively associated with vaccine effectiveness, as a consequence of nonlinear, age-assortative transmission dynamics. Based on the empirical odds ratios (1.33; 95% CI, 1.23-1.43), it was estimated that vaccine effectiveness exceeded 75% in children aged 5 to 9 years and that more than 65% of children remained immune to pertussis 5 years after the last DTaP dose.The United States has experienced a nationwide resurgence of pertussis since the mid-1970s, despite high estimated vaccine coverage. Short-lived immunity induced by diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines in young children is widely believed to be responsible for this growing burden, but the duration of protection conferred by DTaP vaccines remains incompletely quantified.A mathematical, age-structured model of pertussis transmission, previously validated empirically on incidence data in Massachusetts, was used in this simulation study to assess the duration of DTaP immunity most consistent with the empirical values of the relative increase in the odds of acquiring pertussis from recent epidemiologic studies in the United States. The study included 5 simulated cohorts of children born between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2005, followed up between the ages of 5 and 9 years (study period, January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2014). Statistical analysis was performed from May 1 to December 1, 2017.The results of this study suggest that temporal trends in the odds of acquiring pertussis are an unreliable measure of the durability of vaccine-induced protection. They further demonstrate that DTaP vaccines confer imperfect, but long-lived protection. Control strategies should be based on the best available estimates of vaccine properties and the age structure of the transmission network.","679":"To improve efficiency, treatment coverage will need to be increased, particularly in the least efficient contexts where this might require additional spending. However, progress towards global End TB targets is slow even in the most efficient countries. Variables associated with TB spending efficiency suggest efficiency is complimented by commitments to improving health-care access that is free at the point of use and wider progress towards the SDGs. These findings support calls for additional investment in tuberculosis care.We estimated global tuberculosis spending efficiency to be between 73\u00b78% (95% CI 71\u00b72-76\u00b73) and 87\u00b77% (84\u00b79-90\u00b76) in 2019, depending on the analytical method used. This estimate suggests that existing global tuberculosis treatment coverage could be increased by between 12\u00b73% (95% CI 9\u00b74-15\u00b71) and 26\u00b72% (23\u00b77-28\u00b78) for the same amount of spending. Efficiency has improved over the study period, mainly since 2015, but a substantial difference of 70\u00b77-72\u00b71 percentage points between the most and least efficient countries still exists. We found a consistent significant association between efficiency and current health expenditure as a share of gross domestic product, out-of-pocket spending on health, and some Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators such as universal health coverage.In this data envelopment and stochastic frontier analysis, we used data from the WHO Global TB report series on tuberculosis spending as the input and treatment coverage as the output to estimate tuberculosis spending efficiency. We investigated associations between 25 independent variables and overall efficiency.Maximising the efficiency of national tuberculosis programmes is key to improving service coverage, outcomes, and progress towards End TB targets. We aimed to determine the overall efficiency of tuberculosis spending and investigate associated factors in 121 low-income and middle-income countries between 2010 and 2019.None.","680":"Uptake of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) bivalent vaccines and the oral medication nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) has remained low across the United States. Assessing the public health impact of increasing uptake of these interventions in key risk groups can guide further public health resources and policy and determine what proportion of severe COVID-19 is avertable with these interventions.This modeling study used person-level data from the California Department of Public Health on COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and vaccine administration from 23 July 2022 to 23 January 2023. We used a quasi-Poisson regression model calibrated to recent historical data to predict future COVID-19 outcomes and modeled the impact of increasing uptake (up to 70% coverage) of bivalent COVID-19 vaccines and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir during acute illness in different risk groups. Risk groups were defined by age (\u226550, \u226565, \u226575 years) and vaccination status (everyone, primary series only, previously vaccinated). We predicted the number of averted COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths and number needed to treat (NNT).These findings suggest that prioritizing uptake of bivalent boosters and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir among older age groups (\u226565 years) would be most effective (based on NNT) but would not address the entire burden of severe COVID-19.The model predicted that increased uptake of bivalent COVID-19 boosters and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (up to 70% coverage) in all eligible persons could avert an estimated 15.7% (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 11.2%-20.7%; NNT: 17 310) and 23.5% (95% UI, 13.1%-30.0%; NNT: 67) of total COVID-19-related deaths, respectively. In the high-risk group of persons \u226565 years old alone, increased uptake of bivalent boosters and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir could avert an estimated 11.9% (95% UI, 8.4%-15.1%; NNT: 2757) and 22.8% (95% UI, 12.7%-29.2%; NNT: 50) of total COVID-19-related deaths, respectively.","681":"The vehicle trajectory data is a feasible way for us to understand and reveal urban traffic conditions and human mobility. Therefore, it is extremely valuable to have a fine-grained picture of large-scale vehicle trajectory data, particularly in two different modes, taxis and buses, over the same period at an urban scale. This paper integrates the trajectory data of approximately 7,000 taxis and 1,500 buses in Changchun City, China and accesses the temporal geographically-explicit network of public transport via sequential snapshots of vehicle trajectory data every 30\u2009seconds of the first week in March 2018. In order to reveal urban traffic conditions and human mobility, we construct two-layer urban traffic network (UTN) between these two different transport modes, take crossings as nodes and roads as edges weighted by the volume or average speed of vehicles in each hour. We released this temporal geographically-explicit network of public transport and the dynamics, weighted and directed UTN in simple formats for easy access.","682":"Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are the main cause of death worldwide. In addition, the incidence, prevalence, and death rates from NCDs are expected to increase in the future. No single discipline can address the issues of prevention, early detection, access to care, and appropriate treatment that are needed to improve outcomes for NCDs; this growing need will require transdisciplinary collaborations. Improving outcomes in NCDs is clearly a difficult endeavor that will require significant efforts. However, previous research and program implementation indicates that improving outcomes for NCDs is an achievable goal. Given the tremendous impact of NCDs on morbidity, mortality, and costs worldwide, there is little doubt that efforts to improve NDC outcomes are much needed. Recognizing the importance of new strategies and interventions addressing NCDS globally, RTI funded the projects described here to assess how the institute\u0092s range of expertise could be focused on the reduction of NCDs. The projects described in this book focus on the risk factors or treatment (or both) of one or more of the four NCDs that are responsible for the greatest impact on morbidity and mortality: cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases. The pilot projects were carried out in low- and middle-income countries, which are disproportionately affected by NCDs. The lessons learned from these initial pilot projects have great potential to be increased in their scale and reduce the devastating impact of noncommunicable diseases.","683":"SARS-CoV-2 evolution threatens vaccine- and natural infection-derived immunity as well as the efficacy of therapeutic antibodies. To improve public health preparedness, we sought to predict which existing amino acid mutations in SARS-CoV-2 might contribute to future variants of concern. We tested the predictive value of features comprising epidemiology, evolution, immunology, and neural network-based protein sequence modeling, and identified primary biological drivers of SARS-CoV-2 intra-pandemic evolution. We found evidence that ACE2-mediated transmissibility and resistance to population-level host immunity has waxed and waned as a primary driver of SARS-CoV-2 evolution over time. We retroactively identified with high accuracy (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, AUROC=0.92-0.97) mutations that will spread, at up to four months in advance, across different phases of the pandemic. The behavior of the model was consistent with a plausible causal structure wherein epidemiological covariates combine the effects of diverse and shifting drivers of viral fitness. We applied our model to forecast mutations that will spread in the future and characterize how these mutations affect the binding of therapeutic antibodies. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to forecast the driver mutations that could appear in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. We validate this result against Omicron, showing elevated predictive scores for its component mutations prior to emergence, and rapid score increase across daily forecasts during emergence. This modeling approach may be applied to any rapidly evolving pathogens with sufficiently dense genomic surveillance data, such as influenza, and unknown future pandemic viruses.","684":"Animal space use and spatial overlap can have important consequences for population-level processes such as social interactions and pathogen transmission. Identifying how environmental variability and inter-individual variation affect spatial patterns and in turn influence interactions in animal populations is a priority for the study of animal behaviour and disease ecology. Environmental food availability and macroparasite infection are common drivers of variation, but there are few experimental studies investigating how they affect spatial patterns of wildlife. Bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) are a tractable study system to investigate spatial patterns of wildlife and are amenable to experimental manipulations. We conducted a replicated, factorial field experiment in which we provided supplementary food and removed helminths in vole populations in natural forest habitat and monitored vole space use and spatial overlap using capture-mark-recapture methods. Using network analysis, we quantified vole space use and spatial overlap. We compared the effects of food supplementation and helminth removal and investigated the impacts of season, sex and reproductive status on space use and spatial overlap. We found that food supplementation decreased vole space use while helminth removal increased space use. Space use also varied by sex, reproductive status and season. Spatial overlap was similar between treatments despite up to threefold differences in population size. By quantifying the spatial effects of food availability and macroparasite infection on wildlife populations, we demonstrate the potential for space use and population density to trade-off and maintain consistent spatial overlap in wildlife populations. This has important implications for spatial processes in wildlife including pathogen transmission.","685":"Suicide rates have increased in the U.S. over the past 15 years with substantial geographic variation in these increases; yet there have been few attempts to cluster counties by the magnitude of suicide rate changes by intercept and slope or to identify the economic precursors of increases. We used Vital Statistics data and growth mixture models to identify clusters of counties by their magnitude of suicide growth from 2008 to 2020 and examined associations with county economic and labor indices. Our models identified five clusters, each differentiated by intercept and slope magnitude, with the highest rate cluster (4% of counties) mainly in sparsely populated areas in the West and Alaska, starting the time series at 25.4 suicides\/100,000, and exhibiting the steepest increase in slope (0.69\/100,000 per year). There was no cluster for which the suicide rate was stable or declining. Counties in the highest rate cluster were more likely to have agriculture and service economies, and less likely to have urban professional economies. Given the increased burden of suicide, with no clusters of counties improving over time, additional policy and prevention efforts are needed, particularly targeted at rural areas in the West.","686":"BackgroundThe natural history of disease in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remained obscure during the early pandemic.AimOur objective was to estimate epidemiological parameters of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and assess the relative infectivity of the incubation period.MethodsWe estimated the distributions of four epidemiological parameters of SARS-CoV-2 transmission using a large database of COVID-19 cases and potential transmission pairs of cases, and assessed their heterogeneity by demographics, epidemic phase and geographical region. We further calculated the time of peak infectivity and quantified the proportion of secondary infections during the incubation period.ResultsThe median incubation period was 7.2 (95% confidence interval (CI): 6.9\u20127.5) days. The median serial and generation intervals were similar, 4.7 (95% CI: 4.2\u20125.3) and 4.6 (95% CI: 4.2\u20125.1) days, respectively. Paediatric cases\u2009<\u200918 years had a longer incubation period than adult age groups (p\u2009=\u20090.007). The median incubation period increased from 4.4 days before 25 January to 11.5 days after 31 January (p\u2009<\u20090.001), whereas the median serial (generation) interval contracted from 5.9 (4.8) days before 25 January to 3.4 (3.7) days after. The median time from symptom onset to discharge was also shortened from 18.3 before 22 January to 14.1 days after. Peak infectivity occurred 1 day before symptom onset on average, and the incubation period accounted for 70% of transmission.ConclusionThe high infectivity during the incubation period led to short generation and serial intervals, necessitating aggressive control measures such as early case finding and quarantine of close contacts.","687":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389\/fvets.2021.685877.].","688":"Widespread use of at-home COVID-19 tests hampers determination of community COVID-19 incidence. Using nationwide data available through the US National Wastewater Surveillance System, we examined the performance of two wastewater metrics in predicting high case and hospitalizations rates both before and after widespread use of at-home tests.Among 268 counties across 22 states, wastewater percentile detected high reported case and hospitalizations rates in the first quarter of 2022 (AUC 0.95 and 0.86 respectively) whereas the percent change did not (AUC 0.54 and 0.49 respectively). A wastewater percentile of 51% maximized sensitivity (0.93) and specificity (0.82) for detecting high case rates. A model inclusive of both metrics performed no better than using wastewater percentile alone. The predictive capability of wastewater percentile declined over time (AUC 0.84 and 0.72 for cases for second and third quarters of 2022).Nationwide, county wastewater levels above 51% relative to the historic peak predicted high COVID rates and hospitalization in the first quarter of 2022, but performed less well in subsequent quarters. Decline over time in predictive performance of this metric likely reflects underreporting of cases, reduced testing, and possibly lower virulence of infection due to vaccines and treatments.We performed area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (AUC) for two wastewater metrics-viral concentration relative to the peak of January 2022 (\"wastewater percentile\") and 15-day percent change in SARS-CoV-2 (\"percent change\"). Dichotomized reported cases (\u2265 200 or <200 cases per 100,000) and new hospitalizations (\u2265 10 or <10 per 100,000) were our dependent variables, stratified by calendar quarter. Using logistic regression, we assessed the performance of combining wastewater metrics.","689":" (MRSA) is a continued threat to human health in both community and healthcare settings. In hospitals, control efforts would benefit from accurate estimation of asymptomatic colonization and infection importation rates from the community. However, developing such estimates remains challenging due to limited observation of colonization and complicated transmission dynamics within hospitals and the community. Here, we develop an inference framework that can estimate these key quantities by combining statistical filtering techniques, an agent-based model, and real-world patient-to-patient contact networks, and use this framework to infer nosocomial transmission and infection importation over an outbreak spanning 6 years in 66 Swedish hospitals. In particular, we identify a small number of patients with disproportionately high risk of colonization. In retrospective control experiments, interventions targeted to these individuals yield a substantial improvement over heuristic strategies informed by number of contacts, length of stay and contact tracing.","690":"Results from the analysis reveal that if Ae. aegypti is the only competent Zika vector, then risk is geographically limited; in North America mainly to Florida and Texas. However, if Ae. albopictus proves to be a competent vector of Zika, which does not yet appear to be the case, then there is risk of local establishment in all American regions including Canada and Chile, much of Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, as well as South and East Asia, with a substantial increase in risk to Asia due to the more recent local establishment of Zika in Singapore.The 2015-16 Zika virus pandemic originating in Latin America led to predictions of a catastrophic global spread of the disease. Since the current outbreak began in Brazil in May 2015 local transmission of Zika has been reported in over 60 countries and territories, with over 750 thousand confirmed and suspected cases. As a result of its range expansion attention has focused on possible modes of transmission, of which the arthropod vector-based disease spread cycle involving Aedes species is believed to be the most important. Additional causes of concern are the emerging new links between Zika disease and Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), and a once rare congenital disease, microcephaly.Like dengue and chikungunya, the geographic establishment of Zika is thought to be limited by the occurrence of its principal vector mosquito species, Ae. aegypti and, possibly, Ae. albopictus. While Ae. albopictus populations are more widely established than those of Ae. aegypti, the relative competence of these species as a Zika vector is unknown. The analysis reported here presents a global risk model that considers the role of each vector species independently, and quantifies the potential spreading risk of Zika into new regions. Six scenarios are evaluated which vary in the weight assigned to Ae. albopictus as a possible spreading vector. The scenarios are bounded by the extreme assumptions that spread is driven by air travel and Ae. aegypti presence alone and spread driven equally by both species. For each scenario destination cities at highest risk of Zika outbreaks are prioritized, as are source cities in affected regions. Finally, intercontinental air travel routes that pose the highest risk for Zika spread are also ranked. The results are compared between scenarios.","691":"Mathematical modelling has been used extensively to estimate the potential impact of new tuberculosis vaccines, with the majority of existing models assuming that individuals with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection remain at lifelong risk of tuberculosis disease. Recent research provides evidence that self-clearance of Mtb infection may be common, which may affect the potential impact of new vaccines that only take in infected or uninfected individuals. We explored how the inclusion of self-clearance in models of tuberculosis affects the estimates of vaccine impact in China and India.Our work suggests that the neglect of self-clearance in mathematical models of tuberculosis vaccines does not result in substantially biased estimates of tuberculosis vaccine impact. It may, however, mean that we are slightly underestimating the relative advantages of vaccines that work in uninfected individuals only compared to those that work in infected individuals.For both countries, we calibrated a tuberculosis model to a scenario without self-clearance and to various scenarios with self-clearance. To account for the current uncertainty in self-clearance properties, we varied the rate of self-clearance, and the level of protection against reinfection in self-cleared individuals. We introduced potential new vaccines in 2025, exploring vaccines that work in uninfected or infected individuals only, or that are effective regardless of infection status, and modelling scenarios with different levels of vaccine efficacy in self-cleared individuals. We then estimated the relative incidence reduction in 2050 for each vaccine compared to the no vaccination scenario.The inclusion of self-clearance increased the estimated relative reductions in incidence in 2050 for vaccines effective only in uninfected individuals, by a maximum of 12% in China and 8% in India. The inclusion of self-clearance increased the estimated impact of vaccines only effective in infected individuals in some scenarios and decreased it in others, by a maximum of 14% in China and 15% in India. As would be expected, the inclusion of self-clearance had minimal impact on estimated reductions in incidence for vaccines that work regardless of infection status.","692":"Annual influenza vaccination is a key to preventing widespread influenza infections. Recent reports of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) indicate that vaccination in prior years may reduce VE in the current season, suggesting vaccine interference. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential effect of repeat influenza vaccinations in the presence of vaccine interference.Even in the presence of potential vaccine interference, our work provides a population-level perspective on the potential merits of repeated influenza vaccination. This is because repeat vaccination groups had lower attack rates than groups that omitted the second vaccination unless vaccine interference was at very high, perhaps implausible, levels.The model shows that, even in the presence of vaccine interference, revaccination reduces the influenza attack rate and provides individual benefits. Specifically, annual vaccination is a favored strategy over vaccination in alternate years, as long as the level of residual protection is less than 58% or vaccine interference effect is minimal. Furthermore, the negative impact of vaccine interference may be offset by increased vaccine coverage levels.Using literature-based parameters, an age-structured influenza equation-based transmission model was used to determine the optimal vaccination strategy, while considering the effect of varying levels of interference.","693":"Disease ecology is a rapidly growing subdiscipline, and mammals and their parasites feature prominently in both historical and more recent research efforts. Nevertheless, the diversity of topics explored, and those not well explored, has not been systematically assessed. We conducted a systematic review of the published scientific literature in disease ecology of mammals and subjected the collection of original and review articles identified to a topic modeling approach, which is based on the words used in the published texts and their contexts (i.e., the frequency and strength of their semantic relationships with one another). In addition to concept maps identifying the most prominent research themes, we identified eight (not mutually exclusive) subcategories of studies, including experimental, theoretical, comparative, behavioral, immunological-microbiological, biogeographic-macroecological, vector-focused (e.g., mosquitoes), and disturbance-focused. The most prominent themes arising in review papers included the ecology of zoonotic diseases transmitted from non-human mammals, comparisons of pathogen prevalence between mammalian species, and pathogen discovery-disease surveillance studies, particularly of marine mammals and bats. For the original articles, the most prominent themes included ecology of rodent-transmitted viral and bacterial diseases and the population biology of zoonotic hosts. Most studies used comparative or descriptive approaches to investigate mammal-pathogen-disease relationships at a local scale, focusing on vector-borne diseases. Experimental, modeling, immunological, and behavioral approaches were strikingly underrepresented. Topics of strong conceptual importance, but that are underrepresented in the current literature, include: 1) the effects of the population density of mammalian hosts, and manipulations of density, on pathogen transmission; 2) macroecological studies that quantify effects of mammalian host species on parasite abundance and prevalence; and 3) effects of climate change on physiological and behavioral processes relevant to mammal-parasite interactions.","694":". Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of group testing designs for individual identification or prevalence estimation of SARS-CoV-2 infection when testing capacity is limited. To do this, we developed mathematical models for epidemic spread, incorporating empirically measured individual-level viral kinetics to simulate changing viral loads in a large population over the course of an epidemic. We used these to construct representative populations and assess pooling strategies for community screening, accounting for variability in viral load samples, dilution effects, changing prevalence and resource constraints. We confirmed our group testing framework through pooled tests on de-identified human nasopharyngeal specimens with viral loads representative of the larger population. We show that group testing designs can both accurately estimate overall prevalence using a small number of measurements and substantially increase the identification rate of infected individuals in resource-limited settings.","695":"Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila) is an infectious disease agent of increasing concern due to its ability to cause Legionnaires\u0092 Disease, a severe community pneumonia, and the difficulty in controlling it within water systems. L. pneumophila thrives within the biofilm of premise plumbing systems, utilizing protozoan hosts for protection from disinfectants and other environmental stressors. While there is a great deal of information regarding how L. pneumophila interacts with protozoa and human macrophages (host for human infection), the ability to use this data in a model to attempt to predict a concentration of L. pneumophila in a water system is not known. The lifecycle of L. pneumophila within host cells involves three processes: uptake, growth, and egression from the host cell. The complexity of these three processes would risk conflation of the concepts; therefore, this review details the available information regarding how L. pneumophila invades host cells (uptake) within the context of data needed to model this process, while a second review will focus on growth and egression. The overall intent of both reviews is to detail how the steps in L. pneumophila\u0092s lifecycle in drinking water systems affect human infectivity, as opposed to detailing just its growth and persistence in drinking water systems","696":"To describe the incidence and epidemiological characteristics of child pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) notified to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Tuberculosis Information Management System (TBIMS) from 2009 to 2015.The notified incidence of child PTB in mainland China decreased substantially over 7 years. Future prevention and control of PTB in children should focus on the 0-1 and 12-14 years of age groups, and Tibet and Guizhou provinces. However, the notified incidence is still low, relative to adults, suggesting substantial under-reporting. Thus, more effective care seeking, identification and registration of children with TB are crucial.In total, 35,710 child PTB cases were notified to the TBIMS, representing only 0.60% of all 5,991,593 PTB case notifications. The average annual notified incidence of child PTB was 2.44\/ per 100,000 children (95% CI: 1.77-3.10) and decreased by 52.53% in all age groups during the study period. Tibet had the highest incidence (15.95\/ per 100,000 children), followed by Guizhou and Xinjiang. However, the case numbers were the most in Guizhou. The 0-1 year and 12-14 years of age groups exhibited the most cases. The positive rates of sputum smears, bacteriology and chest X-rays abnormality were 21.5%, 21.7% and 98.1%, respectively, which were lower than those 15 years of age and older (all p-values<0.0001).A database of child PTB for 31 provinces in mainland China over 7 years was retrospectively analysed. The spatiotemporal distribution of child PTB was described.","697":"The response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S prompted abrupt and dramatic changes to social contact patterns. Monitoring changing social behavior is essential to provide reliable input data for mechanistic models of infectious disease, which have been increasingly used to support public health policy to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic. While some studies have reported on changing contact patterns throughout the pandemic, few have reported differences in contact patterns among key demographic groups and none have reported nationally representative estimates. We conducted a national probability survey of US households and collected information on social contact patterns during two time periods: August-December 2020 (before widespread vaccine availability) and March-April 2021 (during national vaccine rollout). Overall, contact rates in Spring 2021 were similar to those in Fall 2020, with most contacts reported at work. Persons identifying as non-White, non-Black, non-Asian, and non-Hispanic reported high numbers of contacts relative to other racial and ethnic groups. Contact rates were highest in those reporting occupations in retail, hospitality and food service, and transportation. Those testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies reported a higher number of daily contacts than those who were seronegative. Our findings provide evidence for differences in social behavior among demographic groups, highlighting the profound disparities that have become the hallmark of the COVID-19 pandemic.","698":"Present estimates suggest there are over 1 million virus species found in mammals alone, with about half a million posing a possible threat to human health. Although previous estimates assume linear scaling between host and virus diversity, we show that ecological network theory predicts a non-linear relationship, produced by patterns of host sharing among virus species. To account for host sharing, we fit a power law scaling relationship for host-virus species interaction networks. We estimate that there are about 40,000 virus species in mammals (including ~10,000 viruses with zoonotic potential), a reduction of two orders of magnitude from present projections of viral diversity. We expect that the increasing availability of host-virus association data will improve the precision of these estimates and their use in the sampling and surveillance of pathogens with pandemic potential. We suggest host sharing should be more widely included in macroecological approaches to estimating biodiversity.","699":"An estimated 480,150 (95% CI: 260,072-582,516) hospitalizations, 132,156 (50,409-157,767) ICU admissions and 125,376 (53,792-152,037) deaths were directly averted by vaccination in people aged\u2009\u2265\u200950\u00a0years, which corresponds to a reduction of 63.2% (48.2-67.6), 68.7% (45.6-72.4) and 62.7% (41.9-67.1) respectively, compared to what would have been expected without vaccination over the study period. An estimated 5852 (2285-6853) deaths were directly averted among the 50-59\u00a0years old, 16,837 (6568-19,473) among the 60-69\u00a0years old, 32,136 (13,651-36,758) among the 70-79\u00a0years old and 70,551 (31,288-88,953) among the\u2009\u2265\u200980\u00a0years old.The vaccination campaign in France considerably reduced COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, as well as stress on the healthcare system.Given the widespread implementation of COVID-19 vaccination to mitigate the pandemic from the end of 2020, it is important to retrospectively evaluate its impact, in particular by quantifying the number of severe outcomes prevented through vaccination.We estimated the number of hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths directly averted by vaccination in France, in people aged\u2009\u2265\u200950\u00a0years, from December 2020 to March 2022, based on (1) the number of observed events, (2) vaccination coverage, and (3) vaccine effectiveness. We accounted for the effect of primary vaccination and the first booster dose, the circulating variants, the age groups, and the waning of vaccine-induced protection over time.","700":"Consumption and composition of tetracyclines, sulphonamides and trimethoprim, and other antibacterials showed wide variations between EU\/EEA countries and over time. This represents an opportunity to further reduce consumption of these groups in some countries and improve the quality of their prescription.For the period 1997-2017, data on consumption of tetracyclines (ATC group J01A), sulphonamides and trimethoprim (ATC group J01E), and other antibacterials (ATC group J01X) in the community and aggregated at the level of the active substance, were collected using the WHO ATC\/DDD methodology (ATC\/DDD index 2019). Consumption was expressed in DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day and in packages per 1000 inhabitants per day. Consumption of tetracyclines, sulphonamides and trimethoprim, and other antibacterials was analysed based on ATC-4 subgroups and presented as trends, seasonal variation, presence of change-points and compositional changes.In 2017, consumption of tetracyclines, sulphonamides and trimethoprim, and other antibacterials in the community expressed in DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day varied considerably between countries. Between 1997 and 2017, consumption of tetracyclines did not change significantly, while its seasonal variation significantly decreased over time. Consumption of sulphonamides and trimethoprim significantly decreased until 2006, and its seasonal variation significantly decreased over time. The consumption of other antibacterials showed no significant change over time or in seasonal variation.Data on consumption of tetracyclines, sulphonamides and trimethoprim, and other antibacterials were collected from 30 EU\/European Economic Area (EEA) countries over two decades. This article reviews temporal trends, seasonal variation, presence of change-points and changes in the composition of main subgroups of tetracyclines, sulphonamides and trimethoprim and other antibacterials.","701":"Our results revealed an increase in the genetic diversity of human norovirus GII.2 during the recent Asian outbreak and diversification was characterized by at least eight distinct clusters. Bayesian estimation of viral population dynamics revealed a highly fluctuating effective population size, increasing in frequency during the past 15 years.The human norovirus GII.2 outbreak during the 2016-2017 winter season was of unprecedented scale and geographic distribution. gene sequences of the human norovirus GII.2 genotype sampled during the 2016-2017 winter season, as well as prior (dating back to 1976) from 7 countries. Phylodynamic analyses of these sequences were performed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistical frameworks in order to estimate viral evolutionary and population dynamics associated with the outbreak.Despite an increasing viral diversity, we found no evidence of an elevated evolutionary rate or significant selection pressure in human norovirus GII.2, indicating viral evolutionary adaptation was not responsible for the volatility of or spread of the virus during this time.","702":"During the 2020-2021 academic year, schools across the country were closed for prolonged periods. Prior research suggests that children tend to gain more weight during times of extended school closures, such as summer vacation; however, little is known about the impact of school learning mode on changes. Thus, the aim of this study was to measure the association between school mode (in-person, hybrid, remote) and pediatric body mass index (BMI) percentile increases over time. In this longitudinal, statewide retrospective cohort study in Massachusetts, we found that BMI percentile increased in elementary and middle school students in all learning modes, and that increases slowed but did not reverse following the statewide reopening. Body mass percentile increases were highest in elementary school aged children. Hispanic ethnicity and receipt of Medicaid insurance were also associated with increases. Additional research is needed to identify strategies to combat pediatric body mass percentile increases and to address disparities.","703":"Models suggest that the probability of achieving zero transmission of Vibrio cholerae in Haiti with current methods of control is low, and that bolder action is needed to promote elimination of cholera from the region. Large-scale cholera vaccination campaigns in Haiti would offer the opportunity to synchronise nationwide immunity, providing near-term population protection while improvements to water and sanitation promote long-term cholera elimination.Cholera was introduced into Haiti in 2010. Since then, more than 820\u2008000 cases and nearly 10\u2008000 deaths have been reported. Oral cholera vaccine (OCV) is safe and effective, but has not been seen as a primary tool for cholera elimination due to a limited period of protection and constrained supplies. Regionally, epidemic cholera is contained to the island of Hispaniola, and the lowest numbers of cases since the epidemic began were reported in 2019. Hence, Haiti may represent a unique opportunity to eliminate cholera with OCV.In this modelling study, we assessed the probability of elimination, time to elimination, and percentage of cases averted with OCV campaign scenarios in Haiti through simulations from four modelling teams. For a 10-year period from January 19, 2019, to Jan 13, 2029, we compared a no vaccination scenario with five OCV campaign scenarios that differed in geographical scope, coverage, and rollout duration. Teams used weekly department-level reports of suspected cholera cases from the Haiti Ministry of Public Health and Population to calibrate the models and used common vaccine-related assumptions, but other model features were determined independently.Among campaigns with the same vaccination coverage (70% fully vaccinated), the median probability of elimination after 5 years was 0-18% for no vaccination, 0-33% for 2-year campaigns focused in the two departments with the highest historical incidence, 0-72% for three-department campaigns, and 35-100% for nationwide campaigns. Two-department campaigns averted a median of 12-58% of infections, three-department campaigns averted 29-80% of infections, and national campaigns averted 58-95% of infections. Extending the national campaign to a 5-year rollout (compared to a 2-year rollout), reduced the probability of elimination to 0-95% and the proportion of cases averted to 37-86%.Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Global Good Fund, Institute for Disease Modeling, Swiss National Science Foundation, and US National Institutes of Health.","704":"Over the 15-year horizon, per-patient cost of treatment with a non-rechargeable device was $64,111 versus $36,990 with a rechargeable device, resulting in estimated payer cost savings of $27,121. These cost savings were found to be robust across a wide range of scenarios. Longer analysis horizon, younger patient age, and longer rechargeable neurostimulator lifetime were associated with increased cost savings. Over a 15-year horizon, adoption of a rechargeable device strategy was projected to save the United States healthcare system up to $12 billion.Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) is a guideline-recommended third-line treatment option for managing overactive bladder. Current SNM devices are not rechargeable, and require neurostimulator replacement every 3-6 years. Our study objective was to assess potential cost effects to payers of adopting a rechargeable SNM neurostimulator device.We constructed a cost-consequence model to estimate the costs of long-term SNM-treatment with a rechargeable versus non-rechargeable device. Costs were considered from the payer perspective at 2015 reimbursement levels. Adverse events, therapy discontinuation, and programming rates were based on the latest published data. Neurostimulator longevity was assumed to be 4.4 and 10.0 years for non-rechargeable and rechargeable devices, respectively. A 15-year horizon was modeled, with costs discounted at 3% per year. Total budget impact to the United States healthcare system was estimated based on the computed per-patient cost findings.At current reimbursement rates, our analysis suggests that rechargeable neurostimulator SNM technology for managing overactive bladder syndrome may deliver significant cost savings to payers over the course of treatment.

Periconceptional folic acid supplementation and food fortification are recommended to prevent neural tube defects. Mechanisms whereby periconceptional folate influences normal development and disease are poorly understood: epigenetics may be involved. We examine the association between maternal plasma folate during pregnancy and epigenome-wide DNA methylation using Illumina's HumanMethyl450 Beadchip in 1,988 newborns from two European cohorts. Here we report the combined covariate-adjusted results using meta-analysis and employ pathway and gene expression analyses. Four-hundred forty-three CpGs (320 genes) are significantly associated with maternal plasma folate levels during pregnancy (false discovery rate 5%); 48 are significant after Bonferroni correction. Most genes are not known for folate biology, including APC2, GRM8, SLC16A12, OPCML, PRPH, LHX1, KLK4 and PRSS21. Some relate to birth defects other than neural tube defects, neurological functions or varied aspects of embryonic development. These findings may inform how maternal folate impacts the developing epigenome and health outcomes in offspring. ","706":"We carried out longitudinal sampling and analysis among 214 individuals enrolled at multiple New York City locations from fall 2016 to spring 2018. We combined personal information with weekly nasal swab collection to investigate the prevalence of 18 respiratory viruses among different age groups and to assess risk factors associated with infection susceptibility.Respiratory viral infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, their characterization is incomplete because prevalence estimates are based on syndromic surveillance data. Here, we address this shortcoming through the analysis of infection rates among individuals tested regularly for respiratory viral infections, irrespective of their symptoms.Respiratory viral infections are widespread among the general population with the majority of individuals presenting multiple infections per year. The observations identify children as the principal source of respiratory infections. These findings motivate further active surveillance and analysis of differences in pathogenicity among respiratory viruses.17.5% of samples were positive for respiratory viruses. Some viruses circulated predominantly during winter, whereas others were found year round. Rhinovirus and coronavirus were most frequently detected. Children registered the highest positivity rates, and adults with daily contacts with children experienced significantly more infections than their counterparts without children.","707":"Two zoonotic influenza A viruses (IAV) of global concern, H5N1 and H7N9, exhibit unexplained differences in age distribution of human cases. Using data from all known human cases of these viruses, we show that an individual's first IAV infection confers lifelong protection against severe disease from novel hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes in the same phylogenetic group. Statistical modeling shows that protective HA imprinting is the crucial explanatory factor, and it provides 75% protection against severe infection and 80% protection against death for both H5N1 and H7N9. Our results enable us to predict age distributions of severe disease for future pandemics and demonstrate that a novel strain's pandemic potential increases yearly when a group-mismatched HA subtype dominates seasonal influenza circulation. These findings open new frontiers for rational pandemic risk assessment.","708":"Online social media information is often used as a proxy for unavailable or partially observed data on networks of offline contacts. This, in turn, requires an understanding of how close the proxy online structure is to the \"true\" offline social network. Social media tools such as Meetup that collect information about both online networks and their offline counterparts are of particularly importance as they shed more light on the (dis)similarity of online and offline contacts and highlight its potential causes. In this paper we examine structural (dis)similarities of the Meetup online and offline data, with a particular focus on geographical differences. We introduce a new measure called the event score to assess connections made by the most socially active individuals, or social butterflies. We apply the new social activity metric to determine which sorts of events are attended most by social butterflies and to evaluate how this aspect of the network structure differs across US cities.","709":"Following outbreak containment, rigorous control measures allowed the outbreak to be declared over quickly. This highlights the need for effective interventions, not only to reduce cases during outbreaks but also to allow outbreaks to be declared over with confidence.A hospital-related cluster of 22 COVID-19 cases occurred in Taiwan in January-February 2021. Rigorous control measures were introduced and could only be relaxed once the outbreak was declared over. Each day after the apparent outbreak end, we estimated the risk of future cases occurring, to inform decision-making.Probabilistic transmission networks were reconstructed and transmission parameters (the reproduction number R and overdispersion parameter k) were estimated. We estimated the reporting delay during the outbreak (Scenario 1). We also considered a counterfactual scenario with less effective interventions characterized by a longer reporting delay (Scenario 2). Each day, we estimated the risk of future cases under both scenarios.The values of R and k were estimated to be 1.30 (95% credible interval: 0.57,3.80) and 0.38 (0.12,1.20), respectively. The mean reporting delays considered were 2.5 days (Scenario 1) and 7.8 days (Scenario 2). The inferred probability of future cases occurring declined more quickly in Scenario 1 than Scenario 2.","710":"Many human infectious diseases originate from animals or are transmitted through animal vectors. We aimed to identify factors that are predictive of ownership and touching of animals, assess whether animal ownership influences social contact behavior, and estimate the probability of a major zoonotic outbreak should a transmissible influenza-like pathogen be present in animals, all in the setting of a densely populated European country. A diary-based social contact survey (n = 1768) was conducted in Flanders, Belgium, from September 2010 until February 2011. Many participants touched pets (46%), poultry (2%) or livestock (2%) on a randomly assigned day, and a large proportion of participants owned such animals (51%, 15% and 5%, respectively). Logistic regression models indicated that larger households are more likely to own an animal and, unsurprisingly, that animal owners are more likely to touch animals. We observed a significant effect of age on animal ownership and touching. The total number of social contacts during a randomly assigned day was modeled using weighted-negative binomial regression. Apart from age, household size and day type (weekend versus weekday and regular versus holiday period), animal ownership was positively associated with the total number of social contacts during the weekend. Assuming that animal ownership and\/or touching are at-risk events, we demonstrate a method to estimate the outbreak potential of zoonoses. We show that in Belgium animal-human interactions involving young children (0-9 years) and adults (25-54 years) have the highest potential to cause a major zoonotic outbreak. ","711":"The One Health initiative is a global effort fostering interdisciplinary collaborations to address challenges in human, animal, and environmental health. While One Health has received considerable press, its benefits remain unclear because its effects have not been quantitatively described. We systematically surveyed the published literature and used social network analysis to measure interdisciplinarity in One Health studies constructing dynamic pathogen transmission models. The number of publications fulfilling our search criteria increased by 14.6% per year, which is faster than growth rates for life sciences as a whole and for most biology subdisciplines. Surveyed publications clustered into three communities: one used by ecologists, one used by veterinarians, and a third diverse-authorship community used by population biologists, mathematicians, epidemiologists, and experts in human health. Overlap between these communities increased through time in terms of author number, diversity of co-author affiliations, and diversity of citations. However, communities continue to differ in the systems studied, questions asked, and methods employed. While the infectious disease research community has made significant progress toward integrating its participating disciplines, some segregation--especially along the veterinary\/ecological research interface--remains.","712":"Change in physician compensation was not a key driver of care delivery in family medicine clinics. Understanding changes in care delivery may require looking at a broad array of system, physician, and patient factors.Many highly capitated systems still pay physicians based on relative value units (RVU), which may lead to excessive office visits. We reviewed electronic health records from the family medicine clinic panel members of 97 physicians and 42 residents to determine if a change from RVUs to panel-based compensation influenced care delivery as defined by the number of office visits and telephone contacts per panel member per month.A retrospective analysis of the electronic health records of patients seen in 4 residency training clinics, 10 community clinics, and 4 regional clinics was conducted. We assessed face-to-face care delivery and telephone call volume for the clinics individually and for the clinics pooled by clinic type from 1 year before to at least 1 year after the change.Change in physician compensation was not found to have an effect on office visits or telephone calls per panel member per month when pooled by clinic categories. Some significant effects were seen in individual clinics without any clear patterns by clinic size or type.","713":"It is alarming that nearly 1 in 3 MOUD prescriptions go unfilled. More research is needed to understand and reduce barriers to this final step of the OUD cascade of care.We identified 264 individuals with a new diagnosis of OUD who had a prescription written for buprenorphine or oral naltrexone. Of these, 70% (184) filled the prescription within 30\u00a0days, and more than half (57%) filled the prescription on the day it was written. Individuals with prescription copay at or below the mean had a 75% fill rate at 30\u00a0days compared with 63% for those with copay above the mean (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and this difference was consistent across fill times (log rank p-value <0.05).Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are highly effective, but barriers along the cascade of care for opioid use disorder (OUD) from diagnosis to treatment limit their reach. For individuals desiring MOUD, the final step in the cascade is filling a written prescription, and fill rates have not been described.We used data from a large de-identified database linking individuals' electronic medical records (EMR) and administrative claims data and employed a previously developed algorithm to identify individuals with a new diagnosis of OUD. We included individuals with a prescription for buprenorphine or naltrexone recorded in the EMR. The outcome was a prescription fill within 30\u00a0days as reported in claims data. We compared demographic and clinical characteristics between those who did and did not fill the prescription and used a Kaplan-Meier curve to assess whether fill rates differed based on patient copay.","714":"Monitoring trachoma transmission with antibody data requires characterization of decay in IgG to Chlamydia trachomatis antigens. In a three-year longitudinal cohort in a high transmission setting, we estimated a median IgG half-life of 3 years and a seroreversion rate of 2.5 (95% CI: 1.6, 3.5) per 100 person-years.","715":"Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 remains a problem globally. Malawi introduced 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in 2011, but there has been no direct protection against serotype 3 carriage. We explored whether vaccine escape by serotype 3 is due to clonal expansion of a lineage with a competitive advantage.Serotype 3 GPSC10-ST700 isolates were most prominent in Malawi. Compared with the prototypical serotype 3 capsular polysaccharide locus sequence, 6 genes are absent, with retention of capsule polysaccharide biosynthesis. This lineage is characterized by increased antimicrobial resistance and lower susceptibility to opsonophagocytic killing.A serotype 3 variant in Malawi has genotypic and phenotypic characteristics that could enhance vaccine escape and clonal expansion after post-PCV13 introduction. Genomic surveillance among high-burden populations is essential to improve the effectiveness of next-generation pneumococcal vaccines.The distribution of serotype 3 Global Pneumococcal Sequence Clusters (GPSCs) and sequence types (STs) globally was assessed using sequences from the Global Pneumococcal Sequencing Project. Whole-genome sequences of 135 serotype 3 carriage isolates from Blantyre, Malawi (2015-2019) were analyzed. Comparative analysis of the capsule locus, entire genomes, antimicrobial resistance, and phylogenetic reconstructions were undertaken. Opsonophagocytosis was evaluated using serum samples from vaccinated adults and children.","716":"To characterize the use of private services in infant vaccination and assess vaccination coverage according to the service used.: This was a national vaccination survey conducted in 2020 that estimated the use of private vaccination services and vaccination coverage among infants residing in state capitals and 12 inland municipalities.: Of the 37,801 participants, 25.1% (95%CI 23.2;27.2) used private services at least once, with higher proportions in capitals, larger cities and in the South and Southeast regions. Socioeconomic and demographic differences were identified among families, based on the service used. The coverage for the set of vaccines administered up to 24 months was 60.3% (95%CI 58.6;62.0) in the public service and 59.5% (95%CI 55.9;63.0) in private services, and up-to-date vaccines, 10.3% (95%CI 9.1;11.6) and 9.4% (95%CI 7.4;11.8), respectively.The use of private services was frequent, with low coverage for the set of vaccines, regardless of the type of service used, especially for up-to-date vaccines.","717":"To identify key mosquito vectors involved in transmission, we incorporated long-term, finely resolved mosquito surveillance data and dog heartworm case data in a statistical modeling approach (fixed-effects regression) that rigorously controls for other unobserved drivers of heartworm cases. We then used a flexible machine learning approach (gradient boosted machines) to identify the climate and land cover variables associated with the presence of each species.We found significant, regionally specific, positive associations between dog heartworm cases and the abundance of four vector species: Aedes aegypti (Central California), Ae. albopictus (Southern California), Ae. sierrensis (Central California), and Culiseta incidens (Northern and Central California). The proportion of developed land cover was one of the most important ecological variables predicting the presence or absence of the putative vector species.Our results implicate three previously under-recognized vectors of dog heartworm transmission in California and indicate the land cover types in which each putative vector species is commonly found. Efforts to target these species could prioritize surveillance in these land cover types (e.g. near human dwellings in less urbanized settings for Ae. albopictus and Cs. incidens) but further investigation on the natural infection prevalence and host-biting rates of these species, as well as the other local vectors, is needed.Effectively controlling heartworm disease-a major parasitic disease threatening animal health in the US and globally-requires understanding the local ecology of mosquito vectors involved in transmission. However, the key vector species in a given region are often unknown and challenging to identify. Here we investigate (i) the key vector species associated with transmission of the parasite, Dirofilaria immitis, in California and (ii) the climate and land cover drivers of vector presence.","718":"We fitted compartmental mathematical models to pre-pandemic U.S. surveillance data (2012-2019) for norovirus and rotavirus using maximum likelihood estimation. Then, we projected incidence for 2022-2030 under scenarios where the number of contacts a person has per day varies from70%, 80%, 90%, and full resumption (100%) of pre-pandemic levels.These results, which quantify the consequences of population susceptibility build-up, can help public health agencies prepare for potential resurgence of enteric viruses.To reduce the burden from the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, federal and state local governments implemented restrictions such as limitations on gatherings, restaurant dining, and travel, and recommended non-pharmaceutical interventions including physical distancing, mask-wearing, surface disinfection, and increased hand hygiene. Resulting behavioral changes impacted other infectious diseases including enteropathogens such as norovirus and rotavirus, which had fairly regular seasonal patterns prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The study objective was to project future incidence of norovirus and rotavirus gastroenteritis as contacts resumed and other NPIs are relaxed.We found that the population susceptibility to both viruses increased between March 2020 and November 2021. The 70-90% contact resumption scenarios led to lower incidence than observed pre-pandemic for both viruses. However, we found a greater than two-fold increase in community incidence relative to the pre-pandemic period under the 100% contact scenarios for both viruses. With rotavirus, for which population immunity is driven partially by vaccination, patterns settled into a new steady state quickly in 2022 under the 70-90% scenarios. For norovirus, for which immunity is relatively short-lasting and only acquired through infection, surged under the 100% contact scenario projection.","719":"We used the COVID-19 U.S. State Policy database to document gaps in COVID-19 data reporting for AI\/AN people.The lack of AI\/AN-specific data masks the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 and presents challenges to COVID-19 prevention, policy implementation, and health equity.Public-facing data disaggregated by race may facilitate rapid response COVID-19 research and policymaking to support AI\/AN communities.Complete COVID-19 data for American Indian\/Alaska Native (AI\/AN) populations are critical to equitable pandemic response.Sixty-four percent of states do not report AI\/AN data for at least one COVID-19 health metric: cases, hospitalizations, deaths, or vaccinations.","720":"Infecting large portions of the global population, seasonal influenza is a major burden on societies around the globe. While the global source sink dynamics of the different seasonal influenza viruses have been studied intensively, its local spread remains less clear. In order to improve our understanding of how influenza is transmitted on a city scale, we collected an extremely densely sampled set of influenza sequences alongside patient metadata. To do so, we sequenced influenza viruses isolated from patients of two different hospitals, as well as private practitioners in Basel, Switzerland during the 2016\/2017 influenza season. The genetic sequences reveal that repeated introductions into the city drove the influenza season. We then reconstruct how the effective reproduction number changed over the course of the season. While we did not find that transmission dynamics in Basel correlate with humidity or school closures, we did find some evidence that it may positively correlated with temperature. Alongside the genetic sequence data that allows us to see how individual cases are connected, we gathered patient information, such as the age or household status. Zooming into the local transmission outbreaks suggests that the elderly were to a large extent infected within their own transmission network. In the remaining transmission network, our analyses suggest that school-aged children likely play a more central role than pre-school aged children. These patterns will be valuable to plan interventions combating the spread of respiratory diseases within cities given that similar patterns are observed for other influenza seasons and cities.","721":"Air pollution and neighborhood socioeconomic status (N-SES) are associated with adverse cardiovascular health and neuropsychiatric functioning in older adults. This study examines the degree to which the joint effects of air pollution and N-SES on the cognitive decline are mediated by high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure (HBP), and depression. In the Emory Healthy Aging Study, 14,390 participants aged 50+ years from Metro Atlanta, GA, were assessed for subjective cognitive decline using the cognitive function instrument (CFI). Information on the prior diagnosis of high cholesterol, HBP, and depression was collected through the Health History Questionnaire. Participants' census tracts were assigned 3-year average concentrations of 12 air pollutants and 16\u202fN-SES characteristics. We used the unsupervised clustering algorithm Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) to create 6 exposure clusters based on the joint distribution of air pollution and N-SES in each census tract. Linear regression analysis was used to estimate the effects of the SOM cluster indicator on CFI, adjusting for age, race\/ethnicity, education, and neighborhood residential stability. The proportion of the association mediated by high cholesterol levels, HBP, and depression was calculated by comparing the total and direct effects of SOM clusters on CFI. Depression mediated up to 87\u202f% of the association between SOM clusters and CFI. For example, participants living in the high N-SES and high air pollution cluster had CFI scores 0.05 (95\u202f%-CI:0.01,0.09) points higher on average compared to those from the high N-SES and low air pollution cluster; after adjusting for depression, this association was attenuated to 0.01 (95\u202f%-CI:-0.04,0.05). HBP mediated up to 8\u202f% of the association between SOM clusters and CFI and high cholesterol up to 5\u202f%. Air pollution and N-SES associated cognitive decline was partially mediated by depression. Only a small portion (<10\u202f%) of the association was mediated by HBP and high cholesterol.","722":"Eco-evolutionary theory argues that population cycles in consumer-resource interactions are partly driven by natural selection, such that changes in densities and changes in trait values are mutually reinforcing. Evidence that the theory explains cycles in nature, however, is almost nonexistent. Experimental tests of model assumptions are logistically impractical for most organisms, while for others, evidence that population cycles occur in nature is lacking. For insect baculoviruses in contrast, tests of model assumptions are straightforward, and there is strong evidence that baculoviruses help drive population cycles in many insects, including the gypsy moth that we study here. We therefore used field experiments with the gypsy moth baculovirus to test two key assumptions of eco-evolutionary models of host-pathogen population cycles: that reduced host infection risk is heritable and that it is costly. Our experiments confirm both assumptions, and inserting parameters estimated from our data into eco-evolutionary insect-outbreak models gives cycles closely resembling gypsy moth outbreak cycles in North America, whereas standard models predict unrealistic stable equilibria. Our work shows that eco-evolutionary models are useful for explaining outbreaks of forest insect defoliators, while widespread observations of intense selection on defoliators in nature and of heritable and costly resistance in defoliators in the lab together suggest that eco-evolutionary dynamics may play a general role in defoliator outbreaks.","723":"Areal spatial misalignment, which occurs when data on multiple variables are collected using mismatched boundary definitions, is a ubiquitous obstacle to data analysis in public health and social science research. As one example, the emerging sub-field studying the links between political context and health in the United States faces significant spatial misalignment-related challenges, as the congressional districts (CDs) over which political metrics are measured and administrative units, e.g., counties, for which health data are typically released, have a complex misalignment structure. Standard population-weighted data realignment procedures can induce measurement error and invalidate inference, which has prompted the development of fully model-based approaches for analyzing spatially misaligned data. One such approach, atom-based regression models (ABRM), holds particular promise but has scarcely been used in practice due to the lack of appropriate software or examples of implementation. ABRM use \"atoms\", the areas created by intersecting all sets of units on which variables of interest are measured, as the units of analysis and build models for the atom-level data, treating the atom-level variables (generally unmeasured) as latent variables. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility and strengths of the ABRM in a case study of the association between political representatives' voting behavior (CD-level) and COVID-19 mortality rates (county-level) in a post-vaccine period. The adjusted ABRM results suggest that more conservative voting record is associated with an increase in COVID-19 mortality rates, with estimated associations smaller in magnitude but consistent in direction with those of standard realignment methods. The results also indicate that ABRM may enable more robust confounding adjustment and more realistic uncertainty estimates, properly representing the uncertainties arising from all analytic procedures. We also implement the ABRM in modern optimized Bayesian computing programs and make our code publicly available, which may enable these methods to be more widely adopted.","724":"Many studies analyzed fatal alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes or cirrhosis\/liver disease mortality. Fewer analyzed other mortality causes related to chronic alcohol consumption. No studies focused on racism and discrimination, community-level prevention activities, or community social services in relation to alcohol-related mortality. Few studies examined major health policy changes or addressed health care system factors. Although the variation across studies complicates systematic comparison of the results, some key themes did emerge from the reviewed studies, such as the beneficial effects of stronger alcohol policies and the importance of socioeconomic conditions as determinants of alcohol-related mortality. Research using a more diverse set of theoretically informed social determinants may help examine whether, how, and for whom racism and discrimination as well as health policies and social services impact alcohol-related mortality. Finally, there is a gap in research linking local community contexts with alcohol-related mortality. Better understanding of subgroup differences, interactions between different contextual factors, and specific mechanisms of action may help identify promising new strategies to improve population health and reduce alcohol-related mortality.Rates of alcohol-related mortality (including deaths attributed to chronic alcohol use as well as acute causes involving alcohol) have been increasing in the United States, particularly for certain population subgroups, such as women. This review summarizes associations of area-level social determinants of health with alcohol-related mortality. These determinants, measured at the community, county, or state level, include alcohol control policies, health care availability, and a community's socioeconomic environment. Examining multiple geographic levels illuminates how macro-level social determinants and local contexts contribute to alcohol-related mortality to inform intervention. Attention to the broad variety of social determinants of alcohol-related mortality could ultimately improve community health.The authors screened 313 abstracts and excluded 210 that did not meet inclusion criteria. The full texts of 103 articles were retrieved. Upon further screening, 30 articles were excluded (two were not obtained), leaving 71 studies for detailed review.A literature search of three databases-PubMed, Web of Science, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL)-conducted between March 13 and May 16, 2023, identified peer-reviewed studies published from 1990 to May 2023 that modeled at least one area-level social determinant of health as a predictor or correlate of area-level rates of alcohol-related mortality in the United States. Unpublished dissertations, commentaries, editorials, review papers, and articles published in languages other than English were excluded. Two team members reviewed each abstract to verify that the article addressed alcohol-related mortality and included at least one area-level social determinant of health.","725":"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a spongiform encephalopathy disease caused by the transmission of infectious prion agents. CWD is a fatal disease that affects wild and farmed cervids in North America with few cases reported overseas. Social interaction of cervids, feeding practices by wildlife keepers and climate effects on the environmental carrying capacity all can affect CWD transmission in deer. Wildlife deer game hunting is economically important to the semi-arid South Texas region and is affected by climate change. In this paper, we model and investigate the effect of climate change on the spread of CWD using typical climate scenarios. We use a system of impulsive differential equations to depict the transmission of CWD between different age groups and gender of cervids. The carrying capacity and contact rates are assumed to depend on climate. Due to the polygamy of bucks, we use mating rates that depend on the number of bucks and does. We analyze the stability of the model and use simulations to study the effect of harvesting (culling) on eradicating the disease, given the climate of South Texas. We use typical climate change scenarios based on published data and our assumptions. For the climate indicator, we calculated and utilized the Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). We found that climate change might hinder the efforts to reduce and effectively manage CWD as it becomes endemic to South Texas. The model shows the extinction of the deer population from this region is a likely outcome.","726":"Characterising connectivity between geographically separated biological populations is a common goal in many fields. Recent approaches to understanding connectivity between malaria parasite populations, with implications for disease control efforts, have used estimates of relatedness based on identity-by-descent (IBD). However, uncertainty around estimated relatedness has not been accounted for. IBD-based relatedness estimates with uncertainty were computed for pairs of monoclonal Plasmodium falciparum samples collected from five cities on the Colombian-Pacific coast where long-term clonal propagation of P. falciparum is frequent. The cities include two official ports, Buenaventura and Tumaco, that are separated geographically but connected by frequent marine traffic. Fractions of highly-related sample pairs (whose classification using a threshold accounts for uncertainty) were greater within cities versus between. However, based on both highly-related fractions and on a threshold-free approach (Wasserstein distances between parasite populations) connectivity between Buenaventura and Tumaco was disproportionally high. Buenaventura-Tumaco connectivity was consistent with transmission events involving parasites from five clonal components (groups of statistically indistinguishable parasites identified under a graph theoretic framework). To conclude, P. falciparum population connectivity on the Colombian-Pacific coast abides by accessibility not isolation-by-distance, potentially implicating marine traffic in malaria transmission with opportunities for targeted intervention. Further investigations are required to test this hypothesis. For the first time in malaria epidemiology (and to our knowledge in ecological and epidemiological studies more generally), we account for uncertainty around estimated relatedness (an important consideration for studies that plan to use genotype versus whole genome sequence data to estimate IBD-based relatedness); we also use threshold-free methods to compare parasite populations and identify clonal components. Threshold-free methods are especially important in analyses of malaria parasites and other recombining organisms with mixed mating systems where thresholds do not have clear interpretation (e.g. due to clonal propagation) and thus undermine the cross-comparison of studies.","727":"Aedes (Stegomyia)-borne diseases are an expanding global threat, but gaps in surveillance make comprehensive and comparable risk assessments challenging. Geostatistical models combine data from multiple locations and use links with environmental and socioeconomic factors to make predictive risk maps. Here we systematically review past approaches to map risk for different Aedes-borne arboviruses from local to global scales, identifying differences and similarities in the data types, covariates, and modelling approaches used.We found a growing number of arbovirus risk mapping studies across all endemic regions and arboviral diseases, with a total of 176 papers published 2002-2022 with the largest increases shortly following major epidemics. Three dominant use cases emerged: (i) global maps to identify limits of transmission, estimate burden and assess impacts of future global change, (ii) regional models used to predict the spread of major epidemics between countries and (iii) national and sub-national models that use local datasets to better understand transmission dynamics to improve outbreak detection and response. Temperature and rainfall were the most popular choice of covariates (included in 50% and 40% of studies respectively) but variables such as human mobility are increasingly being included. Surprisingly, few studies (22%, 31\/144) robustly tested combinations of covariates from different domains (e.g. climatic, sociodemographic, ecological, etc.) and only 49% of studies assessed predictive performance via out-of-sample validation procedures.Here we show that approaches to map risk for different arboviruses have diversified in response to changing use cases, epidemiology and data availability. We identify key differences in mapping approaches between different arboviral diseases, discuss future research needs and outline specific recommendations for future arbovirus mapping.We searched on-line databases for predictive risk mapping studies for dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever with no geographical or date restrictions. We included studies that needed to parameterise or fit their model to real-world epidemiological data and make predictions to new spatial locations of some measure of population-level risk of viral transmission (e.g. incidence, occurrence, suitability, etc.).","728":"The swift development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has been met with worldwide commendation. However, in the context of an ongoing pandemic there is an interplay between infection and vaccination. While infection can grow exponentially, vaccination rates are generally limited by supply and logistics. With the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccines receiving medical approval requiring two doses, there has been scrutiny on the spacing between doses; an elongated period between doses allows more of the population to receive a first vaccine dose in the short-term generating wide-spread partial immunity. Focusing on data from England, we investigated prioritization of a one dose or two dose vaccination schedule given a fixed number of vaccine doses and with respect to a measure of maximizing averted deaths. We optimized outcomes for two different estimates of population size and relative risk of mortality for at-risk groups within the Phase 1 vaccine priority order. Vaccines offering relatively high protection from the first dose favour strategies that prioritize giving more people one dose, although with increasing vaccine supply eventually those eligible and accepting vaccination will receive two doses. While optimal dose timing can substantially reduce the overall mortality risk, there needs to be careful consideration of the logistics of vaccine delivery.","729":"Reusable elastomeric half-mask respirators (EHMR) are an alternative to address shortages of disposable respirators. While respirator discomfort has been noted as a barrier to adherence to wearing an N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) among health care personnel (HCP), few have examined EHMR comfort while providing patient care, which was the purpose of this study.The HCP reported an improved overall R-COMFI score (lower score more favorable, 30.0 vs. 28.7\/47, respectively) from Week 2 to Week 10. Many individual item scores improved or remained low over this period, except difficulty communicating with patients and coworkers. The overall R-COMFI scores for the EHMR were more favorable than for the N95 FFR (33.7 vs. 37.4, respectively), with a large proportion of workers indicating their perception that EHMR fit better, provided better protection, and they preferred to wear it in pandemic conditions compared with the N95 FFR.Among a cohort of 183 HCP, we prospectively examined how HCP rated EHMR tolerability using the Respirator Comfort, Wearing Experience, and Function Instrument (R-COMFI) questionnaire at Study Week 2 and Week 10. At the completion of the study (Week-12), HCP compared EHMR comfort with their prior N95 FFR use. Overall R-COMFI scores and three subscales (comfort, wear experience, and function) were examined as well as individual item scores.Findings suggest that the EHMR is a feasible respiratory protection device with respect to tolerance. EHMRs can be considered as a possible alternative to the N95 FFR in the health care setting. Future work is needed in the EHMR design to improve communication.","730":"with In this Article, Angela M.

Considering that diseases and drug responses are co-expressed and regulated in the relevant omics data interactions, the traditional way of grabbing omics data from single isolated layers cannot always obtain valuable inference. Also, drugs have adverse effects that may impair patients, and launching new medicines for diseases is costly. To resolve the above difficulties, systems biology is applied to predict potential molecular interactions by integrating omics data from genomic, proteomic, transcriptional, and metabolic layers. Combined with known drug reactions, the resulting models improve medicines' therapeutical performance by re-purposing the existing drugs and combining drug molecules without off-target effects. Based on the identified computational models, drug administration control laws are designed to balance toxicity and efficacy. This review introduces biomedical applications and analyses of interactions among gene, protein and drug molecules for modeling disease mechanisms and drug responses. The therapeutical performance can be improved by combining the predictive and computational models with drug administration designed by control laws. The challenges are also discussed for its clinical uses in this work.","732":"Scenario-based modeling frameworks have been widely used to support policy-making at state and federal levels in the United States during the COVID-19 response. While custom-built models can be used to support one-off studies, sustained updates to projections under changing pandemic conditions requires a robust, integrated, and adaptive framework. In this paper, we describe one such framework, UVA-adaptive, that was built to support the CDC-aligned Scenario Modeling Hub (SMH) across multiple rounds, as well as weekly\/biweekly projections to Virginia Department of Health (VDH) and US Department of Defense during the COVID-19 response. Building upon an existing metapopulation framework, PatchSim, UVA-adaptive uses a calibration mechanism relying on adjustable effective transmissibility as a basis for scenario definition while also incorporating real-time datasets on case incidence, seroprevalence, variant characteristics, and vaccine uptake. Through the pandemic, our framework evolved by incorporating available data sources and was extended to capture complexities of multiple strains and heterogeneous immunity of the population. Here we present the version of the model that was used for the recent projections for SMH and VDH, describe the calibration and projection framework, and demonstrate that the calibrated transmissibility correlates with the evolution of the pathogen as well as associated societal dynamics.","733":"We conducted a systematic review that included prospective cohorts reporting both receipt of systemic antimicrobials and acquired ESBL-PE isolated from stool or rectum during international travel. We performed a random effects meta-analysis to estimate odds of acquiring ESBL-PE due to antimicrobials during travel, overall and by antimicrobial class.International travel is an important risk factor for colonization with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE). Antimicrobial use during travel likely amplifies this risk, yet to what extent, and whether it varies by antimicrobial class, has not been established.Fifteen studies were included. The study population was mainly female travellers from high income countries recruited primarily from travel clinics. Participants travelled most frequently to Asia and Africa with 10% reporting antimicrobial use during travel. The combined odds ratio (OR) for ESBL-PE acquisition during travel was 2.37 for antimicrobial use overall (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.69 to 3.33), but there was substantial heterogeneity between studies. Fluoroquinolones were the antibiotic class associated with the highest combined OR of ESBL-PE acquisition, compared to no antimicrobial use (OR 4.68, 95% CI, 2.34 to 9.37).The risk of ESBL-PE colonization during travel is increased substantially with exposure to antimicrobials, especially fluoroquinolones. While a small proportion of colonized individuals will develop a resistant infection, there remains the potential for onward spread among returning travellers. Public health efforts to decrease inappropriate antimicrobial usage during travel are warranted.","734":"Many models of learning in teams assume that team members can share solutions or learn concurrently. However, these assumptions break down in multidisciplinary teams where team members often complete distinct, interrelated pieces of larger tasks. Such contexts make it difficult for individuals to separate the performance effects of their own actions from the actions of interacting neighbors. In this work, we show that individuals can overcome this challenge by learning from network neighbors through mediating artifacts (like collective performance assessments). When neighbors' actions influence collective outcomes, teams with different networks perform relatively similarly to one another. However, varying a team's network can affect performance on tasks that weight individuals' contributions by network properties. Consequently, when individuals innovate (through \"exploring\" searches), dense networks hurt performance slightly by increasing uncertainty. In contrast, dense networks moderately help performance when individuals refine their work (through \"exploiting\" searches) by efficiently finding local optima. We also find that decentralization improves team performance across a battery of 34 tasks. Our results offer design principles for multidisciplinary teams within which other forms of learning prove more difficult.","735":"The factors affecting the transmission and geographic translocation of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) within wild migratory bird populations remain inadequately understood. In a previous study, we found that environmental transmission had little impact on AIV translocation in a model of a single migratory bird population. In order to simulate virus transmission and translocation more realistically, here we expanded this model system to include two migratory bird flocks. We simulated AIV transmission and translocation while varying four core properties: 1) Contact transmission rate; 2) infection recovery rate; 3) infection-induced mortality rate; and 4) migration recovery rate; and three environmental transmission properties: 1) Virion persistence; 2) exposure rate; and 3) re-scaled environmental infectiousness; as well as the time lag in the migration schedule of the two flocks. We found that environmental exposure rate had a significant impact on virus translocation in the two-flock model. Further, certain epidemiological features (i.e., low infection recovery rate, low mortality rate, and high migration transmission rate) in both flocks strongly affected the likelihood of virus translocation. Our results further identified the pathobiological features supporting AIV intercontinental dissemination risk.","736":"Feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) commonly cause mild enteric infections in felines worldwide (termed feline enteric coronavirus [FECV]), with around 12 per cent\u2009developing into deadly feline infectious peritonitis (FIP; feline infectious peritonitis virus [FIPV]). Genomic differences between FECV and FIPV have been reported, yet the putative genotypic basis of the highly pathogenic phenotype remains unclear. Here, we used state-of-the-art molecular evolutionary genetic statistical techniques to identify and compare differences in natural selection pressure between FECV and FIPV sequences, as well as to identify FIPV- and FECV-specific signals of positive selection. We analyzed full-length FCoV protein coding genes thought to contain mutations associated with FIPV (Spike, ORF3abc, and ORF7ab). We identified two sites exhibiting differences in natural selection pressure between FECV and FIPV: one within the S1\/S2 furin cleavage site (FCS) and the other within the fusion domain of Spike. We also found fifteen sites subject to positive selection associated with FIPV within Spike, eleven of which have not previously been suggested as possibly relevant to FIP development. These sites fall within Spike protein subdomains that participate in host cell receptor interaction, immune evasion, tropism shifts, host cellular entry, and viral escape. There were fourteen sites (twelve novel sites) within Spike under positive selection associated with the FECV phenotype, almost exclusively within the S1\/S2 FCS and adjacent to C domain, along with a signal of relaxed selection in FIPV relative to FECV, suggesting that furin cleavage functionality may not be needed for FIPV. Positive selection inferred in ORF7b was associated with the FECV phenotype and included twenty-four positively selected sites, while ORF7b had signals of relaxed selection in FIPV. We found evidence of positive selection in ORF3c in FCoV-wide analyses, but no specific association with the FIPV or FECV phenotype. We hypothesize that some combination of mutations in FECV may contribute to FIP development, and that it is unlikely to be one singular 'switch' mutational event. This work expands our understanding of the complexities of FIP development and provides insights into how evolutionary forces may alter pathogenesis in coronavirus genomes.","737":"There have been multiple instances of novel pathogen emergence that have affected the health and security of the global community. To highlight that these novel pathogens presented a clear danger to public health, the WHO included \"Disease X\" on their list of priority pathogens in 2018. Indeed, since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, Disease X has been pointed to as the looming threat of \"the next big thing.\" However, developing surveillance and preparedness plans with Disease X as the linchpin is too narrow and ignores a large swath of potential threats from already identified, often neglected diseases. We propose instead the idea of \"Disease f(x)\" as a preferred call to arms with which to prioritize research and programmatic development. The common mathematical notation f(x) represents the knowledge that outbreaks are a function of many variables that define the transmission trajectory of that pathogen. Disease f(x) exploits commonalities across pathogen groupings while recognizing that emergences and outbreaks are fluid and that responses need to be agile and progressively tailored to specific pathogens with cultural and regional context. Adoption of this mindset across sectors, including biotechnology, disaster management, and epidemiology, will allow us to develop more efficient and effective responses to address the next major infectious threat.","738":"Companion animals have been shown to carry Clostridioides difficile strains that are similar or identical to strains found in people, and a small number of studies have shown that pets carry genetically identical C. difficile isolates as their owners, suggesting inter-species transmission. However, the directionality of transmission is ultimately unknown, and the frequency with which animals acquire C. difficile following their owners' infection is unclear. The goal of this study was to assess how often pets belonging to people with C. difficile infection carry genetically related C. difficile isolates. We enrolled pet owners from two medical institutions (University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) and The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC)) who had diarrhoea with or without positive C. difficile assays and tested their faeces and their pets' faeces for C. difficile using both anaerobic culture and PCR assays. When microorganisms were obtained from both the owner and pet and had the same toxin profile or ribotype, isolates underwent genomic sequencing. Faecal samples were obtained from a total of 59 humans, 72 dogs and 9 cats, representing 47 complete households (i.e. where a sample was available from the owner and at least one pet). Of these, C. difficile was detected in 30 humans, 10 dogs and 0 cats. There were only two households where C. difficile was detected in both the owner and pet. In one of these households, the C. difficile isolates were of different toxin profiles\/ribotypes (A+\/B+ \/ RT 499 from the owner, A-\/B- \/ RT PR22386 from the dog). In the other household, the isolates were genetically identical (one SNP difference). Interestingly, the dog from this household had recently received a course of antibiotics (cefpodoxime and metronidazole). Our findings suggest that inter-species transmission of C. difficile occurs infrequently in households with human C. difficile infections.","739":"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been found to be associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) development, a maternal health disorder in pregnancy with negative effects that can extend beyond pregnancy. Studies that report on this association are difficult to summarize due to weak associations and wide confidence intervals. One way to advance this field is to sharpen the biologic theory on a causal pathway behind this association, and to measure it directly by way of molecular biomarkers. The aim of this review is to summarize the literature that supports a novel pathway between PFAS exposure and GDM development. Epidemiological studies demonstrate a clear association of biomarkers of thyroid hormones and glucose metabolism with GDM development. We report biologic plausibility and epidemiologic evidence that PFAS dysregulation of maternal thyroid hormones and thyrotropin (TSH) may disrupt glucose homeostasis, increasing the risk of GDM. Overall, epidemiological studies demonstrate that PFAS were positively associated with TSH and negatively with triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). PFAS were generally positively associated with glucose and insulin levels in pregnancy. We propose dysregulation of thyroid function and glucose metabolism may be a critical and missing component in the accurate estimation of PFAS on the risk of GDM.","740":"-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc). Half of subjects that received an egg-grown vaccine mounted an antibody response against this egg-derived antigen. Egg-binding monoclonal antibodies specifically bind viruses grown in eggs, but not viruses grown in other chicken-derived cells, suggesting that only egg-grown vaccines can induce antiegg antibodies. Notably, antibodies against the egg antigen utilized a restricted antibody repertoire and possessed features of natural antibodies, as most antibodies were IgM and had a simple heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3. By analyzing a public data set of influenza virus vaccine-induced plasmablasts, we discovered egg-binding public clonotypes that were shared across studies. Together, this study shows that egg-grown vaccines can induce antibodies against an egg-associated glycan, which may divert the host immune response away from protective epitopes.","741":"Understanding how emerging infectious diseases spread within and between countries is essential to contain future pandemics. Spread to new areas requires connectivity between one or more sources and a suitable local environment, but how these two factors interact at different stages of disease emergence remains largely unknown. Further, no analytical framework exists to examine their roles. Here we develop a dynamic modelling approach for infectious diseases that explicitly models both connectivity via human movement and environmental suitability interactions. We apply it to better understand recently observed (1995-2019) patterns as well as predict past unobserved (1983-2000) and future (2020-2039) spread of dengue in Mexico and Brazil. We find that these models can accurately reconstruct long-term spread pathways, determine historical origins, and identify specific routes of invasion. We find early dengue invasion is more heavily influenced by environmental factors, resulting in patchy non-contiguous spread, while short and long-distance connectivity becomes more important\u00a0in later\u00a0stages. Our results have immediate practical applications for forecasting and containing the spread of dengue and emergence of new serotypes. Given current and future trends in human mobility, climate, and zoonotic spillover, understanding the interplay between connectivity and environmental suitability will be increasingly necessary to contain emerging and re-emerging pathogens.","742":"The ability to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) will increase bnAb therapeutic benefits. Machine learning is a powerful approach for such prediction. One challenge is that some HIV-1 subtypes in currently available training datasets are underrepresented, which likely affects models' generalizability across subtypes. A second challenge is that combinations of bnAbs are required to avoid the inevitable resistance to a single bnAb, and computationally determining optimal combinations of bnAbs is an unsolved problem. Recently, machine learning models trained using resistance outcomes for multiple antibodies at once, a strategy called multi-task learning (MTL), have been shown to improve predictions. We develop a new model and show that, beyond the boost in performance, MTL also helps address the previous two challenges. Specifically, we demonstrate empirically that MTL can mitigate bias from underrepresented subtypes, and that MTL allows the model to learn patterns of co-resistance to combinations of antibodies, thus providing tools to predict antibodies' epitopes and to potentially select optimal bnAb combinations. Our analyses, publicly available at https:\/\/github.com\/iaime\/LBUM, can be adapted to other infectious diseases that are treated with antibody therapy.","743":"There are different patterns in the COVID-19 outbreak in the general population and amongst nursing home patients. We investigate the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and hospitalization or the length of stay (LoS) in the hospital, and whether there are differences in the population. Sciensano collected information on 14,618 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 admissions from 114 Belgian hospitals between 14 March and 12 June 2020. The distributions of different event times for different patient groups are estimated accounting for interval censoring and right truncation of the time intervals. The time between symptom onset and hospitalization or diagnosis are similar, with median length between symptom onset and hospitalization ranging between 3 and 10.4 days, depending on the age of the patient (longest delay in age group 20-60 years) and whether or not the patient lives in a nursing home (additional 2 days for patients from nursing home). The median LoS in hospital varies between 3 and 10.4 days, with the LoS increasing with age. The hospital LoS for patients that recover is shorter for patients living in a nursing home, but the time to death is longer for these patients. Over the course of the first wave, the LoS has decreased.","744":" in India, Japan, and China, respectively.

To achieve continental elimination of transmission, mapping surveys will need to be conducted across all implementation units (IUs) for which endemicity status is currently unknown. Using boosted regression tree models with optimised hyperparameter selection, we estimated environmental suitability for onchocerciasis at the 5 \u00d7 5-km resolution across Africa. In order to classify IUs that include locations that are environmentally suitable, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to identify an optimal threshold for suitability concordant with locations where onchocerciasis has been previously detected. This threshold value was then used to classify IUs (more suitable or less suitable) based on the location within the IU with the largest mean prediction. Mean estimates of environmental suitability suggest large areas across West and Central Africa, as well as focal areas of East Africa, are suitable for onchocerciasis transmission, consistent with the presence of current control and elimination of transmission efforts. The ROC analysis identified a mean environmental suitability index of 0\u00b771 as a threshold to classify based on the location with the largest mean prediction within the IU. Of the IUs considered for mapping surveys, 50\u00b72% exceed this threshold for suitability in at least one 5 \u00d7 5-km location. The formidable scale of data collection required to map onchocerciasis endemicity across the African continent presents an opportunity to use spatial data to identify areas likely to be suitable for onchocerciasis transmission. National onchocerciasis elimination programmes may wish to consider prioritising these IUs for mapping surveys as human resources, laboratory capacity, and programmatic schedules may constrain survey implementation, and possibly delaying MDA initiation in areas that would ultimately qualify.","746":"Objectives. To determine whether the Communities That HEAL (CTH) intervention is effective in increasing naloxone distribution compared with usual care. Methods. The HEALing (Helping to End Addiction Long-Term) Communities Study (HCS) is a cluster-randomized, parallel-arm, wait-list controlled implementation science trial testing the impact of the CTH intervention on increasing the use of evidence-based practices to lower opioid-related overdose deaths. Communities (n\u2009=\u200967) highly impacted by opioid overdose in Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio were allocated to CTH intervention (n\u2009=\u200934) or wait-list comparison (usual care; n\u2009=\u200933) arms. The primary outcome for this study was the number of naloxone units distributed in HCS communities during the comparison period (July 1, 2021\u2012June 30, 2022), examined using an intent-to-treat negative binomial regression model. Results. Naloxone distribution was 79% higher in the CTH intervention versus usual care arm (adjusted relative rate\u2009=\u20091.79; 95% confidence interval\u2009=\u20091.28, 2.51; P\u2009=\u2009.001; adjusted rates of naloxone distribution 3378 vs 1884 naloxone units per 100\u2009000 residents), when controlling for urban\u2012rural status, state, baseline opioid-related overdose death rate, and baseline naloxone distribution rate. Conclusions. The CTH intervention increased naloxone distribution compared with usual care in communities highly impacted by the opioid crisis. Trial Registration.

We allow for varying waning efficacy of vaccine-induced immunity, as this has not yet been measured. We account for the fact that known COVID-positive cases may not have been included in the first round of vaccination. And, we account for age-specific immune patterns in both states at the time of the start of the vaccination program. Our analysis assumes that health systems during winter 2020-2021 had equal staffing and capacity to previous phases of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic; we do not consider the effects of understaffed hospitals or unvaccinated medical staff.Assuming high vaccination coverage (>28%) and no major changes in distancing, masking, gathering size, hygiene guidelines, and virus transmissibility between 1 January 2021 and 1 July 2021 a combination of vaccination and population immunity may lead to low or near-zero transmission levels by the second quarter of 2021.We find that allocating a substantial proportion (>75%) of vaccine supply to individuals over the age of 70 is optimal in terms of reducing total cumulative deaths through mid-2021. This result is robust to different profiles of waning vaccine efficacy and several different assumptions on age mixing during and after lockdown periods. As we do not explicitly model other high-mortality groups, our results on vaccine allocation apply to all groups at high risk of mortality if infected. A median of 327 to 340 deaths can be avoided in Rhode Island (3444 to 3647 in Massachusetts) by optimizing vaccine allocation and vaccinating the elderly first. The vaccination campaigns are expected to save a median of 639 to 664 lives in Rhode Island and 6278 to 6618 lives in Massachusetts in the first half of 2021 when compared to a scenario with no vaccine. A policy of vaccinating only seronegative individuals avoids redundancy in vaccine use on individuals that may already be immune, and would result in 0.5% to 1% reductions in cumulative hospitalizations and deaths by mid-2021.When three SARS-CoV-2 vaccines came to market in Europe and North America in the winter of 2020-2021, distribution networks were in a race against a major epidemiological wave of SARS-CoV-2 that began in autumn 2020. Rapid and optimized vaccine allocation was critical during this time. With 95% efficacy reported for two of the vaccines, near-term public health needs likely require that distribution is prioritized to the elderly, health care workers, teachers, essential workers, and individuals with comorbidities putting them at risk of severe clinical progression.","748":"We find that the YoV methods estimate similar impact with routine vaccinations but have greater yearly variation when campaigns occur with the birth cohort stratification. The IE performs well for the YoV methods, providing a time-efficient mechanism for updates to impact estimates.Deaths due to vaccine preventable diseases cause a notable proportion of mortality worldwide. To quantify the importance of vaccination, it is necessary to estimate the burden averted through vaccination. The Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium (VIMC) was established to estimate the health impact of vaccination.We describe the methods implemented by the VIMC to estimate impact by calendar year, birth year and year of vaccination (YoV). The calendar and birth year methods estimate impact in a particular year and over the lifetime of a particular birth cohort, respectively. The YoV method estimates the impact of a particular year's vaccination activities through the use of impact ratios which have no stratification and stratification by activity type and\/or birth cohort. Furthermore, we detail an impact extrapolation (IE) method for use between coverage scenarios. We compare the methods, focusing on YoV for hepatitis B, measles and yellow fever.These methods provide a robust set of approaches to quantify vaccination impact; however it is vital that the area of impact estimation continues to develop in order to capture the full effect of immunisation.","749":"We used HIV surveillance data to describe primary and overall TDF\/FTC resistance and concurrent viremia among people living with HIV (PLWH). HIV genotypes conducted for clinical purposes are reported as part of HIV surveillance. We examined the prevalence of HIV strains with mutations conferring intermediate to high level resistance to TDF\/FTC, defining primary resistance (predominantly K65R and M184I\/V mutations) among sequences reported within 3 months of HIV diagnosis and total resistance for sequences reported at any time. We examined trends in primary resistance during 2010-2019 and total resistance among all PLWH in 2019. We also monitored resistance with viremia (\u22651,000 copies\/mL) at the end of 2019 among PLWH.The risk of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) failure with sufficient medication adherence is extremely low but has occurred due to transmission of a viral strain with mutations conferring resistance to PrEP components tenofovir (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC). The extent to which such strains are circulating in the population is unknown.Between 2010 and 2019, 2,172 King County residents were diagnosed with HIV; 1,557 (72%) had a genotypic resistance test within three months; three (0.2%) had primary TDF\/FTC resistance with both K65R and M184I\/V mutations. Adding isolated resistance for each drug resulted in 0.3% with primary TDF resistance and 0.8% with primary FTC resistance. Of 7,056 PLWH in 2019, 4,032 (57%) had genotype results, 241 (6%) had TDF\/FTC resistance and 15 (0.4% of those with a genotype result) had viremia and TDF\/FTC resistance.Primary resistance and viremia combined with TDF\/FTC resistance are uncommon in King County. Monitoring trends in TDF\/FTC resistance coupled with interventions to help ensure PLWH achieve and maintain viral suppression may help ensure that PrEP failure remains rare.","750":"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a (re)emerging mosquito-borne pathogen impacting human and animal health. How RVFV spreads through a population depends on population-level and individual-level interactions between vector, host and pathogen. Here, we estimated the probability for RVFV to transmit to naive animals by experimentally exposing lambs to a bite of an infectious mosquito, and assessed if and how RVFV infection subsequently developed in the exposed animal. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, previously infected via feeding on a viremic lamb, were used to expose naive lambs to the virus. Aedes aegypti colony mosquitoes were used as they are easy to maintain and readily feed in captivity. Other mosquito spp. could be examined with similar methodology. Lambs were exposed to either 1-3 (low exposure) or 7-9 (high exposure) infectious mosquitoes. All lambs in the high exposure group became viremic and showed characteristic signs of Rift Valley fever within 2-4 days post exposure. In contrast, 3 out of 12 lambs in the low exposure group developed viremia and disease, with similar peak-levels of viremia as the high exposure group but with some heterogeneity in the onset of viremia. These results suggest that the likelihood for successful infection of a ruminant host is affected by the number of infectious mosquitoes biting, but also highlights that a single bite of an infectious mosquito can result in disease. The per bite mosquito-to-host transmission efficiency was estimated at 28% (95% confidence interval: 15 - 47%). We subsequently combined this transmission efficiency with estimates for life traits of Aedes aegypti or related mosquitoes into a Ross-McDonald mathematical model to illustrate scenarios under which major RVFV outbreaks could occur in na\u00efve populations (i.e., R0 >1). The model revealed that relatively high vector-to-host ratios as well as mosquitoes feeding preferably on competent hosts are required for R0 to exceed 1. Altogether, this study highlights the importance of experiments that mimic natural exposure to RVFV. The experiments facilitate a better understanding of the natural progression of disease and a direct way to obtain epidemiological parameters for mathematical models.","751":"COVID-19 is challenging many societal institutions, including our criminal justice systems. Some have proposed or enacted (e.g., the State of New Jersey) reductions in the jail and\/or prison populations. We present a mathematical model to explore the epidemiologic impact of such interventions in jails and contrast them with the consequences of maintaining unaltered practices. We consider infection risk and likely in-custody deaths, and estimate how within-jail dynamics lead to spill-over risks, not only affecting incarcerated people but increasing exposure, infection, and death rates for both corrections officers and the broader community beyond the justice system. We show that, given a typical jail-community dynamic, operating in a business-as-usual way results in substantial, rapid, and ongoing loss of life. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that large-scale reductions in arrest and speeding of releases are likely to save the lives of incarcerated people, jail staff, and the wider community.","752":"We analyzed county-level data on rapid riser identification during June 1-September 30, 2020 and statewide closures and statewide mask mandates starting March 19 (obtained from state government websites). Poisson regression models with robust standard error estimation were used to examine differences in the probability of rapid riser identification by implementation of mitigation policies (P-value<.05); associations were adjusted for county population size.Community mitigation strategies could help reduce COVID-19 incidence. In a national county-level analysis, we examined the probability of being identified as a county with rapidly increasing COVID-19 incidence (rapid riser identification) during the summer of 2020 by implementation of mitigation policies prior to the summer, overall and by urbanicity.Counties in states that closed for 0-59 days were more likely to become a rapid riser county than those that closed for >59 days, particularly in nonmetropolitan areas. The probability of becoming a rapid riser county was 43% lower among counties that had statewide mask mandates at reopening (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR]\u202f=\u202f0.57; 95% confidence intervals [CI]\u202f=\u202f0.51-0.63); when stratified by urbanicity, associations were more pronounced in nonmetropolitan areas.These results underscore the potential value of community mitigation strategies in limiting the COVID-19 spread, especially in nonmetropolitan areas.","753":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the tuberculosis (TB) pathogen, despite a low level of genetic diversity, has revealed a high variety of biological and epidemiological characteristics linked to their lineages, such as transmissibility, fitness and propensity to acquire drug resistance. This has important implications for the epidemiology of TB. We conducted this first countrywide cross-sectional study to identify the prevalent M. tuberculosis lineages and to assess their epidemiological associations and their relation to drug resistance. The study was conducted among isolates acquired in reference hospitals across Vietnam. Isolates with drug susceptibility testing profiles were identified for their lineages by spoligotyping. Logistic regression was used to investigate the association of M. tuberculosis lineages with location, age and sex of the patients and drug resistance levels.Results showed that the most prevalent lineage was Beijing (55.4\u00a0%), followed by EAI (27.5\u00a0%), T (6.4\u00a0%), LAM (1.3\u00a0%), Haarlem (1\u00a0%) and Zero type (0.3\u00a0%). The proportion of Beijing isolates in the North (70.4\u00a0%) and the South (68\u00a0%) was higher than in the Centre (28\u00a0%) (OR\u2009=\u20091.7 [95\u00a0% CI: 1.4-2.0], p\u2009<\u20090.0001), whereas the proportion of EAI isolates in the North (7.1\u00a0%) and the South (17\u00a0%) was much lower compared with the Centre (59\u00a0%) (OR\u2009=\u20090.5 [95\u00a0% CI: 0.4-0.6], p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Overall, Beijing isolates were the most likely to be drug-resistant and EAI isolates were the least likely to be drug-resistant, except in the South of Vietnam where EAI is also highly drug-resistant. The proportion of Beijing isolates was significantly higher (p\u2009<\u20090.01), and the proportion of EAI isolates was significantly lower (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in younger patients. The proportion of drug-resistance was higher in isolates collected from male patients and from patients in the middle age groups.The findings suggest ongoing replacement of EAI lineage, which is mainly more drug-susceptible with highly drug-resistant Beijing lineage in all studied regions of Vietnam. Male patients of working ages should be the focus for better control to prevent the emergence of drug-resistant TB.","754":"Mathematical models have come to play a key role in global pandemic preparedness and outbreak response: helping to plan for disease burden, hospital capacity, and inform nonpharmaceutical interventions. Such models have played a pivotal role in the COVID-19 pandemic, with transmission models-and, by consequence, modelers-guiding global, national, and local responses to SARS-CoV-2. However, these models have largely not accounted for the social and structural factors, which lead to socioeconomic, racial, and geographic health disparities. In this piece, we raise and attempt to clarify several questions relating to this important gap in the research and practice of infectious disease modeling: Why do epidemiologic models of emerging infections typically ignore known structural drivers of disparate health outcomes? What have been the consequences of a framework focused primarily on aggregate outcomes on infection equity? What should be done to develop a more holistic approach to modeling-based decision-making during pandemics? In this review, we evaluate potential historical and political explanations for the exclusion of drivers of disparity in infectious disease models for emerging infections, which have often been characterized as \"equal opportunity infectors\" despite ample evidence to the contrary. We look to examples from other disease systems (HIV, STIs) and successes in including social inequity in models of acute infection transmission as a blueprint for how social connections, environmental, and structural factors can be integrated into a coherent, rigorous, and interpretable modeling framework. We conclude by outlining principles to guide modeling of emerging infections in ways that represent the causes of inequity in infection as central rather than peripheral mechanisms.","755":"Aims\r\nThe goal of this study was to explore various models for describing viral persistence (infectivity) on fomites and identify the best fit models.\r\n\r\nMethods and Results\r\nThe persistence of poliovirus over time was studied on three different fomite materials: steel, cotton and plastic. Known concentrations of poliovirus type 1 were applied to the surface coupons in an indoor environment for various lengths of time. Viruses were recovered from the surfaces by vortexing in phosphate buffer. Seven different mathematical models of relative persistence over time were fit to the data, and the preferred model for each surface was selected based on the Bayesian information criterion.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nWhile the preferred model varied by fomite type, the virus showed a rapid initial decay on all of the fomite types, followed by a transition to a more gradual decay after about 4\u00968 days. Estimates of the time for 99% reduction ranged from 81 h for plastic to 143 h for cotton. A 6 log reduction of recoverable infectivity of poliovirus did not occur during the 3\u2010week duration of the experiment for any of the fomites.\r\n\r\nSignificance and Impact of the Study\r\nIn protected indoor environments poliovirus can remain infective for weeks. The models identified by this study can be used in risk assessments to identify appropriate strategies for managing this risk.","756":"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection recently caused major epidemics in the Americas and is linked to congenital birth defects and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome. A pilot study of ZIKV infection in Nicaraguan households was conducted from August 31 to October 21, 2016, in Managua, Nicaragua. We enrolled 33 laboratory-confirmed Zika index cases and their household members (109 contacts) and followed them on days 3-4, 6-7, 9-10, and 21, collecting serum\/plasma, urine, and saliva specimens along with clinical, demographic, and socio-economic status information. Collected samples were processed by rRT-PCR to determine viral load (VL) and duration of detectable ZIKV RNA in human bodily fluids. At enrollment, 11 (10%) contacts were ZIKV rRT-PCR-positive and 23 (21%) were positive by IgM antibodies; 3 incident cases were detected during the study period. Twenty of 33 (61%) index households had contacts with ZIKV infection, with an average of 1.9 (range 1-6) positive contacts per household, and in 60% of these households, \u226550% of the members were positive for ZIKV infection. Analysis of clinical information allowed us to estimate the symptomatic to asymptomatic (S:A) ratio of 14:23 (1:1.6) among the contacts, finding 62% of the infections to be asymptomatic. The maximum number of days during which ZIKV RNA was detected was 7 days post-symptom onset in saliva and serum\/plasma and 22 days in urine. Overall, VL levels in serum\/plasma, saliva, and urine specimens were comparable, with means of 5.6, 5.3 and 4.5 log10 copies\/ml respectively, with serum attaining the highest VL peak at 8.1 log10 copies\/ml. Detecting ZIKV RNA in saliva over a similar time-period and level as in serum\/plasma indicates that saliva could potentially serve as a more accessible diagnostic sample. Finding the majority of infections to be asymptomatic emphasizes the importance of silent ZIKV transmission and helps inform public health interventions in the region and globally.","757":"There has been a great deal of interest recently in the modeling and simulation of dynamic networks, i.e., networks that change over time. One promising model is the separable temporal exponential-family random graph model (ERGM) of Krivitsky and Handcock, which treats the formation and dissolution of ties in parallel at each time step as independent ERGMs. However, the computational cost of fitting these models can be substantial, particularly for large, sparse networks. Fitting cross-sectional models for observations of a network at a single point in time, while still a non-negligible computational burden, is much easier. This paper examines model fitting when the available data consist of independent measures of cross-sectional network structure and the duration of relationships under the assumption of stationarity. We introduce a simple approximation to the dynamic parameters for sparse networks with relationships of moderate or long duration and show that the approximation method works best in precisely those cases where parameter estimation is most likely to fail-networks with very little change at each time step. We consider a variety of cases: Bernoulli formation and dissolution of ties, independent-tie formation and Bernoulli dissolution, independent-tie formation and dissolution, and dependent-tie formation models.","758":" or resistance elements to humans, the results also illustrate our limited ability to infer historical transmission events from even the best samples. The implications for the One Health framework, aiming to unify human and veterinary medicine, are discussed.","759":"Most hospitals use traditional infection prevention (IP) methods for outbreak detection. We developed the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission (EDS-HAT), which combines whole genome sequencing (WGS) surveillance and machine learning (ML) of the electronic health record (EHR) to identify undetected outbreaks and the responsible transmission routes, respectively.Of 3,165 isolates, there were 2,752 unique patient isolates in 99 clusters involving 297 (10.8%) patient isolates were identified by WGS; clusters ranged from 2-14 patients. At least one transmission route was detected for 65.7% of clusters. During the same time, traditional IP investigation prompted WGS for 15 suspected outbreaks involving 133 patients, for which transmission events were identified for 5 (3.8%). If EDS-HAT had been running in real-time, 25-63 transmissions could have been prevented. EDS-HAT was found to be cost-saving and more effective than traditional IP practice, with overall savings of $192,408 - $692,532.We performed WGS surveillance of healthcare-associated bacterial pathogens from November 2016 to November 2018. EHR ML was used to identify the transmission routes for WGS-detected outbreaks, which were investigated by an IP expert. Potential infections prevented were estimated and compared to traditional IP practice during the same period.EDS-HAT detected multiple outbreaks not identified using traditional IP methods, correctly identified the transmission routes for most outbreaks, and would save the hospital substantial costs. Traditional IP practice misidentified outbreaks for which transmission did not occur. WGS surveillance combined with EHR ML has the potential to save costs and enhance patient safety.","760":"Global spatial clustering is the tendency of points, here cases of infectious disease, to occur closer together than expected by chance. The extent of global clustering can provide a window into the spatial scale of disease transmission, thereby providing insights into the mechanism of spread, and informing optimal surveillance and control. Here the authors present an interpretable measure of spatial clustering, \u03c4, which can be understood as a measure of relative risk. When biological or temporal information can be used to identify sets of potentially linked and likely unlinked cases, this measure can be estimated without knowledge of the underlying population distribution. The greater our ability to distinguish closely related (i.e., separated by few generations of transmission) from more distantly related cases, the more closely \u03c4 will track the true scale of transmission. The authors illustrate this approach using examples from the analyses of HIV, dengue and measles, and provide an R package implementing the methods described. The statistic presented, and measures of global clustering in general, can be powerful tools for analysis of spatially resolved data on infectious diseases.","761":"Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, represent a potential mechanism for environmental impacts on human disease. Maternal smoking in pregnancy remains an important public health problem that impacts child health in a myriad of ways and has potential lifelong consequences. The mechanisms are largely unknown, but epigenetics most likely plays a role. We formed the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) consortium and meta-analyzed, across 13 cohorts (n = 6,685), the association between maternal smoking in pregnancy and newborn blood DNA methylation at over 450,000 CpG sites (CpGs) by using the Illumina 450K BeadChip. Over 6,000 CpGs were differentially methylated in relation to maternal smoking at genome-wide statistical significance (false discovery rate, 5%), including 2,965 CpGs corresponding to 2,017 genes not previously related to smoking and methylation in either newborns or adults. Several genes are relevant to diseases that can be caused by maternal smoking (e.g., orofacial clefts and asthma) or adult smoking (e.g., certain cancers). A number of differentially methylated CpGs were associated with gene expression. We observed enrichment in pathways and processes critical to development. In older children (5 cohorts, n = 3,187), 100% of CpGs gave at least nominal levels of significance, far more than expected by chance (p value < 2.2\u00a0\u00d7 10(-16)). Results were robust to different normalization methods used across studies and cell type adjustment. In this large scale meta-analysis of methylation data, we identified numerous loci involved in response to maternal smoking in pregnancy with persistence into later childhood and provide insights into mechanisms underlying effects of this important exposure. ","762":"Mutant dynamics in fragmented populations have been studied extensively in evolutionary biology. Yet, open questions remain, both experimentally and theoretically. Some of the fundamental properties predicted by models still need to be addressed experimentally. We contribute to this by using a combination of experiments and theory to investigate the role of migration in mutant distribution. In the case of neutral mutants, while the mean frequency of mutants is not influenced by migration, the probability distribution is. To address this empirically, we performed in vitro experiments, where mixtures of GFP-labelled (\"mutant\") and non-labelled (\"wid-type\") murine cells were grown in wells (demes), and migration was mimicked via cell transfer from well to well. In the presence of migration, we observed a change in the skewedness of the distribution of the mutant frequencies in the wells, consistent with previous and our own model predictions. In the presence of de novo mutant production, we used modelling to investigate the level at which disadvantageous mutants are predicted to exist, which has implications for the adaptive potential of the population in case of an environmental change. In panmictic populations, disadvantageous mutants can persist around a steady state, determined by the rate of mutant production and the selective disadvantage (selection-mutation balance). In a fragmented system that consists of demes connected by migration, a steady-state persistence of disadvantageous mutants is also observed, which, however, is fundamentally different from the mutation-selection balance and characterized by higher mutant levels. The increase in mutant frequencies above the selection-mutation balance can be maintained in small ( N<Nc ) demes as long as the migration rate is sufficiently small. The migration rate above which the mutants approach the selection-mutation balance decays exponentially with N\/Nc . The observed increase in the mutant numbers is not explained by the change in the effective population size. Implications for evolutionary processes in diseases are discussed, where the pre-existence of disadvantageous drug-resistant mutant cells or pathogens drives the response of the disease to treatments.","763":"To evaluate the association of the Lanzhou lamb rotavirus vaccination with RV-GE among children in southern China.This study provides evidence of the population health benefits of the Lanzhou lamb rotavirus vaccination in preventing RV-GE among children in China younger than 4 years, including herd effects.This cross-sectional, ecological study was set in Guangzhou, China. Participants were infants possibly vaccinated (aged 2 months to 3 years) and the children ineligible for vaccination (aged \u22654 years). The study was conducted from May 1, 2007, to April 30, 2016, and the data analysis was conducted in July 2016.Annual median age at onset of RV-GE and seasonal distribution of incidence. Cases of RV-GE in Guangzhou, China, diagnosed from May 1, 2007, to April 30, 2016, and reported to the National Information System for Disease Control and Prevention were examined. Poisson regression models were fitted among 32\u202f452 children younger than 4 years and among 450 children who had been ineligible for vaccination, while controlling for secular trends, socioeconomic status, and meteorological factors. Logistic regression was used to assess the indirect effects provided by the vaccinated infants from 2009 to 2011 on unvaccinated infants aged 2 to 35 months based on a separate case-control data set.Since 2000, the Lanzhou lamb rotavirus vaccine has been exclusively licensed in China for voluntary rotavirus gastroenteritis (RV-GE) prevention.During 9 seasons, 119\u202f705 patients with gastroenteritis were reported; 33\u202f407 were confirmed for RV-GE (21\u202f202 [63.5%] male, 32\u202f022 [95.8%] aged <4 years, and 31\u202f306 [93.8%] residing in urban districts). The median age at onset for all patients with RV-GE increased from 11 months during the 2007 season to 15 months during the 2015 season, and the onset, peak, and cessation of incidence were delayed. When citywide vaccination coverage in the prior 12 months was classified into high and low groups (\u22658.36% vs <8.36%), the incidence rate ratio for the high coverage group decreased by 32.4% among children younger than 4 years (incidence rate ratio, 0.676; 95% CI, 0.659-0.693; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Among the children ineligible for vaccination, the incidence rate ratio in higher coverage periods was 0.790 (95% CI, 0.351-0.915; P\u2009<\u2009.001) compared with the lower coverage. Compared with districts with 14% or less vaccination coverage, the adjusted odds ratio for RV-GE among unvaccinated children younger than 3 years was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.73-0.99; P\u2009=\u2009.03) for districts with 15% to 19% of coverage, and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.67-0.93; P\u2009=\u2009.004) for districts with more than 20% of coverage.","764":".

It is caused by a bacterial infection that leads to the inflammation of the air sacs in human lungs and potentially results in a lung abscess if not properly untreated. Here in this article we introduced a novel mathematical model to investigate the potential impact of Pneumonia treatments on disease transmission dynamics. The model is then validated against data from Jakarta City, Indonesia. In the model, the infection stage in infected individuals is categorized into three stages: the Exposed, Congestion and Hepatization, and the Resolution stage. Mathematical analysis shows that the disease-free equilibrium is always locally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction number is less than one and unstable when larger than one. The endemic equilibrium only exists when the basic reproduction number is larger than one. Our proposed model always exhibits a forward bifurcation when the basic reproduction number is equal to one, which indicates local stability of the endemic equilibrium when the basic reproduction number is larger than one but close to one. A global sensitivity analysis shows that the infection parameter is the most influential parameter in determining the size of the total infected individual in the endemic equilibrium point. Furthermore, we also found that the hospitalization and the acceleration of the treatment duration can be used to control the level of endemic size. An optimal control problem was constructed from the earlier model and analyzed using the Pontryagin Maximum Principle. We find that the implementation of treatment in the earlier stage of infected individuals is needed to avoid a more significant outbreak of Pneumonia in a long-term intervention.","766":"Utilizing machine learning algorithms, this study analyzed data from 819 children in the West Bank to investigate sociodemographic and health factors associated with food insecurity and its effects on nutritional status. The average age of the children was 33 months, with 52% boys and 48% girls.The analysis revealed that 18.1% of children faced food insecurity, with household education, family income, locality, district, and age emerging as significant determinants. Children from food-insecure environments exhibited lower average weight, height, and mid-upper arm circumference compared to their food-secure counterparts, indicating a direct correlation between food insecurity and reduced nutritional and growth metrics. Moreover, the machine learning models observed vitamin B1 as a key indicator of all forms of malnutrition, alongside vitamin K1, vitamin A, and zinc. Specific nutrients like choline in the \"underweight\" category and carbohydrates in the \"wasting\" category were identified as unique nutritional priorities.Food insecurity significantly impacts children's health, affecting their development across cognitive, physical, and socio-emotional dimensions. This study explores the impact of food insecurity among children aged 6 months to 5 years, focusing on nutrient intake and its relationship with various forms of malnutrition.This study provides insights into the differential risks for growth issues among children, offering valuable information for targeted interventions and policymaking.","767":"The understanding of immunological interactions among the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes and their epidemiological implications is often hampered by the lack of individual-level infection history. Using a statistical framework that infers full infection history, we analyze a prospective pediatric cohort in Nicaragua to characterize how infection history modulates the risks of DENV infection and subsequent clinical disease. After controlling for age, one prior infection is associated with 54% lower, while two or more are associated with 91% higher, risk of a new infection, compared to DENV-naive children. Children\u2009>8 years old have 55% and 120% higher risks of infection and subsequent disease, respectively, than their younger peers. Among children with\u2009\u22651 prior infection, intermediate antibody titers increase, whereas high titers lower, the risk of subsequent infection, compared with undetectable titers. Such complex dependency needs to be considered in the design of dengue vaccines and vaccination strategies.","768":"We used whole-genome sequencing to investigate a dual-genotype outbreak of measles occurring after the XXI Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver, Canada. By sequencing 27 complete genomes from H1 and D8 genotype measles viruses isolated from outbreak cases, we estimated the virus mutation rate, determined that person-to-person transmission is typically associated with 0 mutations between isolates, and established that a single introduction of H1 virus led to the expansion of the outbreak beyond Vancouver. This is the largest measles genomics project to date, revealing novel aspects of measles virus genetics and providing new insights into transmission of this reemerging viral pathogen. ","769":"We abstracted unintentional drug overdose deaths ( International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, codes X40-X44) with contributory drug-specific T codes (T36.0-T50.9) from the Mortality Multiple Cause Micro-Data Files. We assumed that the proportion of unspecified overdose deaths that might be attributed to opioids would be the same as the proportion of opioid-related overdose deaths among all overdose deaths and calculated the number of deaths that could be reallocated as opioid-related for each state and year. We then added these reallocated deaths to the reported deaths to determine their potential effect on total opioid-related deaths.A complete and accurate count of the number of opioid-related overdose deaths is essential to properly allocate resources. We determined the rate of unintentional overdose deaths (non-opioid-related, opioid-related, or unspecified) in the United States and by state from 1999 to 2015 and the possible effects of underreporting on national estimates of opioid abuse.From 1999 to 2015, a total of 438\u2009607 people died from unintentional drug overdoses. Opioid-related overdose deaths rose 401% (from 5868 to 29\u2009383), non-opioid-related overdose deaths rose 150% (from 3005 to 7505), and unspecified overdose deaths rose 220% (from 2255 to 29\u2009383). In 5 states (Alabama, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Pennsylvania), more than 35% of unintentional overdose deaths were coded as unspecified. Our reallocation resulted in classifying more than 70\u2009000 unspecified overdose deaths as potential additional opioid-related overdose deaths.States may be greatly underestimating the effect of opioid-related overdose deaths because of incomplete cause-of-death reporting, indicating that the current opioid overdose epidemic may be worse than it appears.","770":" reflects the dominance of the co-infecting strains, and that the ability of a mutant strain to invade a population is a function of its dominance in co-infections. To illustrate the utility of these concepts, we use a within-host model to show how dominance arises from the within-host dynamics of a co-infection, and then use an epidemiological model to demonstrate that dominance is a robust predictor of the ability of a mutant strain to save a maladapted wild-type strain from extinction (evolutionary emergence).","771":"The FRP by age group revealed the additional utility of the measure beyond the temporal and cross-sectional network connectivity measures. Other nonnetwork factors are still necessary to infer total epidemic potential for any specific pathogen.The overall mean and median paths were higher in San Francisco than in Atlanta. The overall paths for each city were greater than the sum of the paths in each individual partnership network. In the casual partnership network, the mean path was highest in the youngest age group and lowest in the oldest age group, despite the fact that the youngest group had the lowest mean momentary degree and past-year partner counts.We used temporal exponential random graph models to estimate the generative parameters for each city's dynamic sexual network from survey data. We then simulated stochastic dynamic networks from the fitted models and calculated the FRP for each realization, overall, and stratified by partnership type and demographics.The speed with which a pathogen circulates in a sexual network is a function of network connectivity. Cross-sectional connectivity is a function of network features like momentary degree and assortative mixing. Temporal connectivity is driven by partner acquisition rates. The forward-reachable path (FRP) has been proposed as a summary measure of these two aspects of transmission potential. We use empirical data from San Francisco and Atlanta to estimate the generative parameters of the FRP and compare results to the HIV\/sexually transmitted infection epidemics in each city.","772":"F-choline PET\/mpMRI for the detection of primary prostate cancer with a Gleason score of greater than or equal to 3 + 4 is cost-effective and can reduce the number of unneeded biopsies in comparison to mpMRI alone.","773":"To evaluate the association of neighborhood level economic, environmental, and social indicators with lung cancer (LC) incidence and mortality. Data for adult incident LC cases in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, diagnosed between 2015-2019 were obtained from Pennsylvania cancer registry. Cases were summarized at census-tract level. Publicly available data on neighborhood deprivation index (NDI), built environment, and racial isolation at census-tracts were linked to cases. Poisson regression was used to compute relative risk (RR) for LC incidence and mortality, adjusting for covariates. A total of 3256 LC cases were included in the analyses. About 68% were \u226565 years, 54% female, 14% Black or African American, and 63% deceased. Results of the multivariable model found that increasing quintiles (Q) of NDI were significantly associated with increasing risk of LC incidence and mortality. The RRs (95% confidence interval) of LC incidence for Q2, Q3, Q4 and Q5 were 1.36 (1.21-1.52), 1.55 (1.40-1.72), 1.68 (1.51-1.87), 2.08 (1.82-2.38), respectively, compared with Q1 (P trend <0.01). The corresponding RRs for LC mortality were 1.46 (1.27-1.68), 1.63 (1.42-1.88), 1.74 (1.51-2.01), 2.04 (2.02-2.88) (P trend <0.01).

In an ED without rMRI, we considered 3 strategies: clinical judgment, universal head computed tomography (CT), or Pittsburgh Infant Brain Injury Score (PIBIS) with CT. In an ED with rMRI for brain availability, we considered additional strategies: universal rMRI, universal rMRI with CT, PIBIS with rMRI, and PIBIS with rMRI followed by CT . Correct diagnosis eliminated future risk; missed AHT led to re-injury risk with associated poor outcomes. Cohorts were followed for one year from a healthcare perspective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Main outcomes evaluated in this study were AHT correctly identified and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year.By applying CT to a more targeted population, PIBIS decreases radiation exposure and is more effective for AHT identification compared with clinical judgment. When rMRI is available, universal rMRI with CT is more effective than PIBIS and is economically favorable.Without rMRI availability, PIBIS followed by CT was the most cost-effective strategy. Results were sensitive to variation of CT-induced cancer parameters and AHT prevalence. When rMRI was available, universal rMRI followed by confirmatory CT cost $25,791 to gain one additional quality-adjusted life-year compared with PIBIS followed by rMRI with confirmatory CT. In both models, clinical judgement was less effective than alternative strategies.","775":"Many blood donation services around the globe maintain large archives of serum and\/or plasma specimens of blood donations which could potentially be used for serologic surveillance and risk assessment of influenza.

We harvested EDTA-plasma specimens from the blood donation archives of Hong Kong Red Cross Transfusion Services, where EDTA is the type of anticoagulant used for plasma collection, compared their antibody titers and responses to that in serum.

Our results showed that antibody titers in 609 matched serum\/EDTA-plasma specimens (i.e. obtained from the same donor at the same time) had good agreement inferred by Intraclass Correlation Coefficient, the value of which was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.77-0.86) for hemagglutination inhibition assay and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93-0.96) for microneutralization assay; seroconversion rates (based on hemagglutination inhibition titers) during the 2010 and 2011 influenza seasons in Hong Kong inferred from paired EDTA-plasma were similar to that inferred from paired sera. Our study provided the proof-of-concept that blood donation archives could be leveraged as a valuable source of longitudinal blood specimens for the surveillance, control and risk assessment of both pandemic and seasonal influenza.","776":"A central goal of community ecology is to infer biotic interactions from observed distributions of co-occurring species. Evidence for biotic interactions, however, can be obscured by shared environmental requirements, posing a challenge for statistical inference. Here, we introduce a dynamic statistical model, based on probit regression, that quantifies the effects of spatial and temporal covariance in longitudinal co-occurrence data. We separate the fixed pairwise effects of species occurrences on persistence and colonization rates, a potential signal of direct interactions, from latent pairwise correlations in occurrence, a potential signal of shared environmental responses. We first validate our modeling framework with several simulation studies. Then, we apply the approach to a pressing epidemiological question by examining how human papillomavirus (HPV) types coexist. Our results suggest that while HPV types respond similarly to common host traits, direct interactions are sparse and weak, so that HPV type diversity depends largely on shared environmental drivers. Our modeling approach is widely applicable to microbial communities and provides valuable insights that should lead to more directed hypothesis testing and mechanistic modeling.","777":"Links in most real networks often change over time. Such temporality of links encodes the ordering and causality of interactions between nodes and has a profound effect on network dynamics and function. Empirical evidence has shown that the temporal nature of links in many real-world networks is not random. Nonetheless, it is challenging to predict temporal link patterns while considering the entanglement between topological and temporal link patterns. Here, we propose an entropy-rate-based framework, based on combined topological-temporal regularities, for quantifying the predictability of any temporal network. We apply our framework on various model networks, demonstrating that it indeed captures the intrinsic topological-temporal regularities whereas previous methods considered only temporal aspects. We also apply our framework on 18 real networks of different types and determine their predictability. Interestingly, we find that, for most real temporal networks, despite the greater complexity of predictability brought by the increase in dimension, the combined topological-temporal predictability is higher than the temporal predictability. Our results demonstrate the necessity for incorporating both temporal and topological aspects of networks in order to improve predictions of dynamical processes.","778":"Of the 1,356 patients hospitalized with LRTI, 101 (7.4%) died while hospitalized. The CURB-65, CRB-65, and CTA scores had poor calibration and demonstrated low discrimination with c-statistics of 0.594, 0.548, and 0.569 respectively. Significant risk factors for in-hospital mortality included age\u2009\u2265\u200945\u00a0years (A), confusion on admission (C), HIV-infection (H), and serum blood urea nitrogen >7\u00a0mmol\/L (U), which were used to create the seven-point ACHU clinical predictor score. In-hospital mortality, stratified by ACHU score was: score \u22641, 2.4%, score 2, 6.4%, score 3, 11.9%, and score\u2009\u2265\u20094, 29.3%. Final models showed good discrimination (c-statistic 0.789) and calibration (chi-square 1.6, Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit p-value\u2009=\u20090.904) and discriminated well in the bootstrap sample (average optimism of 0.003).We analyzed 1,356 LRTI hospitalizations in adults aged \u226518\u00a0years enrolled in Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) surveillance in three South African hospitals from January 2010 to December 2011. Using demographic and clinical data at admission, we evaluated potential risk factors for in-hospital mortality. We evaluated three existing respiratory severity scores, CURB-65, CRB-65, and Classification Tree Analysis (CTA) Score assessing for discrimination and calibration. We then developed a new respiratory severity score using a multivariable logistic regression model for in-hospital mortality and assigned points to risk factors based on the coefficients in the multivariable model. Finally we evaluated the model statistically using bootstrap resampling techniques.Acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are a frequent cause of hospitalization and mortality in South Africa; however, existing respiratory severity scores may underestimate mortality risk in HIV-infected adults in resource limited settings. A simple predictive clinical score for low-resource settings could aid healthcare providers in the management of patients hospitalized with LRTI.Existing clinical predictive scores underestimated mortality in a low resource setting with a high HIV burden. The ACHU score incorporates a simple set a risk factors that can accurately stratify patients \u226518\u00a0years of age with LRTI by in-hospital mortality risk. This score can quantify in-hospital mortality risk in an HIV-endemic, resource-limited setting with limited clinical information and if used to facilitate timely treatment may improve clinical outcomes.","779":"To prospectively chart pathways of risk and resiliency following childhood trauma studies need to address three limitations of prior work: 1) recruit beyond social service\/ treatment settings; 2) include broad spectrum of trauma types and 3) cast a broad longitudinal measurement framework of both clinical diagnoses and traumatic exposures. The Texas-Childhood Trauma Research Network (TX-CTRN) is a multi-site collaboration that addresses these limitations. In this baseline-only report, we examined domains of trauma and evaluated the concurrent predictive validity of various traumatic event scoring schemas for clinical diagnoses.Broad-base recruitment of 8-20\u202fyear-olds (N\u202f=\u202f1289) included trauma centers, emergency departments, pediatric and primary care clinics, and other community settings. Assessments were comprehensive and based on clinical interviews by trained research interviewers.Factor analyses supported a five-factor solution of trauma domains including unintentional\/acute, intentional\/interpersonal, bullying, in-home versus community witnessed interpersonal harms. Trauma burden scoring schemas were examined for their predictive superiority. Domain-specific counts of traumas that met DSM-5 post-traumatic-stress disorder (PTSD) Criterion-A was the best overall schema in distinguishing among youth with no diagnosis, comorbidities, those with depression, suicidality, substance misuse, and PTSD.There were no assessments of neglect.Findings largely aligned with earlier studies on the relative importance of intentional interpersonal traumas and showed bullying may be an important source of traumatic stress that independently adds to prediction of several diagnoses and should be considered in clinical practice.","780":"Several important aspects related to SARS-CoV-2 transmission are not well known due to a lack of appropriate data. However, mathematical and computational tools can be used to extract part of this information from the available data, like some hidden age-related characteristics. In this paper, we present a method to investigate age-specific differences in transmission parameters related to susceptibility to and infectiousness upon contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. More specifically, we use panel-based social contact data from diary-based surveys conducted in Belgium combined with the next generation principle to infer the relative incidence and we compare this to real-life incidence data. Comparing these two allows for the estimation of age-specific transmission parameters. Our analysis implies the susceptibility in children to be around half of the susceptibility in adults, and even lower for very young children (preschooler). However, the probability of adults and the elderly to contract the infection is decreasing throughout the vaccination campaign, thereby modifying the picture over time.","781":"Maps of malaria risk are important tools for allocating resources and tracking progress. Most maps rely on cross-sectional surveys of parasite prevalence, but health facilities represent an underused and powerful data source. We aimed to model and map malaria incidence using health facility data in Uganda.Using 24 months (2019-2020) of individual-level outpatient data collected from 74 surveillance health facilities located in 41 districts across Uganda (n=445\u2009648 laboratory-confirmed cases), we estimated monthly malaria incidence for parishes within facility catchment areas (n=310) by estimating care-seeking population denominators. We fit spatio-temporal models to the incidence estimates to predict incidence rates for the rest of Uganda, informed by environmental, sociodemographic and intervention variables. We mapped estimated malaria incidence and its uncertainty at the parish level and compared estimates to other metrics of malaria. To quantify the impact that indoor residual spraying (IRS) may have had, we modelled counterfactual scenarios of malaria incidence in the absence of IRS.Over 4567 parish-months, malaria incidence averaged 705 cases per 1000 person-years. Maps indicated high burden in the north and northeast of Uganda, with lower incidence in the districts receiving IRS. District-level estimates of cases correlated with cases reported by the Ministry of Health (Spearman's r=0.68, p<0.0001), but were considerably higher (40 166 418 cases estimated compared with 27 707 794 cases reported), indicating the potential for underreporting by the routine surveillance system. Modelling of counterfactual scenarios suggest that approximately 6.2\u2009million cases were averted due to IRS across the study period in the 14 districts receiving IRS (estimated population 8 381 223).Outpatient information routinely collected by health systems can be a valuable source of data for mapping malaria burden. National Malaria Control Programmes may consider investing in robust surveillance systems within public health facilities as a low-cost, high benefit tool to identify vulnerable regions and track the impact of interventions.","782":", time to peak infection) were more sensitive to changes in information than others (epidemic extent). These findings suggest that insights gained from transmission modeling using dynamic contact data can be influenced by processing decisions alone, emphasizing the need to carefully consideration them prior to using contact-based models to conduct analyses, compare different datasets, or inform policy decisions.","783":"Purpose\r\nThis paper aims to determine current views of educators and practitioners regarding forensic accounting education, given the recent dramatic growth in the number of colleges and universities offering such education.\r\n\r\nDesign\/methodology\/approach\r\nSurvey, with statistical analysis of responses.\r\n\r\nFindings\r\nResults find that while both groups agree the demand for forensic accounting services will increase in the near future and that they prefer a separate course or degree be offered at the graduate and undergraduate levels, there are several significant differences between the educators\u0092 and practitioners\u0092 opinions on forensic accounting content and preferred teaching techniques.

Serological surveys, which provide direct measures of population protection against the infection, are underexploited and often supply fragmentary estimates of population immunity. This study aims to investigate how measles immunity has changed over time across different socioeconomic settings, as a result of demographic changes and past immunisation policies.Our model shows that estimated residual susceptibility to measles ranges from 3% in the UK to more than 10% in Kenya and Ethiopia. In high-income countries, such as Italy, Singapore, and South Korea, where routine first-dose administration produced more than 90% of immunised individuals, only about 20% of susceptible individuals are younger than 5 years. We also observed that the reduction in fertility that has occurred during the past decades in high-income countries has contributed to almost half of the reduction in measles incidence. In low-income countries, where fertility is high, the population is younger and routine vaccination has been suboptimum. Susceptible individuals are concentrated in early childhood, with about 60% of susceptible individuals in Ethiopia younger than 10 years. In these countries, Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) were responsible for more than 25% of immunised individuals (up to 45% in Ethiopia), mitigating the consequences of suboptimum routine vaccination coverage.For this multi-country modelling analysis, we developed a transmission model to simulate measles circulation during the past 65 years in nine countries with distinct demographic and vaccination histories. The model was calibrated on historical serological data and used to estimate the reduction of disease burden as a result of vaccination and present age-specific residual susceptibility.Future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunisation rates, either by raising first-dose coverage or by making erratic SIAs more frequent and regular. Immunisation campaigns targeting adolescents and adults are required in low-fertility countries, where the susceptibility in these age groups will otherwise sustain measles circulation.European Research Council.","785":"A surge of interest has been noted in the use of mobility data from mobile phones to monitor physical distancing and model the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Despite several years of research in this area, standard frameworks for aggregating and making use of different data streams from mobile phones are scarce and difficult to generalise across data providers. Here, we examine aggregation principles and procedures for different mobile phone data streams and describe a common syntax for how aggregated data are used in research and policy. We argue that the principles of privacy and data protection are vital in assessing more technical aspects of aggregation and should be an important central feature to guide partnerships with governments who make use of research products.","786":"If mortality benefits can be empirically verified, our results provide support for expanding bedaquiline access to all patients with MDR TB. Such expansion could improve patients' health, protect background MDR TB drugs, and decrease transmission, but would likely result in greater resistance to bedaquiline.We created a Markov decision model to follow a hypothetical cohort of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB patients under different bedaquiline use strategies. The explored strategies included making bedaquiline available to all patients with MDR TB, restricting bedaquiline usage to patients with MDR plus additional resistance and withholding bedaquiline introduction completely. We compared these strategies according to life expectancy, risks of acquired resistance, and the expected number and health outcomes of secondary cases. For our simulated cohort, the mean (2.5th, 97.5th percentile) life expectancy from time of initiation of MDR TB treatment at age 30 was 36.0 y (33.5, 38.7) assuming all patients with MDR TB received bedaquiline, 35.1 y (34.4, 35.8) assuming patients with pre-extensively drug-resistant (PreXDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB received bedaquiline, and 34.9 y (34.6, 35.2) assuming only patients with XDR TB received bedaquiline. Although providing bedaquiline to all MDR patients resulted in the highest life expectancy for our initial cohort averaged across all parameter sets, for parameter sets in which bedaquiline conferred high risks of added mortality and only small reductions in median time to culture conversion, the optimal strategy would be to withhold use even from patients with the most extensive resistance. Across all parameter sets, the most liberal bedaquiline use strategies consistently increased the risk of bedaquiline resistance but decreased the risk of resistance to other MDR drugs. In almost all cases, more liberal bedaquiline use strategies reduced the expected number of secondary cases and resulting life years lost. The generalizability of our results is limited by the lack of available data about drug effects among individuals with HIV co-infection, drug interactions, and other sources of heterogeneity, as well as changing recommendations for MDR TB treatment.New drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) are becoming available for the first time in over 40 y. Optimal strategies for introducing these drugs have not yet been established. The objective of this study was to compare different strategies for introducing the new TB drug bedaquiline based on patients' resistance patterns.","787":"Faeces-mediated transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi (the aetiological agent of Chagas disease) by triatomine insects is extremely inefficient. Still, the parasite emerges frequently, and has infected millions of people and domestic animals. We synthesize here the results of field and laboratory studies of T. cruzi transmission conducted in and around Arequipa, Peru. We document the repeated occurrence of large colonies of triatomine bugs (more than 1000) with very high infection prevalence (more than 85%). By inoculating guinea pigs, an important reservoir of T. cruzi in Peru, and feeding triatomine bugs on them weekly, we demonstrate that, while most animals quickly control parasitaemia, a subset of animals remains highly infectious to vectors for many months. However, we argue that the presence of these persistently infectious hosts is insufficient to explain the observed prevalence of T. cruzi in vector colonies. We posit that seasonal rains, leading to a fluctuation in the price of guinea pig food (alfalfa), leading to annual guinea pig roasts, leading to a concentration of vectors on a small subpopulation of animals maintained for reproduction, can propel T. cruzi through vector colonies and create a considerable force of infection for a pathogen whose transmission might otherwise fizzle out. ","788":"During the 2009 influenza pandemic, uncertainty surrounding the severity of human infections with the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus hindered the calibration of the early public health response. The case fatality risk was widely used to assess severity, but another underexplored and potentially more immediate measure is the hospitalization fatality risk (HFR), defined as the probability of death among H1N1pdm09 cases who required hospitalization for medical reasons. In this review, we searched for relevant studies published in MEDLINE (PubMed) and EMBASE between April 1, 2009, and January 9, 2014. Crude estimates of the HFR ranged from 0% to 52%, with higher estimates from tertiary-care referral hospitals in countries with a lower gross domestic product, but in wealthy countries the estimate was 1%-3% in all settings. Point estimates increased substantially with age and with lower gross domestic product. Early in the next pandemic, estimation of a standardized HFR may provide a picture of the severity of infection, particularly if it is presented in comparison with a similarly standardized HFR for seasonal influenza in the same setting. ","789":"The Director-General of the World Health Organization has called for global action towards elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem. Cervical cancer is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), an infectious agent with no non-human reservoir. One way to achieve this is through very high levels of vaccine coverage that could enable global eradication of vaccine-type HPV. Using the case study of India, we show that HPV eradication can meet all the Dahlem and Str\u00fcngmann criteria for feasibility of eradication. It can be achieved with 90% gender-neutral HPV vaccine coverage together with 95% coverage in high-risk groups such as female sex workers. Such a strategy would likely be cost-effective compared to no vaccination. Although it would be more costly in the short-term than achieving cervical cancer elimination alone, it would save costs in the long-term by removing or at least sharply reducing the need for preventive measures.","790":"To investigate if tweets with different sentiments toward vaccination and different contents attract different levels of Twitter users' engagement (retweets).A stratified random sample (N = 1425) of 142,891 #vaccine tweets (February 4, 2010, to November 10, 2016) was manually coded. All 201 tweets with 100 or more retweets from 194,259 #vaccineswork tweets (January 1, 2014, to April 30, 2015) were manually coded. Regression models were applied to identify factors associated with retweet frequency.Among #vaccine tweets, provaccine tweets (adjusted prevalence ratio = 1.5836, 95% confidence interval = 1.2130-2.0713, p < 0.001) and antivaccine tweets (adjusted prevalence ratio = 4.1280, 95% confidence interval = 3.1183-5.4901, p < 0.001) had more retweets than neutral tweets. No significant differences occurred in retweet frequency for content categories among antivaccine tweets. Among 411 links in provaccine tweets, Twitter (53; 12.9%), content curator Trap.it (14; 3.4%), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (8; 1.9%) ranked as the top 3 domains. Among 325 links in antivaccine tweets, social media links were common: Twitter (44; 14.9%), YouTube (25; 8.4%), and Facebook (10; 3.4%). Among highly retweeted #vaccineswork tweets, the most common theme was childhood vaccinations (40%; 81\/201); 21% mentioned global vaccination improvement\/efforts (42\/201); 29% mentioned vaccines can prevent outbreaks and deaths (58\/201).Engaging social media key opinion leaders to facilitate health education about vaccination in their tweets may allow reaching a wider audience online.Social media platforms are important channels through which health education about the utility and safety of vaccination is conducted.","791":"Both the American College of Gastroenterology and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) \/ Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of American 2021 Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) guidelines recommend fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for persons with multiple recurrent CDI. Emerging data suggest that FMT may have high cure rates when used for first recurrent CDI. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of FMT for first recurrent CDI.We developed a Markov model to simulate a cohort of patients presenting with initial CDI infection. The model estimated the costs, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of different CDI treatment regimens recommended in the 2021 IDSA guidelines, with the additional option of FMT for first recurrent CDI. The model includes stratification by the severity of initial infection, estimates of cure, recurrence, and mortality. Data sources were taken from IDSA guidelines and published literature on treatment outcomes. Outcome measures were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).FMT is a cost-effective strategy for first recurrent CDI. Prospective evaluation of FMT for first recurrent CDI is warranted to determine the efficacy and risk of recurrence.When FMT is available for first recurrent CDI, the optimal cost-effective treatment strategy is fidaxomicin for initial non-severe CDI, Vancomycin for initial severe CDI, and FMT for first and subsequent recurrent CDI, with an ICER of $27,135\/QALY. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis at a $100,000 cost-effectiveness threshold, FMT for first and subsequent CDI recurrence was cost-effective 90% of the time given parameter uncertainty.","792":"The health and safety of incarcerated persons and correctional personnel have been prominent in the U.S. news media discourse during the COVID-19 pandemic. Examining changing attitudes toward the health of the incarcerated population is imperative to better assess the extent to which the general public favors criminal justice reform. However, existing natural language processing lexicons that underlie current sentiment analysis (SA) algorithms may not perform adequately on news articles related to criminal justice due to contextual complexities. News discourse during the pandemic has highlighted the need for a novel SA lexicon and algorithm (i.e., an SA package) tailored for examining public health policy in the context of the criminal justice system. We analyzed the performance of existing SA packages on a corpus of news articles at the intersection of COVID-19 and criminal justice collected from state-level outlets between January and May 2020. Our results demonstrated that sentence sentiment scores provided by three popular SA packages can differ considerably from manually-curated ratings. This dissimilarity was especially pronounced when the text was more polarized, whether negatively or positively. A randomly selected set of 1,000 manually scored sentences, and the corresponding binary document term matrices, were used to train two new sentiment prediction algorithms (i.e., linear regression and random forest regression) to verify the performance of the manually-curated ratings. By better accounting for the unique context in which incarceration-related terminologies are used in news media, both of our proposed models outperformed all existing SA packages considered for comparison. Our findings suggest that there is a need to develop a novel lexicon, and potentially an accompanying algorithm, for analysis of text related to public health within the criminal justice system, as well as criminal justice more broadly.","793":"Passively-generated data, such as GPS data and cellular data, bring tremendous opportunities for human mobility analysis and transportation applications. Since their primary purposes are often non-transportation related, the passively-generated data need to be processed to extract trips. Most existing trip extraction methods rely on data that are generated via a single positioning technology such as GPS or triangulation through cellular towers (thereby called single-sourced data), and methods to extract trips from data generated via multiple positioning technologies (or, multi-sourced data) are absent. And yet, multi-sourced data are now increasingly common. Generated using multiple technologies (e.g., GPS, cellular network- and WiFi-based), multi-sourced data contain high variances in their temporal and spatial properties. In this study, we propose a \"Divide, Conquer and Integrate\" (DCI) framework to extract trips from multi-sourced data. We evaluate the proposed framework by applying it to an app-based data, which is multi-sourced and has high variances in both location accuracy and observation interval (i.e. time interval between two consecutive observations). On a manually labeled sample of the app-based data, the framework outperforms the state-of-the-art SVM model that is designed for GPS data. The effectiveness of the framework is also illustrated by consistent mobility patterns obtained from the app-based data and an externally collected household travel survey data for the same region and the same period.","794":"Implementing an XDRO registry reduced CRE spread, even when only 25% of the largest Illinois facilities participated due to patient sharing. Non-participating facilities garnered benefits, with reductions in new carriers.We developed an agent-based model of all inpatient healthcare facilities (90 acute care hospitals, 9 long-term acute care hospitals, 351 skilled nursing facilities, and 12 ventilator-capable skilled nursing facilities) in the Chicago metropolitan area, surrounding communities, and patient flow using our Regional Healthcare Ecosystem Analyst software platform. Scenarios explored the impact of a registry that tracked patients carrying CRE to help guide infection prevention and control.When all Illinois facilities participated (n=402), the registry reduced the number of new carriers by 11.7% and CRE prevalence by 7.6% over a 3-year period. When 75% of the largest Illinois facilities participated (n=304), registry use resulted in a 11.6% relative reduction in new carriers (16.9% and 1.2% in participating and non-participating facilities, respectively) and 5.0% relative reduction in prevalence. When 50% participated (n=201), there were 10.7% and 5.6% relative reductions in incident carriers and prevalence, respectively. When 25% participated (n=101), there was a 9.1% relative reduction in incident carriers (20.4% and 1.6% in participating and non-participating facilities, respectively) and 2.8% relative reduction in prevalence.Regions are considering the use of electronic registries to track patients that carry antibiotic-resistant bacteria including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Implementing such a registry can be challenging and requires time, effort, and resources; therefore, there is a need to better understand the potential impact.","795":"Sexual transmission of Ebola virus disease (EVD) 6 months after onset of symptoms has been recently documented, and Ebola virus RNA has been detected in semen of survivors up to 9 months after onset of symptoms. As countries affected by the 2013-2015 epidemic in West Africa, by far the largest to date, are declared free of Ebola virus disease (EVD), it remains unclear what threat is posed by rare sexual transmission events that could arise from survivors.We devised a compartmental mathematical model that includes sexual transmission from convalescent survivors: a SEICR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-convalescent-recovered) transmission model. We fitted the model to weekly incidence of EVD cases from the 2014-2015 epidemic in Sierra Leone. Sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations showed that a 0.1% per sex act transmission probability and a 3-month convalescent period (the two key unknown parameters of sexual transmission) create very few additional cases, but would extend the epidemic by 83 days [95% CI: 68-98 days] (p < 0.0001) on average. Strikingly, a 6-month convalescent period extended the average epidemic by 540 days (95% CI: 508-572 days), doubling the current length, despite an insignificant rise in the number of new cases generated.Our results show that reductions in the per sex act transmission probability via abstinence and condom use should reduce the number of sporadic sexual transmission events, but will not significantly reduce the epidemic size and may only minimally shorten the length of time the public health community must maintain response preparedness. While the number of infectious survivors is expected to greatly decline over the coming months, our results show that transmission events may still be expected for quite some time as each event results in a new potential cluster of non-sexual transmission. Precise measurement of the convalescent period is thus important for planning ongoing surveillance efforts.","796":"Seasonal influenza infects between 10 and 50 million people in the United States every year. Accurate forecasts of influenza and influenza-like illness (ILI) have been named by the CDC as an important tool to fight the damaging effects of these epidemics. Multi-model ensembles make accurate forecasts of seasonal influenza, but current operational ensemble forecasts are static: they require an abundance of past ILI data and assign fixed weights to component models at the beginning of a season, but do not update weights as new data on component model performance is collected. We propose an adaptive ensemble that (i) does not initially need data to combine forecasts and (ii) finds optimal weights which are updated week-by-week throughout the influenza season. We take a regularized likelihood approach and investigate this regularizer's ability to impact adaptive ensemble performance. After finding an optimal regularization value, we compare our adaptive ensemble to an equal-weighted and static ensemble. Applied to forecasts of short-term ILI incidence at the regional and national level, our adaptive model outperforms an equal-weighted ensemble and has similar performance to the static ensemble using only a fraction of the data available to the static ensemble. Needing no data at the beginning of an epidemic, an adaptive ensemble can quickly train and forecast an outbreak, providing a practical tool to public health officials looking for a forecast to conform to unique features of a specific season.","797":"Solid estimates describing the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infections are still lacking due to under-ascertainment of asymptomatic and mild-disease cases. In this work, we quantify age-specific probabilities of transitions between stages defining the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection from 1965 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals identified in Italy between March and April 2020 among contacts of confirmed cases. Infected contacts of cases were confirmed via RT-PCR tests as part of contact tracing activities or retrospectively via IgG serological tests and followed-up for symptoms and clinical outcomes. In addition, we provide estimates of time intervals between key events defining the clinical progression of cases as obtained from a larger sample, consisting of 95,371 infections ascertained between February and July 2020.

The corresponding proportions in individuals younger than 60 years were estimated at 27.9% (95%CI: 25.4-30.4%), 8.8% (95%CI: 7.3-10.5%) and 0.4% (95%CI: 0.1-0.9%), respectively. The infection fatality ratio (IFR) ranged from 0.2% (95%CI: 0.0-0.6%) in individuals younger than 60 years to 12.3% (95%CI: 6.9-19.7%) for those aged 80 years or more; the case fatality ratio (CFR) in these two age classes was 0.6% (95%CI: 0.1-2%) and 19.2% (95%CI: 10.9-30.1%), respectively. The median length of stay in hospital was 10 (IQR: 3-21) days; the length of stay in ICU was 11 (IQR: 6-19) days.

(4) The labeled sentences served as training data to create machine learning models for classifying text; specifically, we used spaCy's default text classification ensemble, comprising a bag-of-words model and a neural network with attention. (5) We applied each model to unlabeled sentences to identify additional references to SRH with novel relevant vocabulary. We used this information and repeated steps 3-5 iteratively until the models identified no new relevant sentences for each topic. Finally, we aggregated the labeled data for analysis.To enable clinical researchers without expertise in natural language processing to extract and analyze information about sexual and reproductive health (SRH), or other sensitive health topics, from large sets of clinical notes.This methodology was applied to 3663 Child Neurology notes for 971 female patients. Our search focused on six SRH categories. We validated the approach using two subject matter experts, who independently labeled a sample of 400 sentences. Cohen's kappa values were calculated for each category between the reviewers (menstruation: 1, sexual activity: 0.9499, contraception: 0.9887, folic acid: 1, teratogens: 0.8864, pregnancy: 0.9499). After removing the sentences on which reviewers did not agree, we compared the reviewers' labels to those produced via our methodology, again using Cohen's kappa (menstruation: 1, sexual activity: 1, contraception: 0.9885, folic acid: 1, teratogens: 0.9841, pregnancy: 0.9871).Our methodology is reproducible, enables analysis of large amounts of text, and has produced results that are highly comparable to subject matter expert manual review.","800":"The spread of SARS-CoV-2, like that of many other pathogens, is governed by heterogeneity. \"Superspreading,\" or \"over-dispersion,\" is an important factor in transmission, yet it is hard to quantify. Estimates from contact tracing data are prone to potential biases due to the increased likelihood of detecting large clusters of cases, and may reflect variation in contact behavior more than biological heterogeneity. In contrast, the average number of secondary infections per contact is routinely estimated from household surveys, and these studies can minimize biases by testing all members of a household. However, the models used to analyze household transmission data typically assume that infectiousness and susceptibility are the same for all individuals or vary only with predetermined traits such as age. Here we develop and apply a combined forward simulation and inference method to quantify the degree of inter-individual variation in both infectiousness and susceptibility from observations of the distribution of infections in household surveys. First, analyzing simulated data, we show our method can reliably ascertain the presence, type, and amount of these heterogeneities given data from a sufficiently large sample of households. We then analyze a collection of household studies of COVID-19 from diverse settings around the world, and find strong evidence for large heterogeneity in both the infectiousness and susceptibility of individuals. Our results also provide a framework to improve the design of studies to evaluate household interventions in the presence of realistic heterogeneity between individuals.","801":"Microvascular perfusion dynamics are vital to physiological function and are frequently dysregulated in injury and disease. Typically studies measure microvascular flow in a few selected vascular segments over limited time, failing to capture spatial and temporal variability. To quantify microvascular flow in a more complete and unbiased way we developed STAFF (Spatial Temporal Analysis of Fieldwise Flow), a macro for FIJI open-source image analysis software. Using high-speed microvascular flow movies, STAFF generates kymographs for every time interval for every vascular segment, calculates flow velocities from red blood cell shadow angles, and outputs the data as color-coded velocity map movies and spreadsheets. In untreated mice, analyses demonstrated profound variation even between adjacent sinusoids over seconds. In acetaminophen-treated mice we detected flow reduction localized to pericentral regions. STAFF is a powerful new tool capable of providing novel insights by enabling measurement of the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of microvascular flow.","802":"The transmission of avian influenza between humans is extremely rare, and it mostly affects individuals who are in contact with infected family member. Although this scenario is uncommon, there have been multiple outbreaks that occur in small infection clusters in Asia with relatively lowtransmissibility, and thus are too weak to cause an epidemic. Still, subcritical transmission from stut-tering chain data is vital for determining whether avian influenza is close to the threshold of \u211c\u2080 > 1.In this article, we will explore two methods of estimating \u211c\u2080 using transmission chains and parameterestimation through data fitting. We found that \u211c\u2080 = 0.2205 when calculating the \u211c\u2080 using the maxi-mum likelihood method. When we computed the reproduction number for human to human transmis-sion through differential equations and fitted the model to data from the cumulative cases, cumulativedeaths, and cumulative secondary cases, we estimated \u211c\u2080 = 0.1768. To avoid violating the assumptionof the least square method, we fitted the model to incidence data to obtain \u211c\u2080 = 0.1520. We tested thestructural and practical identifiability of the model, and concluded that the model is identifiable undercertain assumptions. We further use two more methods to estimate \u211c\u2080 : by the \u211c\u2080 definition whichgives an overestimate of 0.28 and by Ferguson approach which yields \u211c\u2080 = 0.1586. We conclude that \u211c\u2080 for human to human transmission was about 0.2.","803":"Gridded population sampling is a promising alternative to typical census-based sampling when census data are moderately outdated or inaccurate. Four approaches to implementation have been tried: (1) using gridded PSU boundaries produced by GridSample, (2) manually segmenting gridded PSU using satellite imagery, (3) non-probability sampling (e.g. random-walk, \"spin-the-pen\"), and random sampling of households. Gridded population sampling is in its infancy, and further research is needed to assess the accuracy and feasibility of gridded population sampling. The GridSample R algorithm can be used to forward this research agenda.We replicated the 2010 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in GridSample by sampling the WorldPop 2010 UN-adjusted 100\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100\u00a0m gridded population dataset, stratifying by Rwanda's 30 districts, and oversampling in urban areas. The 2010 Rwanda DHS had 79 urban PSUs, 413 rural PSUs, with an average PSU population of 610 people. An equivalent sample in GridSample had 75 urban PSUs, 405 rural PSUs, and a median PSU population of 612 people. The number of PSUs differed because DHS added urban PSUs from specific districts while GridSample reallocated rural-to-urban PSUs across all districts.Household survey data are collected by governments, international organizations, and companies to prioritize policies and allocate billions of dollars. Surveys are typically selected from recent census data; however, census data are often outdated or inaccurate. This paper describes how gridded population data might instead be used as a sample frame, and introduces the R GridSample algorithm for selecting primary sampling units (PSU) for complex household surveys with gridded population data. With a gridded population dataset and geographic boundary of the study area, GridSample allows a two-step process to sample \"seed\" cells with probability proportionate to estimated population size, then \"grows\" PSUs until a minimum population is achieved in each PSU. The algorithm permits stratification and oversampling of urban or rural areas. The approximately uniform size and shape of grid cells allows for spatial oversampling, not possible in typical surveys, possibly improving small area estimates with survey results.","804":"Heterogeneity in different genomic studies compromises the performance of machine learning models in cross-study phenotype predictions. Overcoming heterogeneity when incorporating different studies in terms of phenotype prediction is a challenging and critical step for developing machine learning algorithms with reproducible prediction performance on independent datasets. We investigated the best approaches to integrate different studies of the same type of omics data under a variety of different heterogeneities. We developed a comprehensive workflow to simulate a variety of different types of heterogeneity and evaluate the performances of different integration methods together with batch normalization by using ComBat. We also demonstrated the results through realistic applications on six colorectal cancer (CRC) metagenomic studies and six tuberculosis (TB) gene expression studies, respectively. We showed that heterogeneity in different genomic studies can markedly negatively impact the machine learning classifier's reproducibility. ComBat normalization improved the prediction performance of machine learning classifier when heterogeneous populations are present, and could successfully remove batch effects within the same population. We also showed that the machine learning classifier's prediction accuracy can be markedly decreased as the underlying disease model became more different in training and test populations. Comparing different merging and integration methods, we found that merging and integration methods can outperform each other in different scenarios. In the realistic applications, we observed that the prediction accuracy improved when applying ComBat normalization with merging or integration methods in both CRC and TB studies. We illustrated that batch normalization is essential for mitigating both population differences of different studies and batch effects. We also showed that both merging strategy and integration methods can achieve good performances when combined with batch normalization. In addition, we explored the potential of boosting phenotype prediction performance by rank aggregation methods and showed that rank aggregation methods had similar performance as other ensemble learning approaches.","805":"Fluorescent powders are one of the most common external markers used to study mosquito behavior and ecology. For their reliable and practical use, it is important to evaluate their effect on biological parameters such as survival, blood-feeding, and mobility. We evaluated the effect of five different fluorescent powders (Day-Glo \u00ae ECO Series) on the survival of different age cohorts, blood-feeding success, and tethered flight speed on Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) adult females. For survival analysis, three cohorts (2-5, 6-9 and 10-13 days old) were marked and mortality recorded until all died. To examine the effect of fluorescent powders on female response to blood-feeding, the proportions of unfed, partially fed, and fully engorged females, after being exposed to host blood under two different time sets (20 and 40 min.), were compared. Their impact on female tethered flight speed was evaluated recording their flight for 30 min. with a flight mill. Survival distributions between treatments were not significantly different within each cohort. Blood-feeding was not significantly different among marked or unmarked females at both times of blood exposure, with the exception of Signal Green-ECO 18 and Ultra Violet- ECO 20 (at 20 and 40 min.), in which a higher proportion of partially fed females was observed compared to control females. In relation to flight performance, no statistically significant difference in mean tethered flight speed (m\/s), among marked and unmarked mosquito groups, was observed. Our results indicate that the tested powders and application method have few significant impacts on Ae. aegypti survival, blood-feeding success and flight performance, and are thus suitable for investigations of mosquito biology in the environment.","806":"The response to respiratory viruses varies substantially between individuals, and there are currently no known molecular predictors from the early stages of infection. Here we conduct a community-based analysis to determine whether pre- or early post-exposure molecular factors could predict physiologic responses to viral exposure. Using peripheral blood gene expression profiles collected from healthy subjects prior to exposure to one of four respiratory viruses (H1N1, H3N2, Rhinovirus, and RSV), as well as up to 24\u2009h following exposure, we find that it is possible to construct models predictive of symptomatic response using profiles even prior to viral exposure. Analysis of predictive gene features reveal little overlap among models; however, in aggregate, these genes are enriched for common pathways. Heme metabolism, the most significantly enriched pathway, is associated with a\u00a0higher risk of developing symptoms following viral exposure. This study demonstrates that pre-exposure molecular predictors can be identified and improves our understanding of the mechanisms of response to respiratory viruses.","807":"Using a geospatial model created for optimizing VL utilization in Zambia, we estimated the short-term cost of uptake\/correct VL result using either DBSs or PSCs to increase VL access on equipment available in-country. Five scenarios were modeled: (1) plasma only (status quo); (2) plasma at high-volume sites, DBS at low-volume sites; (3) plasma at high-volume sites, PSC at low-volume sites; (4) PSC only; (5) DBS only.Scenario 1 resulted in 795 342 correct results due to limited patient access. When allowing for full and partial adoption of dried specimens, access increases by 19%, with scenario 3 producing the greatest number of correct results expected (929 857). The average cost per correct VL result was lowest in the plasma + DBS scenario at $30.90 compared to $31.62 in our plasma + PSC scenario. The cost per correct result of using dried specimens only was dominated in the incremental analysis, due primarily to fewer correct results.Routine plasma viral load (VL) testing is recommended for monitoring human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy. In Zambia, VL scale-up is limited due to logistical obstacles around plasma specimen collection, storage, and transport to centralized laboratories. Dried blood spots (DBSs) could circumvent many logistical challenges at the cost of increased misclassification. Recently, plasma separation cards (PSCs) have become available and, though more expensive, have lower total misclassification than DBSs.Adopting the partial use of dried specimens will help achieve improved VL access for patients at the lowest cost per correct result.","808":" Treating children with Grades I, II, and III VUR with long-term antimicrobial prophylaxis costs substantially more than interventions typically considered economically reasonable. Prophylaxis in children with Grade IV VUR is cost effective.","809":"We often seek to estimate the impact of an exposure naturally occurring or randomly assigned at the cluster-level. For example, the literature on neighborhood determinants of health continues to grow. Likewise, community randomized trials are applied to learn about real-world implementation, sustainability, and population effects of interventions with proven individual-level efficacy. In these settings, individual-level outcomes are correlated due to shared cluster-level factors, including the exposure, as well as social or biological interactions between individuals. To flexibly and efficiently estimate the effect of a cluster-level exposure, we present two targeted maximum likelihood estimators (TMLEs). The first TMLE is developed under a non-parametric causal model, which allows for arbitrary interactions between individuals within a cluster. These interactions include direct transmission of the outcome (i.e. contagion) and influence of one individual's covariates on another's outcome (i.e. covariate interference). The second TMLE is developed under a causal sub-model assuming the cluster-level and individual-specific covariates are sufficient to control for confounding. Simulations compare the alternative estimators and illustrate the potential gains from pairing individual-level risk factors and outcomes during estimation, while avoiding unwarranted assumptions. Our results suggest that estimation under the sub-model can result in bias and misleading inference in an observational setting. Incorporating working assumptions during estimation is more robust than assuming they hold in the underlying causal model. We illustrate our approach with an application to HIV prevention and treatment.","810":"Vibrio cholerae biotype El Tor is perpetuating the longest cholera pandemic in recorded history. The genomic islands VSP-1 and VSP-2 distinguish El Tor from previous pandemic V. cholerae strains. Using a co-occurrence analysis of VSP genes in >200,000 bacterial genomes we built gene networks to infer biological functions encoded in these islands. This revealed that dncV, a component of the cyclic-oligonucleotide-based anti-phage signalling system (CBASS) anti-phage defence system, co-occurs with an uncharacterized gene vc0175 that we rename avcD for anti-viral cytodine deaminase. We show that AvcD is a deoxycytidylate deaminase and that its activity is post-translationally inhibited by a non-coding RNA named AvcI. AvcID and bacterial homologues protect bacterial populations against phage invasion by depleting free deoxycytidine nucleotides during infection, thereby decreasing phage replication. Homologues of avcD exist in all three domains of life, and bacterial AvcID defends against phage infection by combining traits of two eukaryotic innate viral immunity proteins, APOBEC and SAMHD1.","811":"Contact plays a critical role in infectious disease transmission. Characterizing heterogeneity in contact patterns across individuals, time, and space is necessary to inform accurate estimates of transmission risk, particularly to explain superspreading, predict age differences in vulnerability, and inform social distancing policies. Current respiratory disease models often rely on data from the 2008 POLYMOD study conducted in Europe, which is now outdated and potentially unrepresentative of behavior in the US. We seek to understand the variation in contact patterns across spatial scales and demographic and social classifications, whether there is seasonality to contact patterns, and what social behavior looks like at baseline in the absence of an ongoing pandemic.We analyze spatiotemporal non-household contact patterns across 11 million survey responses from June 2020 - April 2021 post-stratified on age and gender to correct for sample representation. To characterize spatiotemporal heterogeneity in respiratory contact patterns at the county-week scale, we use generalized additive models. In the absence of pre-pandemic data on contact in the US, we also use a regression approach to produce baseline contact estimates to fill this gap.Although contact patterns varied over time during the pandemic, contact is relatively stable after controlling for disease. We find that the mean number of non-household contacts is spatially heterogeneous regardless of disease. There is additional heterogeneity across age, gender, race\/ethnicity, and contact setting, with mean contact decreasing with age and lower in women. The contacts of white individuals and contacts at work or social events change the most under increased national incidence.We develop the first county-level estimates of non-pandemic contact rates for the US that can fill critical gaps in parameterizing disease models. Our results identify that spatiotemporal, demographic, and social heterogeneity in contact patterns is highly structured, informing the risk landscape of respiratory disease transmission in the US.","812":"Our study is one of the first to collect and analyze human mobility data at a daily scale during symptomatic infection. Accounting for the observed changes in human mobility throughout illness will improve understanding of the impact of disease on DENV transmission dynamics and the interpretation of public health-based surveillance data.Through community-based febrile surveillance and RT-PCR assays, we identified a cohort of DENV+ residents of the city of Iquitos, Peru (n = 63). Using retrospective interviews, we measured the movements of these individuals when healthy and during each day of symptomatic illness. The most dramatic changes in mobility occurred during the first three days after symptom onset; individuals visited significantly fewer locations (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.017) and spent significantly more time at home (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.005), compared to when healthy. By 7-9 days after symptom onset, mobility measures had returned to healthy levels. Throughout an individual's symptomatic period, the day of illness and their subjective sense of well-being were the most significant predictors for the number of locations and houses they visited.Human mobility plays a central role in shaping pathogen transmission by generating spatial and\/or individual variability in potential pathogen-transmitting contacts. Recent research has shown that symptomatic infection can influence human mobility and pathogen transmission dynamics. Better understanding the complex relationship between symptom severity, infectiousness, and human mobility requires quantification of movement patterns throughout infectiousness. For dengue virus (DENV), human infectiousness peaks 0-2 days after symptom onset, making it paramount to understand human movement patterns from the beginning of illness.","813":"The recent boom in microfluidics and combinatorial indexing strategies, combined with low sequencing costs, has empowered single-cell sequencing technology. Thousands-or even millions-of cells analyzed in a single experiment amount to a data revolution in single-cell biology and pose unique data science problems. Here, we outline eleven challenges that will be central to bringing this emerging field of single-cell data science forward. For each challenge, we highlight motivating research questions, review prior work, and formulate open problems. This compendium is for established researchers, newcomers, and students alike, highlighting interesting and rewarding problems for the coming years.","814":"Mathematical models of epidemiological systems enable investigation of and predictions about potential disease outbreaks. However, commonly used models are often highly simplified representations of incredibly complex systems. Because of these simplifications, the model output, of, say, new cases of a disease over time or when an epidemic will occur, may be inconsistent with the available data. In this case, we must improve the model, especially if we plan to make decisions based on it that could affect human health and safety, but direct improvements are often beyond our reach. In this work, we explore this problem through a case study of the Zika outbreak in Brazil in 2016. We propose an embedded discrepancy operator\u2014a modification to the model equations that requires modest information about the system and is calibrated by all relevant data. We show that the new enriched model demonstrates greatly increased consistency with real data. Moreover, the method is general enough to easily apply to many other mathematical models in epidemiology.\r\nPotential epidemics of communicable diseases are a major health concern of the modern world, especially as city density, air and water pollution, and worldwide travel steadily increase. A stark example of this is the global coronavirus outbreak, already responsible for more than 2000 deaths around the world at the time of this article\u2019s submission and more than 13\u2009000 at the time of revision, approximately one month later. When faced with a potential outbreak, decision-makers such as health officials and medical professionals rely on mathematical models to aid their decision-making processes. However, oftentimes, these models are not consistent with the dynamical system they are designed to represent. The discrepancy between the output of a model and the real system is then a serious impediment, as it may decrease our confidence in the model, or even invalidate it entirely, so that it can no longer be used to aid in decision-making. When such a discrepancy is observed, we, as modelers, must either improve the model or somehow account for the discrepancy itself. While a direct model improvement is usually the most desirable solution, how to do so may be infeasible because of computational reasons, time constraints, or lack of domain knowledge. This paper provides a systematic method to instead account for the discrepancy itself, explored via a case study of the Brazilian Zika epidemic of 2016. The method is not a correction of the model output to data, but rather a modification of the model equations themselves by a so-called embedded discrepancy operator. The operator is designed with three critical properties in mind: interpretability, domain-consistency, and robustness. We show that including the embedded discrepancy operator greatly increases the fidelity of the model so that the model output and real data are now in fact consistent.","815":"CD8 T cells can play both a protective and pathogenic role in inflammation and autoimmune development. Recent studies have highlighted the ability of CD8 T cells to function as T follicular helper (Tfh) cells in the germinal center in the context of infection. However, whether this phenomenon occurs in autoimmunity and contributes to autoimmune pathogenesis is largely unexplored. In this study, we show that CD8 T cells acquire a CD4 Tfh profile in the absence of functional regulatory T cells in both the IL-2-deficient and scurfy mouse models. Depletion of CD8 T cells mitigates autoimmune pathogenesis in IL-2-deficient mice. CD8 T cells express the B cell follicle-localizing chemokine receptor CXCR5, a principal Tfh transcription factor Bcl6, and the Tfh effector cytokine IL-21. CD8 T cells localize to the B cell follicle, express B cell costimulatory proteins, and promote B cell differentiation and Ab isotype class switching. These data reveal a novel contribution of autoreactive CD8 T cells to autoimmune disease, in part, through CD4 follicular-like differentiation and functionality.","816":"Recent outbreaks of Avian Influenza across Europe have highlighted the potential for syndromic surveillance systems that consider other modes of data, namely social media. This study investigates the feasibility of using social media, primarily Twitter, to monitor illness outbreaks such as avian flu. Using temporal, geographical, and correlation analyses, we investigated the association between avian influenza tweets and officially verified cases in the United Kingdom in 2021 and 2022. Pearson correlation coefficient, bivariate Moran's I analysis and time series analysis, were among the methodologies used. The findings show a weak, statistically insignificant relationship between the number of tweets and confirmed cases in a temporal context, implying that relying simply on social media data for surveillance may be insufficient. The spatial analysis provided insights into the overlaps between confirmed cases and tweet locations, shedding light on regionally targeted interventions during outbreaks. Although social media can be useful for understanding public sentiment and concerns during outbreaks, it must be combined with traditional surveillance methods and official data sources for a more accurate and comprehensive approach. Improved data mining techniques and real-time analysis can improve outbreak detection and response even further. This study underscores the need of having a strong surveillance system in place to properly monitor and manage disease outbreaks and protect public health.","817":"We used a previously published dynamic transmission model of HAV transmission, calibrated to surveillance data from outbreaks involving PWID in 16 states. Using state-level calibrated models, we estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) and herd immunity threshold for PWID in each state. We performed a meta-analysis of herd immunity thresholds to determine the critical vaccination coverage required to prevent most HAV outbreaks among PWID.Estimates of R0 for HAV infection ranged from 2.2 (95% CI 1.9-2.5) for North Carolina to 5.0 (95% CI 4.5-5.6) for West Virginia. Corresponding herd immunity thresholds ranged from 55% (95% CI 47-61%) for North Carolina to 80% (95% CI 78-82%) for West Virginia. Based on the meta-analysis, we estimated a pooled herd immunity threshold of 64% (95% CI 61-68%, 90% prediction interval 52-76%) among PWID. Using the prediction interval upper bound (76%) and assuming 95% vaccine efficacy, we estimate a vaccination coverage of 80% could prevent most HAV outbreaks.Widespread outbreaks of person-to-person transmission of hepatitis A virus (HAV), particularly among people who inject drugs (PWID), continue across the United States and globally. However, the herd immunity threshold and vaccination coverage required to prevent outbreaks is unknown. We aimed to use surveillance data and dynamic modeling to estimate herd immunity thresholds among PWID in 16 U.S. states.Hepatitis A vaccination programs in the United States may need to achieve vaccination coverage of at least 80% among PWID in order to prevent most HAV outbreaks among this population.","818":"Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) A H5, particularly clade 2.3.4.4, has caused worldwide outbreaks in domestic poultry, occasional spillover to humans, and increasing deaths of diverse species of wild birds since 2014. Wild bird migration is currently acknowledged as an important ecological process contributing to the global dispersal of HPAIV H5. However, this mechanism has not been quantified using bird movement data from different species, and the timing and location of exposure of different species is unclear. We sought to explore these questions through phylodynamic analyses based on empirical data of bird movement tracking and virus genome sequences of clade 2.3.4.4 and 2.3.2.1. First, we demonstrate that seasonal bird migration can explain salient features of the global dispersal of clade 2.3.4.4. Second, we detect synchrony between the seasonality of bird annual cycle phases and virus lineage movements. We reveal the differing exposed bird orders at geographical origins and destinations of HPAIV H5 clade 2.3.4.4 lineage movements, including relatively under-discussed orders. Our study provides a phylodynamic framework that links the bird movement ecology and genomic epidemiology of avian influenza; it highlights the importance of integrating bird behavior and life history in avian influenza studies.","819":"Population ageing was associated with 92.8 million DALYs between 1990 and 2017 in China, of which 65.8% (61.1 million) were years of life lost (YLLs). Males had comparatively more DALYs associated with population ageing than females in the study period. The five leading causes of DALYs associated with population ageing between 1990 and 2017 were stroke (23.6 million), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (18.3 million), ischemic heart disease (13.0 million), tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer (6.1 million) and liver cancer (5.0 million). Between 1990 and 2017, changes in DALYs associated with age-specific DALY rate reductions far exceeded those related to population ageing (-\u2009196.2 million versus 92.8 million); 57.5% (-\u2009112.8 million) of DALYs were caused by decreases in rates attributed to 84 modifiable risk factors.The Chinese population has aged significantly in the last few decades. Comprehensive health losses including both fatal and non-fatal health outcomes associated with ageing in China have not been detailed.Based on freely accessible disability adjusted life years (DALYs) estimated by the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) 2017, we adopted a robust decomposition method that ascribes changes in DALYs in any given country across two time points to changes resulting from three sources: population size, age structure, and age-specific DALYs rate per 100,000 population. Using the method, we calculated DALYs associated with population ageing in China from 1990 to 2017 and examined the counteraction between the effects of DALYs rate change and population ageing. This method extends previous work through attributing the change in DALYs to the three sources.Population ageing was associated with growing health loss in China from 1990 to 2017. Despite the recent progress in alleviating health loss associated with population ageing, the government should encourage scientific research on effective and affordable prevention and control strategies and should consider investment in resources to implement\u00a0strategies nationwide to address the future challenge of population ageing.","820":"Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is responsible for the majority of severe cases of hand, foot, and mouth disease, but little evidence is available on the severity profile of EV-A71 infections. We formulated a hierarchical Bayesian model that synthesized data on diseases\/events associated with EV-A71 and EV-A71 antibody responses to infection among unvaccinated children from large clinical trials of EV-A71 vaccination, which were conducted in Jiangsu and Beijing during 2012 and 2013, to reconstruct the severity profile in a unified framework. On average, 15.1% of the children aged 6-35 months were infected by EV-A71 during 1-year follow-up in a mild epidemic season. We estimated that 9.7%, 2.2%, and 0.6% of children infected with EV-A71 were diagnosed with EV-A71-associated diseases, were hospitalized, and showed severe complications, respectively. We estimated on average 1 death per 10,000 EV-A71 infections for children aged 6-35 months. Approximately 70% of children had \u22654-fold rises in antibody titers after infection. Most EV-A71 infections in young children are mild, and overall 2.2% of the infected patients were hospitalized in the 2 trials. There remain several uncertainties about the immune response after infection and the duration of immunity against EV-A71 reinfection.","821":"The rapid detection of outbreaks is a key step in the effective control and containment of infectious diseases. In particular, the identification of cases which might be epidemiologically linked is crucial in directing outbreak-containment efforts and shaping the intervention of public health authorities. Often this requires the detection of clusters of cases whose numbers exceed those expected by a background of sporadic cases. Quantifying exceedances rapidly is particularly challenging when only few cases are typically reported in a precise location and time. To address such important public health concerns, we present a general method which can detect spatio-temporal deviations from a Poisson point process and estimate the odds of an isolate being part of a cluster. This method can be applied to diseases where detailed geographical information is available. In addition, we propose an approach to explicitly take account of delays in microbial typing. As a case study, we considered invasive group A Streptococcus infection events as recorded and typed by Public Health England from 2015 to 2020.","822":"Over the past 50 years, geneticists have made great strides in understanding how our species' evolutionary history gave rise to current patterns of human genetic diversity classically summarized by Lewontin in his 1972 paper, 'The Apportionment of Human Diversity'. One evolutionary process that requires special attention in both population genetics and statistical genetics is admixture: gene flow between two or more previously separated source populations to form a new admixed population. The admixture process introduces ancestry-based structure into patterns of genetic variation within and between populations, which in turn influences the inference of demographic histories, identification of genetic targets of selection and prediction of complex traits. In this review, we outline some challenges for admixture population genetics, including limitations of applying methods designed for populations without recent admixture to the study of admixed populations. We highlight recent studies and methodological advances that aim to overcome such challenges, leveraging genomic signatures of admixture that occurred in the past tens of generations to gain insights into human history, natural selection and complex trait architecture. This article is part of the theme issue 'Celebrating 50 years since Lewontin's apportionment of human diversity'.","823":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly evolving, highly transmissible, and potentially lethal pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of June 11 2020, more than 7,000,000 COVID-19 cases have been reported worldwide, and more than 400,000 patients have died, affecting at least 188 countries. While literature on the disease is rapidly accumulating, an integrated, multinational perspective on clinical manifestations, immunological effects, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19 can be of global benefit. We aimed to synthesize the most relevant literature and experiences in different parts of the world through our global consortium of experts to provide a consensus-based document at this early stage of the pandemic.","824":" (MRSA) than in comparison to 2D-HaCaT monolayers. We investigated the difference in adhesion, internalization, and the apoptotic index in HaCaT monolayers and our 3D-skin model using six strains of MRSA representing different clonal types, namely, ST8, ST30, ST59, ST22, ST45 and ST239. All the six strains exhibited internalization in HaCaT cells. Due to cell detachment, the invasion study was limited up to two and a half hours. TUNEL assay showed no significant difference in the cell death induced by the six MRSA strains in the HaCaT cells. Our 3D-skin model provided a better insight into the interactions between the MRSA strains and the human skin during the infection establishment as we could study the infection of MRSA in our skin model up to 48 h. Immunohistochemical staining together with TUNEL assay in the 3D-skin model showed co-localization of the bacteria with the apoptotic cells demonstrating the induction of apoptosis by the bacteria and revealed the variation in bacterial transmigration among the MRSA strains. The strain representing ST59 showed maximum internalization in HaCaT cells and the maximum cell death as measured by Apoptotic index in the 3D-skin model. Our results show that 3D-skin model might be more likely to imitate the physiological response of skin to MRSA infection than 2D-HaCaT monolayer keratinocyte cultures and will enhance our understanding of the difference in pathogenesis among different MRSA strains.","825":" In hypothetical modeling to determine whether surgery versus MT is optimal for indeterminate (Bethesda III\/IV) nodules, either of the major MT was considerably more cost-effective than DL, although TSv3 was more likely to be cost-effective than GSC. Use of either MT adjunct should be strongly considered in the absence of other indications for thyroidectomy.","826":"Neisseria gonorrhoeae is an urgent public health threat due to rapidly increasing incidence and antibiotic resistance. In contrast with the trend of increasing resistance, clinical isolates that have reverted to susceptibility regularly appear, prompting questions about which pressures compete with antibiotics to shape gonococcal evolution. Here, we used genome-wide association to identify loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the efflux pump mtrCDE operon as a mechanism of increased antibiotic susceptibility and demonstrate that these mutations are overrepresented in cervical relative to urethral isolates. This enrichment holds true for LOF mutations in another efflux pump, farAB, and in urogenitally-adapted versus typical N. meningitidis, providing evidence for a model in which expression of these pumps in the female urogenital tract incurs a fitness cost for pathogenic Neisseria. Overall, our findings highlight the impact of integrating microbial population genomics with host metadata and demonstrate how host environmental pressures can lead to increased antibiotic susceptibility.","827":"OMRSE's coverage has been expanding in recent years to include a wide variety of classes and has been useful in several biomedical applications.We report recent development of OMRSE which includes representations of organizations, roles, facilities, demographic data, enrollment in insurance plans, and data about socio-economic indicators.The Ontology of Medically Related Social Entities (OMRSE) was initially developed in 2011 to provide a framework for modeling demographic data in Resource Description Framework\/Web Ontology Language. It is built upon the Basic Formal Ontology and conforms to Open Biomedical Ontologies Foundry's best practices.","828":"Contrary to our hypothesis, our evidence suggests Twitter content differs significantly from English mass media content. Evidence from our study helps inform media monitoring and communications surveillance during global public health crises, such as infectious disease outbreaks, as well as reactions to health promotion campaigns.The results of the latent Dirichlet allocation modeling on the specific subcorpora with country co-occurring hashtags showed significant differences between the 5 countries in terms of content. English mass media content focused largely on violence\/conflicts and cases of polio, whereas social media focused on eradication and vaccination efforts along with celebrations.We retrospectively examined a 40% random sample of Twitter data containing the hashtag #polio from January 1, 2014, to April 30, 2015 (N = 79,333), from which we extracted 5 subcorpora each with a co-occurring hashtag #India (n = 5027), #Iraq (n = 1238), #Nigeria (n = 1364), #Pakistan (n = 11,427), and #Syria (n = 2952). We also retrieved and categorized 73 polio-related English-language news stories from within the same timeframe. We assessed the association between polio-related English news themes and the Twitter content. Descriptive analyses and unsupervised machine learning (latent Dirichlet allocation modeling) were conducted on the 5 Twitter subcorpora.Twitter and media coverage on poliomyelitis help maintain global support for its eradication.To test our hypothesis that themes of polio-related tweets and media articles would differ by location of interest (hashtag of country name mentioned in the tweet; country name mentioned in media articles) but would be similar to each other (tweets and media articles) for each location of interest.","829":"This paper aims to study the global stability of an Ebola virus epidemic model. Although this epidemic ended in September 2015, it devastated several West African countries and mobilized the international community. With the recent cases of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the threat of the reappearance of this fatal disease remains. Therefore, we are obligated to be prepared for a possible re-emerging of the disease. In this work, we investigate the global stability analysis via the theory of cooperative systems, and we determine the conditions that lead to global stability diseases free and endemic equilibrium.","830":"Of 13 mathematical modelling studies of human inhalational anthrax attacks, there were six studies that took atmospheric dispersion of anthrax spores into account. Further, only two modelling studies had potential utility for real-time decision support, and only one model was validated using real data.Anthrax is a potential biological weapon and can be used in an air-borne or mail attack, such as in the attack in the United States in 2001. Planning for such an event requires the best available science. Since large-scale experiments are not feasible, mathematical modelling is a crucial tool to inform planning. The aim of this study is to systematically review and evaluate the approaches to mathematical modelling of inhalational anthrax attack to support public health decision making and response.A systematic review of inhalational anthrax attack models was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. The models were reviewed based on a set of defined criteria, including the inclusion of atmospheric dispersion component and capacity for real-time decision support.The limited modelling studies available use widely varying methods, assumptions, and data. Estimation of attack size using different models may be quite different, and is likely to be under-estimated by models which do not consider weather conditions. Validation with available data is crucial and may improve models. Further, there is a need for both complex models that can provide accurate atmospheric dispersion modelling, as well as for simpler modelling tools that provide real-time decision support for epidemic response.","831":"Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are highest risk for HIV seroconversion in the United States. Little attention has been paid to marijuana use among BMSM and potential for HIV risk. A sample of 202 BMSM was generated through respondent driven sampling. The relationship between differential marijuana use and both HIV risk behavior and social network factors were examined using weighted logistic regression. Of the BMSM in this sample 60.4 % use marijuana in general and 20.8 % use marijuana as sex-drug. General marijuana use was significantly associated with participation in group sex (AOR 3.50; 95 % CI 1.10-11.10) while marijuana use as a sex drug was significantly associated with both participation in condomless sex (AOR 2.86; 95% CI 1.07-7.67) and group sex (AOR 3.39; 95% CI 1.03-11.22). Respondents with a moderate or high perception of network members who use marijuana were more likely to use marijuana both in general and as a sex-drug. Network member marijuana use, while not associated with risk behaviors, is associated with individual marijuana use and individual marijuana use in the context of sex is associated with risk practices. Targeting interventions towards individuals and their respective networks that use marijuana as a sex drug may reduce HIV risk.","832":"Salmonellosis is one of the most common foodborne diseases worldwide, with the ability to infect humans and animals. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and, particularly, multidrug resistance (MDR) among Salmonella enterica poses a risk to human health. Antimicrobial use (AMU) regulations in livestock have been implemented to reduce AMR and MDR in foodborne pathogens. In this study, we used an integrated machine learning approach to investigate Salmonella AMR and MDR patterns before and after the implementation of AMU restrictions in agriculture in the United States. For this purpose, Salmonella isolates from cattle in the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) dataset were analysed using three descriptive models consisting of hierarchical clustering, network analysis, and association rule mining. The analysis showed the impact of the United States' 2012 extra-label cephalosporin regulations on AMR trends and revealed a distinctive MDR pattern in the Dublin serotype. The results also indicated that each descriptive model provides insights on a specific aspect of resistance patterns and, therefore, combining these approaches make it possible to gain a deeper understanding of AMR.","833":"Sexual reproduction provides an evolutionary advantageous mechanism that combines favorable mutations that have arisen in separate lineages into the same individual. This advantage is especially pronounced in microparasites as allelic reassortment among individuals caused by sexual reproduction promotes allelic diversity at immune evasion genes within individuals which is often essential to evade host immune systems. Despite these advantages, many eukaryotic microparasites exhibit highly-clonal population structures suggesting that genetic exchange through sexual reproduction is rare. Evidence supporting clonality is particularly convincing in the causative agent of Chagas disease, Trypanosoma cruzi, despite equally convincing evidence of the capacity to engage in sexual reproduction.In the present study, we investigated two hypotheses that can reconcile the apparent contradiction between the observed clonal population structure and the capacity to engage in sexual reproduction by analyzing the genome sequences of 123 T. cruzi isolates from a natural population in Arequipa, Peru. The distribution of polymorphic markers within and among isolates provides clear evidence of the occurrence of sexual reproduction. Large genetic segments are rearranged among chromosomes due to crossing over during meiosis leading to a decay in the genetic linkage among polymorphic markers compared to the expectations from a purely asexually-reproducing population. Nevertheless, the population structure appears clonal due to a high level of inbreeding during sexual reproduction which increases homozygosity, and thus reduces diversity, within each inbreeding lineage.These results effectively reconcile the apparent contradiction by demonstrating that the clonal population structure is derived not from infrequent sex in natural populations but from high levels of inbreeding. We discuss epidemiological consequences of this reproductive strategy on genome evolution, population structure, and phenotypic diversity of this medically important parasite.","834":"Depression is often accompanied by thoughts of self-harm, which are a strong predictor of subsequent suicide attempt and suicide death. Few empirical data are available regarding the temporal correlation between depression symptoms and suicidal ideation. We investigated the anecdotal concern that suicidal ideation may increase during a period of depression improvement.Longitudinal Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 is a questionnaire of 9 multiple-choice questions to assess the frequency of depressive symptoms within the previous two weeks. We analyzed a chronic depression treatment population's electronic health record (EHR) data, containing 610 patients' longitudinal PHQ-9 scores (62% age 45 and older; 68% female) within 40 weeks.The irregular and sparse EHR data were transformed into continuous trajectories using Gaussian process regression. We first estimated the correlations between the symptoms (total score of the first 8 questions; PHQ-8) and suicide ideation (9th question score; Item 9) using the cross-correlation function. We then used an artificial neural network (ANN) to discover subtypes of depression patterns from the fitted depression trajectories. In addition, we conducted a separate analysis using the unfitted raw PHQ scores to examine PHQ-8's and Item 9's pattern changes.Results showed that the majority of patients' PHQ-8 and Item 9 scores displayed strong temporal correlations. We found five patterns in the PHQ-8 and the Item 9 trajectories. We also found 8% - 13% of the patients have experienced an increase in suicidal ideation during the improvement of their PHQ-8. Using a trajectory-based method for subtype pattern detection in depression progression, we provided a better understanding of temporal correlations between depression symptoms over time.","835":"Recent research has documented a wide range of health, economic, and social benefits conferred by vaccination, beyond the direct reductions in morbidity, mortality, and future healthcare costs traditionally captured in economic evaluations. In this paper, we describe the societal benefits that would likely stem from widespread administration of safe and effective vaccines against Streptococcus pyogenes (Strep A), which was estimated to be the fifth-leading cause of infectious disease deaths globally prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. We then estimate the global societal gains from prospective Strep A vaccination through a value-per-statistical-life approach. Estimated aggregate lifetime benefits for 30 global birth cohorts range from $1.7 to $5.1 trillion, depending on the age at which vaccination is administered and other factors. These results suggest that the benefits of Strep A vaccination would be large and justify substantial investment in the vaccines' development, manufacture, and delivery.","836":"Fractional dose is an important strategy to increase access to vaccines. This study evaluated the effectiveness, safety, and immunogenicity of half dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. A non-inferiority non-randomized controlled trial compared a half dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 with the full dose, with an interval of 8 to 10 weeks, in individuals aged 18-49 years. The primary endpoints were the incidence rate of new cases\/1,000 person-year at 90 days after 14 days of the second dose, confirmed by RT-PCR and new cases registered at SUS National Health Surveillance Database (e-SUS VS). The anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) by chemiluminescence and the neutralizing antibodies by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) were titrated. The soluble biomarkers were quantified with a multiplex immunoassay. Follow-up was 90 days after 14 days of the second dose. A total of 29,598 individuals were vaccinated. After exclusion, 16,570 individuals who received half a dose and 6,402 who received full doses were analyzed. The incidence of new cases confirmed by RT-PCR of half dose was non-inferior to full dose (23.7 vs. 25.7 cases per 1,000 persons-year [coefficient group -0.09 CI95%(-0.49 to 0.31)], even after adjusting for age and sex. There were no deaths or hospitalization after immunization of either group. Immunogenicity was evaluated in a subsample (N=558) compared to 154 healthcare workers who received a full dose. The seroconversion rate in seronegative individuals at baseline half dose was 99.8%, similar to that of the full dose (100%). Geometric mean concentration (95% CI; BAU\/mL) were half dose = 188 (163-217) and full dose = 529 (423-663) (p < 0.001). In seropositive subjects at baseline (pre-immune individuals), the first dose induced very high and similar IgG-S in half dose 1,359 (1,245-1,483) and full dose 1,354 (1,048-1,749) BAU\/mL. A half dose induced a high increase in plasma chemokines, pro-inflammatory\/regulatory cytokines, and growth factors. The frequency of adverse events was similar. No serious adverse events or deaths were reported. A half dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is as effective, safe, and immunogenic as the full dose. The immune response in pre-immune (seropositive in the baseline) individuals indicates that the half dose may be a booster dose schedule.","837":"Heat stress illnesses represent a rising public health threat; however, associations between environmental heat and observed adverse health outcomes across populations and geographies remain insufficiently elucidated to evaluate risk and develop prevention strategies. In particular, military-relevant large-scale studies of daily heat stress morbidity responses among physically active, working-age adults to various indices of heat have been limited. We evaluated daily means, maximums, minimums, and early morning measures of temperature, heat index, and wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) indices, assessing their association with 31,642 case-definition heat stroke and heat exhaustion encounters among active duty servicemembers diagnosed at 24 continental US installations from 1998 to 2019. We utilized anonymized encounter data consisting of hospitalizations, ambulatory (out-patient) visits, and reportable events to define heat stress illness cases and select the 24 installations with the highest case counts. We derived daily indices of heat from hourly-scale gridded climate data and applied a case-crossover study design incorporating distributed-lag, nonlinear models with 5\u00a0days of lag to estimate odds ratios at one-degree increments for each index of heat. All indices exhibited nonlinear odds ratios with short-term lag effects throughout observed temperature ranges. Responses were positive, monotonic, and exponential in nature, except for maximum daily WBGT, minimum daily temperature, temperature at 0600\u00a0h (local), and WBGT at 0600\u00a0h (local), which, while generally increasing, showed decreasing risk for the highest heat category days. The risk for a heat stress illness on a day with a maximum WBGT of 32.2\u00a0\u00b0C (90.0 \u00b0F) was 1.93 (95% CI, 1.82 - 2.05) times greater than on a day with a maximum WBGT of 28.6\u00a0\u00b0C (83.4 \u00b0F). The risk was 2.53 (2.36-2.71) times greater on days with a maximum heat index of 40.6\u00a0\u00b0C (105 \u00b0F) compared to 32.8\u00a0\u00b0C (91.0 \u00b0F). Our findings suggest that prevention efforts may benefit from including prior-day heat levels in risk assessments, from monitoring temperature and heat index in addition to WBGT, and by promoting control measures and awareness across all heat categories.","838":"This document provides the analytic plan for evaluating adult HIV incidence, health, and implementation outcomes for the first phase of the SEARCH Study. Locked: November 27, 2017. Embargoed until July 25, 2018.","839":"Vaccinating 50% of Palestinian workers is predicted to reduce the annual influenza burden by 28,745 cases (95% CI: 15,031-50,717) and 37.7 deaths (95% CI: 19\u00b79-65\u00b75) for the Israeli population, and by 32,9900 cases (95% CI: 14,379-51,531) and 20.2 deaths (CI 95%: 9\u00b78-31\u00b75) for the Palestinian population. Further, we found that as the indirect protection was so substantial, funding such a vaccination campaign would be cost-saving from the Israeli Ministry of Health perspective.Offering influenza vaccination to Palestinians employed in Israel could efficiently reduce morbidity and mortality within both Israel and the Palestinian territory.To evaluate the epidemiological and the economic benefits conferred by vaccinating Palestinians employed in Israel, we developed a model of influenza transmission within and between Israel and the West Bank. We parameterized the contact patterns underlying transmission by conducting a survey among Palestinians employed in Israel, and integrating survey results with traffic patterns and socio-demographic data.Influenza is a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality for Israel and the Palestinian territory. Given the extensive interaction between the two populations, vaccination in one population may indirectly benefit the other via reduced transmission. Due to the mobility and extensive contacts, Palestinians employed in Israel could be a prime target for vaccination.","840":"Bioaerosol samples were collected in an airborne infection isolation room, bathroom, and anteroom of a ventilated patient with coronavirus disease 2019. Twenty-eight samples were negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid, possibly due to the patient being on a closed-circuit ventilator or the efficiency of the air exchanges in the room.","841":"Important questions remain about the sources of transmission of pneumococcus to older adults in the community. This is critical for understanding the potential effects of using pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) in children and older adults. For non-institutionalized individuals, we hypothesized that the most likely source of adult-to-adult transmission is within the household. We designed a longitudinal study to sample adults \u226560 years of age living in the same household (New Haven, CT, USA), without younger residents in the household. Saliva samples and social and health questionnaires were obtained every 2 weeks for a period of 10 weeks. DNA extracted from culture-enriched saliva was tested using qPCR for pneumococcus genes piaB, lytA, and serotype. Across two study seasons (November 2020-August 2021, November 2021-September 2022), 121 individuals from 61 households completed all six visits; 62 individuals were enrolled in both seasons. Overall, 52\/1088 (4.8%) samples tested positive for pneumococcus, with 27\/121 (22.3%) individuals colonized at least once. Several individuals were colonized at multiple time points; two individuals were colonized at 5\/6 time points and two at all six. In 5 instances, both household members were carriers in the same season, though not necessarily at the same time. Pneumococcal carriage was substantially higher among individuals who had contact with children (10.0%\u00a0vs. 1.6%). Contact with young children was the most important factor that influenced pneumococcal acquisition rates. While there were several instances where both adult household members were colonized at the same time or at sequential visits, these individuals typically had contact with children. As such, PCV immunization can directly protect older adults who have contact with children.","842":"Amidst Delta variant circulation, we found that schools are not inherently low risk, yet can be made so with high community vaccination coverages and masking. Vaccination of adults protects unvaccinated children.We examined school reopening policies amidst ongoing transmission of the highly transmissible Delta variant, accounting for vaccination among individuals \u226512 years.At 70% vaccination coverage, universal masking reduced infections by >57% among students. Masking plus 70% vaccination coverage enabled achievement of <50 excess cases per 1,000 students\/teachers, but stricter risk tolerances, such as <25 excess infections per 1,000 students\/teachers, required a cohort approach in elementary and middle school populations. In the absence of NPIs, increasing the vaccination coverage of community members from 50% to 70% or elementary teachers from 70% to 95% reduced the excess rate of infection among elementary school students attributable to school transmission by 24% and 37%, respectively.National Science Foundation grant no. 2032210; National Institutes of Health grant nos. R01AI125842 and R01AI148336; MIDAS Coordination Center (MIDASSUP2020-4).We collected data on social contacts among school-aged children in the California Bay Area and developed an individual-based transmission model to simulate transmission of the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 in schools. We evaluated the additional infections in students and teachers\/staff resulting over a 128-day semester from in-school instruction compared to remote instruction when various NPIs (mask use, cohorts, and weekly testing of students\/teachers) were implemented, across various community-wide vaccination coverages (50%, 60%, 70%), and student (\u226512 years) and teacher\/staff vaccination coverages (50% - 95%).","843":"Increases in MIC of antibiotics generally correlates with increased tolerance to EOs. For cinnamon EO, however, the opposite was observed.We investigated the antibacterial effect of seven essential oils (EOs) and one EO-containing liquid phytogenic solution marketed for poultry and pigs ('Product A') on chicken pathogens, as well as the relationship between MIC in EOs and antibiotics commonly administered to chicken flocks in the Mekong Delta (Vietnam).Our results suggest increased antibacterial effects of EOs on multi-drug resistant pathogens; cinnamon EO was particularly effective against bacterial poultry pathogens.Micellar extracts from oregano (Origanum vulgare), cajeput (Melaleuca leucadendra), garlic (Allium sativum), black pepper (Piper nigrum), peppermint (Mentha \u00d7 piperita L.), tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia), cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) EOs and Product A were investigated for their Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) against Avibacterium endocarditidis (N=10), Pasteurella multocida (N=7), Ornitobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT) (N=10), Escherichia coli (N=10) and Gallibacterium anatis (N=10). Cinnamon EO had the lowest median MIC across strains (median 0.5mg\/ml [interquartile range (IQR) 0.3-2.0mg\/ml]), followed by Product A (3.8mg\/ml [1.9-3.8mg\/ml]), oregano EO (30.4mg\/ml [7.6-60.8mg\/ml]), garlic 63.1mg\/ml [3.9->505.0mg\/ml]. Peppermint, tea tree, cajeput and pepper EOs had all MIC\u2265219mg\/ml. In addition, we determined the MIC of the 12 most commonly used antibiotics in chicken flocks in the area. After accounting for pathogen species, we found an independent, statistically significant (p<0.05) positive correlation between MIC of 10 of 28 (35.7%) pairs of EOs. For 67\/96 (69.8%) combinations of EOs and antibiotics, the MICs were correlated. Of all antibiotics, doxycycline was positively associated with the highest number of EOs (peppermint, tea tree, black pepper and cajeput, all p<0.05). For cinnamon, the MICs were negatively correlated with the MICs of 11\/12 antimicrobial tested (all except colistin).","844":"We transformed data from previously performed mixed-methods needs assessment studies into functional user requirements using agile development methods. Requirements took the form of user stories that were prioritized to drive implementation of RxMAGIC as a web-application. A functional prototype was developed and tested to understand its perceived usefulness before developing a production system. Prior to deployment, we evaluated the usability of RxMAGIC with six users to diagnose potential interaction challenges that may be avoided through redesign. The results from this study were similarly prioritized and informed the final features of the production system.We built RxMAGIC, an open-source, pharmacist-facing dispensary management information system that augments the pharmacist's ability to efficiently deliver medication services in a free clinic setting. RxMAGIC provides electronic dispensing and automated inventory management and alerting capabilities. We deployed RxMAGIC at the Birmingham Free Clinic and measured its usability with potential users. In future work, we plan to continue to measure the impact of RxMAGIC on pharmacist efficiency and satisfaction.To address challenges related to medication management in underserved settings, we developed a system for Prescription Management And General Inventory Control, or RxMAGIC, in collaboration with the Birmingham Free Clinic in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. RxMAGIC is an interoperable, web-based medication management system designed to standardize and streamline the dispensing practice and improve inventory control in a free clinic setting. This manuscript describes the processes used to design, develop, and deploy RxMAGIC.We developed 45 user stories that acted as functional requirements to incrementally build RxMAGIC. Integrating with the electronic health record at the clinic was a requirement for deployment. We utilized health data standards to communicate with the existing order entry system; an outgoing electronic prescribing framework was leveraged to send prescription data to RxMAGIC. The results of the usability study were positive, with all tested features receiving a mean score of four or five (i.e. somewhat easy or easy, respectively) on a five-point Likert scale assessing ease of completion, thus demonstrating the system's simplicity and high learnability. RxMAGIC was deployed at the clinic in October 2016 over a two-week period.","845":"West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus potentially causing serious illness in humans and other animals. Since 2004, several studies have highlighted the progressive spread of WNV Lineage 2 (L2) in Europe, with Italy being one of the countries with the highest number of cases of West Nile disease reported. In this paper, we give an overview of the epidemiological and genetic features characterising the spread and evolution of WNV L2 in Italy, leveraging data obtained from national surveillance activities between 2011 and 2021, including 46 newly assembled genomes that were analysed under both phylogeographic and phylodynamic frameworks. In addition, to better understand the seasonal patterns of the virus, we used a machine learning model predicting areas at high-risk of WNV spread. Our results show a progressive increase in WNV L2 in Italy, clarifying the dynamics of interregional circulation, with no significant introductions from other countries in recent years. Moreover, the predicting model identified the presence of suitable conditions for the 2022 earlier and wider spread of WNV in Italy, underlining the importance of using quantitative models for early warning detection of WNV outbreaks. Taken together, these findings can be used as a reference to develop new strategies to mitigate the impact of the pathogen on human and other animal health in endemic areas and new regions.","846":"Humans are repeatedly exposed to variants of influenza virus throughout their lifetime. As a result, preexisting influenza-specific memory B cells can dominate the response after infection or vaccination. Memory B cells recalled by adulthood exposure are largely reactive to conserved viral epitopes present in childhood strains, posing unclear consequences on the ability of B cells to adapt to and neutralize newly emerged strains. We sought to investigate the impact of preexisting immunity on generation of protective antibody responses to conserved viral epitopes upon influenza virus infection and vaccination in humans. We accomplished this by characterizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from plasmablasts, which are predominantly derived from preexisting memory B cells. We found that, whereas some influenza infection-induced mAbs bound conserved and neutralizing epitopes on the hemagglutinin (HA) stalk domain or neuraminidase, most of the mAbs elicited by infection targeted non-neutralizing epitopes on nucleoprotein and other unknown antigens. Furthermore, most infection-induced mAbs had equal or stronger affinity to childhood strains, indicating recall of memory B cells from childhood exposures. Vaccination-induced mAbs were similarly induced from past exposures and exhibited substantial breadth of viral binding, although, in contrast to infection-induced mAbs, they targeted neutralizing HA head epitopes. Last, cocktails of infection-induced mAbs displayed reduced protective ability in mice compared to vaccination-induced mAbs. These findings reveal that both preexisting immunity and exposure type shape protective antibody responses to conserved influenza virus epitopes in humans. Natural infection largely recalls cross-reactive memory B cells against non-neutralizing epitopes, whereas vaccination harnesses preexisting immunity to target protective HA epitopes.","847":"This article informally reviews key research ethics guidelines and regulations, academic scholarship, and research studies and finds wide variety in how they consider risk to bystanders in medical research (namely, non-participants whom studies nevertheless place at risk). Some of these key sources give no or very little consideration to bystanders, while others offer them the utmost protection (greater than they offer study participants). This unsettled frontier would benefit from a deeper investigation of the ethics of protecting research bystanders.","848":"Genome and metagenome comparisons based on large amounts of next generation sequencing (NGS) data pose significant challenges for alignment-based approaches due to the huge data size and the relatively short length of the reads. Alignment-free approaches based on the counts of word patterns in NGS data do not depend on the complete genome and are generally computationally efficient. Thus, they contribute significantly to genome and metagenome comparison. Recently, novel statistical approaches have been developed for the comparison of both long and shotgun sequences. These approaches have been applied to many problems including the comparison of gene regulatory regions, genome sequences, metagenomes, binning contigs in metagenomic data, identification of virus-host interactions, and detection of horizontal gene transfers. We provide an updated review of these applications and other related developments of word-count based approaches for alignment-free sequence analysis.","849":"To develop and validate a pragmatic risk score to predict mortality in patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19).In-hospital mortality.An easy-to-use risk stratification score has been developed and validated based on commonly available parameters at hospital presentation. The 4C Mortality Score outperformed existing scores, showed utility to directly inform clinical decision making, and can be used to stratify patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 into different management groups. The score should be further validated to determine its applicability in other populations.International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) study (performed by the ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium-ISARIC-4C) in 260 hospitals across England, Scotland, and Wales. Model training was performed on a cohort of patients recruited between 6 February and 20 May 2020, with validation conducted on a second cohort of patients recruited after model development between 21 May and 29 June 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Adults (age \u226518 years) admitted to hospital with covid-19 at least four weeks before final data extraction.35\u2009463 patients were included in the derivation dataset (mortality rate 32.2%) and 22\u2009361 in the validation dataset (mortality rate 30.1%). The final 4C Mortality Score included eight variables readily available at initial hospital assessment: age, sex, number of comorbidities, respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, level of consciousness, urea level, and C reactive protein (score range 0-21 points). The 4C Score showed high discrimination for mortality (derivation cohort: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 0.79; validation cohort: 0.77, 0.76 to 0.77) with excellent calibration (validation: calibration-in-the-large=0, slope=1.0). Patients with a score of at least 15 (n=4158, 19%) had a 62% mortality (positive predictive value 62%) compared with 1% mortality for those with a score of 3 or less (n=1650, 7%; negative predictive value 99%). Discriminatory performance was higher than 15 pre-existing risk stratification scores (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve range 0.61-0.76), with scores developed in other covid-19 cohorts often performing poorly (range 0.63-0.73).Prospective observational cohort study.ISRCTN66726260.","850":"The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Indian Council of Medical Research.India did phased measles-rubella supplementary immunisation activities (MR-SIAs; ie, mass-immunisation campaigns) targeting children aged 9 months to less than 15 years. We estimated measles-rubella seroprevalence before and after the MR-SIAs to quantify the effect on population immunity and identify remaining immunity gaps.Measles-rubella seroprevalence increased substantially after the MR-SIAs but the serosurvey also identified remaining gaps in population immunity.Specimens were collected from 2570 children before the MR-SIA and from 2619 children afterwards. The weighted MR-SIA coverage ranged from 73\u00b77% to 90\u00b75% in younger children and from 73\u00b76% to 93\u00b76% in older children. Before the MR-SIA, district-level measles seroprevalence was between 80\u00b77% and 88\u00b75% among younger children in all districts, and between 63\u00b74% and 84\u00b75% among older children. After the MR-SIA, measles seroprevalence among younger children increased to more than 90% (range 91\u00b75 to 96\u00b70) in all districts except Kanpur Nagar, in which it remained unchanged 80\u00b74%. Among older children, measles seroprevalence increased to more than 90\u00b70% (range 93\u00b77% to 96\u00b75%) in all districts except Hoshiarpur (88\u00b77%). A significant increase in rubella seroprevalence was observed in all districts in both age groups, with the largest effect in Dibrugarh, where rubella seroprevalence increased from 10\u00b76% to 96\u00b75% among younger children.Between March 9, 2018 and March 19, 2020 we did community-based, cross-sectional serosurveys in four districts in India before and after MR-SIAs. 30 villages or wards were selected within each district, and one census enumeration block from each was selected as the survey cluster. Households were enumerated and 13 children in the younger age group (9 months to <5 years) and 13 children in the older ager group (5 to <15 years) were randomly selected by use of computer-generated random numbers. Serum samples were tested for IgG antibodies to measles and rubella viruses by enzyme immunoassay.","851":"Over the past decade, Lyme and other tick-borne diseases have expanded into urban areas, including Staten Island, New York. While Lyme disease is often researched with a focus on human risk, domestic pets are also at risk of contracting the disease. The present study aims to describe differences in tick exposure, knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) between pet owners and non-owners, and to understand preventive strategies practiced by pet owners for themselves and their pets. We conducted KAP surveys via phone in 2020 and via face-to-face interviews in 2021, and we analyzed unique responses from 364 households on Staten Island. Pet owners were more likely to have ever found a tick on themselves or their household members (63%) than non-owners (46%) (p<0.001). Among pet owners, those who owned dogs (dog-only or both dog and cat owners) were more likely to have ever found a tick on their pets than cat-only owners (p<0.001). Compared with non-pet owners, pet owners were more likely both to know that ticks transmit Lyme disease (p<0.001) and to avoid gardening to reduce their tick exposure (p = 0.032), but they were less likely to wear protective clothing or adjust clothing (p = 0.013). Compared with cat owners who had never found a tick on their cats, cat owners who had ever found a tick on their cats were more likely to let their cats go outside (p<0.001). However, reported preventive measures on cats did not differ between pet owners who did and did not report tick exposure. The results indicate that encouraging pet owners to engage in preventative measures, both to protect themselves and their pets, is a potential avenue for healthcare providers and veterinarians to reduce risks from ticks.","852":"Animal behaviour and the ecology and evolution of parasites are inextricably linked. For this reason, animal behaviourists and disease ecologists have been interested in the intersection of their respective fields for decades. Despite this interest, most research at the behaviour-disease interface focuses either on how host behaviour affects parasites or how parasites affect behaviour, with little overlap between the two. Yet, the majority of interactions between hosts and parasites are probably reciprocal, such that host behaviour feeds back on parasites and vice versa. Explicitly considering these feedbacks is essential for understanding the complex connections between animal behaviour and parasite ecology and evolution. To illustrate this point, we discuss how host behaviour-parasite feedbacks might operate and explore the consequences of feedback for studies of animal behaviour and parasites. For example, ignoring the feedback of host social structure on parasite dynamics can limit the accuracy of predictions about parasite spread. Likewise, considering feedback in studies of parasites and animal personalities may provide unique insight about the maintenance of variation in personality types. Finally, applying the feedback concept to links between host behaviour and beneficial, rather than pathogenic, microbes may shed new light on transitions between mutualism and parasitism. More generally, accounting for host behaviour-parasite feedbacks can help identify critical gaps in our understanding of how key host behaviours and parasite traits evolve and are maintained. ","853":"The repeated evolution of similar phenotypes in independent populations (i.e. parallel or convergent evolution) provides an opportunity to identify genetic and ecological factors that influence the process of adaptation. Threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are an excellent model for such studies, as they have repeatedly adapted to divergent habitats across the Northern hemisphere. Here, we use genomic, ecological and morphological data from 16 independent pairs of stickleback populations adapted to divergent lake and stream habitats. We combine a population genomic approach to identify regions of the genome that are likely under selection in these divergent habitats with an association mapping approach to identify regions of the genome that underlie variation in ecological factors and morphological traits. Over 37% of genomic windows are repeatedly differentiated across lake\u0096stream pairs. Similarly, many genomic windows are associated with variation in abiotic factors, diet items and morphological phenotypes. Both the highly differentiated windows and candidate trait windows are non-randomly distributed across the genome and show some overlap. However, the overlap is not significant on a genome-wide scale. Together, our data suggest that adaptation to divergent food resources and predation regimes are drivers of differentiation in lake\u0096stream stickleback, but that additional ecological factors are also important.","854":"Our data consisted of 1 297 156 product reviews from Amazon.com. Only 5149 (0.4%) were linked to recalled food products. Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformations performed best in identifying unsafe food reviews, achieving an F1 score, precision and recall of 0.74, 0.78, and 0.71, respectively. We also identified synonyms for terms associated with FDA recalls in more than 20 000 reviews, most of which were associated with nonrecalled products. This might suggest that many more products should have been recalled or investigated.Access to safe and nutritious food is essential for good health. However, food can become unsafe due to contamination with pathogens, chemicals or toxins, or mislabeling of allergens. Illness resulting from the consumption of unsafe foods is a global health problem. Here, we develop a machine learning approach for detecting reports of unsafe food products in consumer product reviews from Amazon.com.We linked Amazon.com food product reviews to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) food recalls from 2012 to 2014 using text matching approaches in a PostGres relational database. We applied machine learning methods and over- and under-sampling methods to the linked data to automate the detection of reports of unsafe food products.Challenges to improving food safety include, urbanization which has led to a longer food chain, underreporting of illness and difficulty in linking contaminated food to illness. Our approach can improve food safety by enabling early identification of unsafe foods which can lead to timely recall thereby limiting the health and economic impact on the public.","855":"We estimated a peak vaccine effectiveness between 2 weeks and 3 months following receipt of the second dose, with 85% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 84-86%) and 90% (95% CI: 89-91%) effectiveness against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), respectively. However, in line with findings for adults, waning effectiveness was evident. Long-term protection was reduced to 73% (95% CI: 68-77%) against infection and 79% (95% CI: 73-83%) against COVID-19 3-5 months after the second dose and waned to 53% (95% CI: 46-60%) against infection and 66% (95% CI: 59-72%) against COVID-19 after 5 months.Leveraging the database of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), we conducted a matched case-control design for evaluating the association between time since vaccination and the incidence of infections, where 2 outcomes were evaluated: documented SARS-CoV-2 infection (regardless of symptoms) and symptomatic infection (COVID-19). Cases were defined as individuals aged 12-16 with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test occurring between 15 June and 8 December 2021, when the Delta variant was dominant in Israel. Controls were adolescents who had not tested positive previously.Although vaccine-induced protection against both infection and COVID-19 continues over time in adolescents, the protection wanes with time since vaccination, starting 3 months after inoculation and continuing for more than 5 months.The short-term effectiveness of a 2-dose regimen of the BioNTech\/Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine for adolescents has been demonstrated. However, little is known about the long-term effectiveness in this age group. It is known, however, that waning of vaccine-induced immunity against infection in adult populations is evident within a few months.","856":"As the COVID-19 pandemic spread worldwide, it has become clearer that prevalence of\r\ncertain comorbidities in a given population could make it more vulnerable to serious outcomes\r\nof that disease, including fatality. Indeed, it might be insightful from a health policy perspective\r\nto identify clusters of populations in terms of the associations between their prevalent\r\ncomorbidities and the observed COVID-19 specific death rates. In this study, we described a\r\nmixture of polynomial time series (MoPTS) model to simultaneously identify (a) three clusters\r\nof 86 U.S. cities in terms of their dynamic death rates, and (b) the different associations of\r\nthose rates with 5 key comorbidities among the populations in the clusters. We also described\r\nan EM algorithm for efficient maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters.","857":"The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for rapid novel diagnostic strategies. Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) may allow for the detection of pathogens that can be missed in targeted assays. The goal of this study was to assess the performance of nanopore-based Sequence-Independent Single Primer Amplification (SISPA) for the detection and characterization of SARS-CoV-2.We performed mNGS on clinical samples and designed a diagnostic classifier that corrects for barcode crosstalk between specimens. Phylogenetic analysis was performed on genome assemblies.This study supports future work examining the broader feasibility of nanopore mNGS as a diagnostic strategy for the detection and characterization of viral pathogens.Our assay yielded 100% specificity overall and 95.2% sensitivity for specimens with a RT-PCR cycle threshold value less than 30. We assembled 10 complete, and one near-complete genomes from 20 specimens that were classified as positive by mNGS. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 10\/11 specimens from British Columbia had a closest relative to another British Columbian specimen. We found 100% concordance between phylogenetic lineage assignment and Variant of Concern (VOC) PCR results. Our assay was able to distinguish between the Alpha and Gamma variants, which was not possible with the current standard VOC PCR being used in British Columbia.","858":"We present a stochastic dynamic programming approach to simultaneously identify the optimal intervention and information collection policies. We use our framework to evaluate birth cohort hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening. We focus on how the presence of a time-varying parameter (HCV prevalence) affects the optimal information collection policy for a parameter assumed constant across birth cohorts: liver fibrosis stage distribution for screen-detected diagnosis at age 50.The option to delay information collection until the information is sufficiently likely to influence decisions can increase efficiency. A dynamic programming framework enables an assessment of the marginal value of information and determines the optimal policy, including when and how much information to collect.We prove that it may be optimal to delay information collection until a time when the information more immediately affects decision making. For the example of HCV screening, given initial beliefs, the optimal policy (at 2010) was to continue screening and collect information about the distribution of liver fibrosis at screen-detected diagnosis in 12 years, increasing the expected incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) by $169.5 million compared to current guidelines.The cost-effectiveness and value of additional information about a health technology or program may change over time because of trends affecting patient cohorts and\/or the intervention. Delaying information collection even for parameters that do not change over time may be optimal.","859":"We study age-rating restrictions in the health insurance marketplaces introduced by the Affordable Care Act. Because most buyers are subsidized, although age-rating restrictions affect pre-subsidy premiums, participation is primarily driven by subsidy generosity rather than pricing decisions. Combining pre and post-reform data on prices and enrollment we find that age-rating restrictions altered pre-subsidy premiums: $230\/year for under-50 buyers and -$900\/year for over-50 buyers. Accounting for the ACA subsidy design, this regulation decreased federal spending by more than 10%, and reduced participation by 2% (-4% among under-50, 2% among over-50). These effects differ across regions, varying with the age-composition of the uninsured.","860":"The long-term effects of host factors on vaccine-elicited immune responses have not been well-studied, and the interactions of host factors with annual influenza vaccinations are yet to be explored. We analyzed data from a cohort of 386 individuals who received the standard-dose influenza vaccine and enrolled in multiple seasons (\u22652) from 2016 to 2020. Our analyses indicated disparate vaccine-elicited immune responses between males and females in adults when they were repeatedly vaccinated for at least two seasons. Notably, we found interactive effects between age and BMI on overall immune responses, and between sex at birth and BMI in adults.","861":"Background:\r\n\r\nCase\u0096control studies are useful for rare outcomes, but typical analyses limit investigators to parametric estimation of conditional odds ratios. Several methods exist for obtaining marginal risk differences and risk ratios in a case\u0096control setting, including a recently described semiparametric targeted approach optimized for rare outcomes.\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUsing case\u0096control data from a study of neighborhood poverty and very preterm birth, we demonstrate estimation of marginal risk differences and risk ratios and compare a parametric substitution estimator based on maximum likelihood estimation with targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), and a refinement of TMLE for rare outcomes that incorporates bounds on the conditional risk.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\n\r\nIn this illustration, living in a neighborhood with high poverty was associated with a higher risk of very preterm birth for white women. The estimated risk differences (cases\/100) were 0.6 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.1, 1.1) from maximum likelihood estimation, 0.5 (95% CI: \u22121.1, 2.1) from TMLE, and 0.5 (95% CI: 0.0, 1.0) from the rare outcomes refinement. The rare outcomes refinement, which incorporates knowledge that the conditional risk is small, produced more precise estimates than TMLE. A similar pattern was observed for the relative risk.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nAbsolute and relative associations estimated from case\u0096control data using a semiparametric targeted approach allow the scientific question to determine the analysis and avoid unwarranted parametric assumptions. A rare outcomes refinement provided more precise estimates than TMLE, and thus is well suited for the study of rare outcomes.","862":"SARS-CoV-2-related mortality and hospitalizations differ substantially between New York City neighborhoods. Mitigation efforts require knowing the extent to which these disparities reflect differences in prevalence and understanding the associated drivers. Here, we report the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in New York City boroughs inferred using tests administered to 1,746 pregnant women hospitalized for delivery between March 22nd and May 3rd, 2020. We also assess the relationship between prevalence and commuting-style movements into and out of each borough. Prevalence ranged from 11.3% (95% credible interval [8.9%, 13.9%]) in Manhattan to 26.0% (15.3%, 38.9%) in South Queens, with an estimated city-wide prevalence of 15.6% (13.9%, 17.4%). Prevalence was lowest in boroughs with the greatest reductions in morning movements out of and evening movements into the borough (Pearson R\u2009=\u2009-0.88 [-0.52, -0.99]). Widespread testing is needed to further specify disparities in prevalence and assess the risk of future outbreaks.","863":"The paper contains a complete analysis of the Galton\u0096Watson models with immigration, including the processes in the random environment, stationary or nonstationary ones.

In addition to mitigating transmission of SARS-CoV-2, these public health measures have also functioned in slowing the spread of other endemic respiratory pathogens. Surveillance data from South Africa indicates low circulation of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) throughout the 2020-2021 Southern Hemisphere winter seasons. Here we fit age-structured epidemiological models to national surveillance data to predict the 2022 RSV outbreak following two suppressed seasons. We project a 32% increase in the peak number of monthly hospitalizations among infants \u2264 2 years, with older infants (6-23 month olds) experiencing a larger portion of severe disease burden than typical. Our results suggest that hospital system readiness should be prepared for an intense RSV season in early 2022.","865":"This longitudinal cohort study included adults undergoing inpatient surgery at two university hospitals. Triage classifications were generated by an explainable deep learning model using preoperative and intraoperative electronic health record features. Nearest neighbor algorithms identified risk-matched controls. Primary outcomes were mortality, morbidity, and value of care (inverted risk-adjusted mortality\/total direct costs).In single-institution studies, overtriaging low-risk postoperative patients to ICUs has been associated with a low value of care; undertriaging high-risk postoperative patients to general wards has been associated with increased mortality and morbidity. This study tested the reproducibility of an automated postoperative triage classification system to generating an actionable, explainable decision support system.Overtriage was associated with low value of care; undertriage was associated with both low value of care and increased mortality and morbidity. The proposed framework for generating automated postoperative triage classifications is reproducible.Among 4,669 ICU admissions, 237 (5.1%) were overtriaged. Compared with 1,021 control ward admissions, overtriaged admissions had similar outcomes but higher costs ($15.9K [interquartile range $9.8K to $22.3K] vs $10.7K [$7.0K to $17.6K], p < 0.001) and lower value of care (0.2 [0.1 to 0.3] vs 1.5 [0.9 to 2.2], p < 0.001). Among 8,594 ward admissions, 1,029 (12.0%) were undertriaged. Compared with 2,498 control ICU admissions, undertriaged admissions had longer hospital length-of-stays (6.4 [3.4 to 12.4] vs 5.4 [2.6 to 10.4] days, p < 0.001); greater incidence of hospital mortality (1.7% vs 0.7%, p = 0.03), cardiac arrest (1.4% vs 0.5%, p = 0.04), and persistent acute kidney injury without renal recovery (5.2% vs 2.8%, p = 0.002); similar costs ($21.8K [$13.3K to $34.9K] vs $21.9K [$13.1K to $36.3K]); and lower value of care (0.8 [0.5 to 1.3] vs 1.2 [0.7 to 2.0], p < 0.001).","866":"Results from this analysis can be used to direct national and well as cross-border targeting of interventions, over space, time and by sub-population. The results also highlight that collaboration between neighbouring countries is needed to tackle the importation of malaria at the regional level.As Swaziland progresses towards national malaria elimination, the importation of parasites into receptive areas becomes increasingly important. Imported infections have the potential to instigate local transmission and sustain local parasite reservoirs.Of 1517 confirmed cases identified through passive surveillance, 67% reported travel history. A large proportion of positive cases reported domestic or international travel history (65%) compared to negative cases (10%). The primary risk factor for malaria infection in Swaziland was shown to be travel, more specifically international travel to Mozambique by 25- to 44-year old males, who spent on average 28 nights away. Maputo City, Inhambane and Gaza districts were the most likely travel destinations in Mozambique, and 96% of RDT-positive international travellers were either Swazi (52%) or Mozambican (44%) nationals, with Swazis being more likely to test negative. All international travellers were unlikely to have a bed net at home or use protection of any type while travelling. Additionally, paths of transmission, important border crossings and means of transport were identified.Travel histories from Swaziland's routine surveillance data from January 2010 to June 2014 were extracted and analysed. The travel patterns and demographics of rapid diagnostic test (RDT)-confirmed positive cases identified through passive and reactive case detection (RACD) were analysed and compared to those found to be negative through RACD.","867":"The population of people living with HIV in South Africa is rapidly ageing due to increased survivorship attributable to antiretroviral therapy (ART). We sought to understand how the combined effects of HIV and ART have led to differences in healthy longevity by HIV status and viral suppression in this context.These results highlight the tremendous benefits of ART for population health in high-HIV-prevalence contexts and reinforce the need for continued work in making ART treatment accessible to ageing populations.National Institutes of Health.Among the 4322 eligible participants from the HAALSI study, we find a clear gradient in remaining life expectancy and DFLE based on HIV serostatus and viral suppression. At age 45 years, the life expectancy of a woman without HIV was 33\u00b72 years (95% CI 32\u00b70-35\u00b70), compared with 31\u00b76 years (29\u00b72-34\u00b71) a woman with virally suppressed HIV, and 26\u00b74 years (23\u00b71-29\u00b71) for a woman with unsuppressed HIV; life expectancy for a 45 year old man without HIV was 27\u00b72 years (25\u00b78-29\u00b71), compared with 24\u00b71 years (20\u00b79-27\u00b72) for a man with virally suppressed HIV, and 17\u00b74 years (15\u00b70-20\u00b73) for a man with unsuppressed HIV. Men and women with viral suppression could expect to live nearly as many years of DFLE as HIV-uninfected individuals at ages 45 years and 65 years.In this observational cohort modelling study we use longitudinal data from the 2015 baseline interview (from Nov 13, 2014, to Nov 30, 2015) and the 2018 longitudinal follow-up interview (from Oct 12, 2018, to Nov 7, 2019) of the population-based study Health and Ageing in Africa: a Longitudinal Study of an INDEPTH Community in South Africa (HAALSI) to estimate life expectancy and disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) of adults aged 40 years and older in rural South Africa. Respondents who consented to HIV testing, responded to survey questions on disability, and who were either interviewed in both surveys or who died between survey waves were included in the analysis. We estimate life expectancy and DFLE by HIV status and viral suppression (defined as <200 copies per mL) using Markov-based microsimulation.","868":" Here, we use simulation methods to examine how two features of the degree distribution affect network connectivity: Mean degree captures a volume dimension, while the skewness of the upper tail captures a shape dimension. We find a clear interaction between shape and volume: When mean degree is low, connectivity is greater for long-tailed distributions, but at higher mean degree, connectivity is greater in short-tailed distributions. The phase transition to a giant component and giant bicomponent emerges as a positive function of volume, but it rises more sharply and ultimately reaches more people in short-tail distributions than in long-tail distributions. These findings suggest that any interventions should be attuned to how practices affect both the volume and shape of the degree distribution, noting potential unanticipated effects. For example, policies that primarily affect high-volume nodes may not be effective if they simply redistribute volume among lower degree actors, which appears to exacerbate underlying network connectivity.","869":"The output of the algorithm as applied to epidemiological time series related to COVID-19 corresponds to visual intuition and expert opinion. Inspecting the results of individual countries shows how consecutive observed waves can differ greatly with respect to the case fatality ratio. Furthermore, in large countries, a more detailed analysis shows that consecutive observed waves have different geographical ranges. We also show how waves can be modulated by government interventions and find that early implementation of NPIs correlates with a reduced number of observed waves and reduced mortality burden in those waves.A discussion of 'waves' of the COVID-19 epidemic in different countries is a part of the national conversation for many, but there is no hard and fast means of delineating these waves in the available data and their connection to waves in the sense of mathematical epidemiology is only tenuous.We present an algorithm which processes a general time series to identify substantial, significant and sustained periods of increase in the value of the time series, which could reasonably be described as 'observed waves'. This provides an objective means of describing observed waves in time series. We use this method to synthesize evidence across different countries to study types, drivers and modulators of waves.It is possible to identify observed waves of disease by algorithmic methods and the results can be fruitfully used to analyse the progression of the epidemic.","870":"We compare different weights in a simulation study. Weights are obtained from the proportion of participating labs over all labs. We adjust these weights for attractiveness and density of labs over population. The market share of sentinel labs, as estimated by the econometric Huff-model, is also considered. Additionally, we investigate the effect of not recognizing sentinel labs as sentinel labs when they report no cases. We estimate the bias associated with the different weights as the difference between the simulated number of cases and the estimate of this total from the sentinel sample. As motivating data examples, we apply an extended Huff-model to four pathogens under laboratory sentinel surveillance in Belgium between 2010 and 2015 and discuss the model fit. We estimate the total number of lab-confirmed cases associated with Rotavirus, influenza virus, Y. enterocolitica and Campylobacter spp.. The extended Huff-model takes the lab-concept, the number of reimbursements and the number of departments, lab-density, regional borders, distance and competition between labs in account.Inverse probability weighting (IPW) methods can be used to estimate the total number of cases from the sample collected through sentinel surveillance. Central to these methods are the inverse weights which can be derived in several ways and, in this case, represent the probability that laboratory (lab) sentinel surveillance detects a lab-confirmed case.Estimates obtained with the Huff-model were most accurate in the more complex simulation scenarios as compared to other weights. In the data examples, several significant coefficients are identified, but the fit of the Huff-model to the Belgian sentinel surveillance data leaves much variability in market shares unexplained.The Huff-model allows for estimation of the spatial and population coverage of sentinel surveillance and through IPW-methods also for the estimation of the total number of cases. The Huff-model's gravity function allows us to differentiate inside an area while estimating from the full dataset. Our data examples show that additional data on the participation to surveillance and practices of labs is necessary for a more accurate estimation.","871":"Research and innovation have been fundamental to many of the successes in immunization thus far, and will play important roles in the future success of Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030). Strategic Priority 7 (SP7) of IA2030, which addresses research and innovation, is explicitly informed by country needs and priorities, and aims to strengthen the innovation ecosystem through capacity building and collaboration at country, regional, and global levels. SP7 identifies four key focus areas: (1) \"needs-based innovation\", (2) \"new and improved products, services, and practices\", (3) \"evidence for implementation\", and (4) \"local capacity\". Strategic interventions in these key focus areas apply the lessons of the Global Vaccine Action Plan and the \"Decade of Vaccines\" to emphasize local innovation, promote the use of research by countries to improve program performance and impact, and encourage capacity building for the development and implementation of innovations. The proposed approach will maintain a focus on the development of new vaccines and the improvement of existing vaccines, and increase attention to innovation in service delivery. Monitoring and evaluation will foster evidence-based priority setting at the country level and help to ground the global research and development (R&D) agenda in the needs of communities. Together, these approaches are intended to harness the power of research and innovation more effectively, to meet the challenges of the future and achieve the ambitious goals of IA2030.","872":" area in western Madagascar-three lemur and three non-primate species-that consider genetic, dietary, and ecological predictors of microbiome functionality and composition.

In this study, we aim to examine the associated risk factors for COVID-19 infection among HCWs in North-East Nigeria. We used data collected retrospectively among a cohort of clinical and non-clinical HCWs in six healthcare facilities in Adamawa State, Nigeria. We estimated the marginal probability of COVID-19 infection among HWCs using alternating logistic regression via the generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach. Among the 318 HCWs, 178 (55.97%) were males, mean (\u00b1SD) age was 36.81 (\u00b18.98), 237 (74.76%) were clinical, and 80 (25.24) were non-clinical staff. The overall prevalence of COVID-19 was 16.67% among HCWs. After adjusting for other variables in the model, our results showed that clinical staff had a 5-fold higher risk of COVID-19 infection than non-clinical staff (aOR = 5.07, 95% CI: 1.32-19.52). Moreover, significant exposure risk factors for COVID-19 infection for HCWs increase with age, time spent attending to patients, caring for COVID-19 patients, and having worked with COVID-19 samples, while the risk decreases with the use of an N95 mask. Our findings suggested that the burden of COVID-19 infection is higher for clinical staff than non-clinical staff, and increasing age contributed to the increased risk.","874":"Across the three seasons, 16,342 subjects were included in the analyses. For 2015\/16, frequentist and Bayesian VE estimates were essentially identical (41% each). For 2017\/18, frequentist and Bayesian estimates of VE against A(H3N2) viruses were also nearly identical (26% vs. 23%, respectively), even though the presence of apparent antigenic match could potentially have pulled Bayesian estimates upward. Precision of estimates was similar between methods in both seasons. Frequentist and Bayesian estimates diverged for children in 2013\/14. Under the frequentist approach, LAIV effectiveness was 62 percentage points lower than IIV, while LAIV was only 27 percentage points lower than IIV under the Bayesian approach.Routine influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) surveillance networks use frequentist methods to estimate VE. With data from more than a decade of VE surveillance from diverse global populations now available, using Bayesian methods to explicitly account for this knowledge may be beneficial. This study explores differences between Bayesian vs. frequentist inference in multiple seasons with varying VE.We used data from the United States Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (US Flu VE) Network. Ambulatory care patients with acute respiratory illness were enrolled during seasons of varying observed VE based on traditional frequentist methods. We estimated VE against A(H1N1)pdm in 2015\/16, dominated by A(H1N1)pdm; against A(H3N2) in 2017\/18, dominated by A(H3N2); and compared VE for live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) vs. inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) among children aged 2-17\u2009years in 2013\/14, also dominated by A(H1N1)pdm. VE was estimated using both frequentist and Bayesian methods using the test-negative design. For the Bayesian estimates, prior VE distributions were based on data from all published test-negative studies of the same influenza type\/subtype available prior to the season of interest.Bayesian estimates of influenza VE can differ from frequentist estimates to a clinically meaningful degree when VE diverges substantially from previous seasons.","875":"Since the first case of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in South Korea was confirmed on January 20, 2020, there have been 24 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV. The majority of these cases (58.3%; n=14) were male, with a median age of 42 years (range, 21-62 years). Of the confirmed cases, 15 were index cases (63%), six were first-generation patients (24%), and three were second-generation patients (12.5%). All the first- and second-generation patients were family members or close acquaintances of index cases. All the index cases entered the South Korea from January 19 to 24, 2020. The average incubation period was 3.6 days (median, 4 days) and the reproduction number (R0) was calculated as 0.5. Two of the confirmed cases were asymptomatic. As of February 8, 22 patients with 2019-nCoV are hospitalized in South Korea, and 2 have been discharged from the hospital. The epidemiological indicators will be revised as new information becomes available in the future. Sharing epidemiological information among researchers around the world is essential for efficient preparations and responses to new infectious diseases.","876":"Our understanding of ecological processes is built on patterns inferred from data. Applying modern analytical tools such as machine learning to increasingly high dimensional data offers the potential to expand our perspectives on these processes, shedding new light on complex ecological phenomena such as pathogen transmission in wild populations. Here, we propose a novel approach that combines data mining with theoretical models of disease dynamics. Using rodents as an example, we incorporate statistical differences in the life history features of zoonotic reservoir hosts into pathogen transmission models, enabling us to bound the range of dynamical phenomena associated with hosts, based on their traits. We then test for associations between equilibrium prevalence, a key epidemiological metric and data on human outbreaks of rodent-borne zoonoses, identifying matches between empirical evidence and theoretical predictions of transmission dynamics. We show how this framework can be generalized to other systems through a rubric of disease models and parameters that can be derived from empirical data. By linking life history components directly to their effects on disease dynamics, our mining-modelling approach integrates machine learning and theoretical models to explore mechanisms in the macroecology of pathogen transmission and their consequences for spillover infection to humans.","877":"Internet-based search engine and social media data may reflect the occurrence of clinically diagnosed conjunctivitis, suggesting that these data sources can be leveraged to better understand the epidemiologic factors of conjunctivitis.Data from encounters of 4143 patients diagnosed with conjunctivitis from June 3, 2012, to April 26, 2014, at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Medical Center, were analyzed using Spearman rank correlation of each weekly observation to compare demographics and seasonality of nonallergic conjunctivitis with allergic conjunctivitis. Data for patient encounters with diagnoses for glaucoma and influenza were also obtained for the same period and compared with conjunctivitis. Temporal patterns of Twitter and Google web search data, geolocated to the United States and associated with these clinical diagnoses, were compared with the clinical encounters. The a priori hypothesis was that weekly internet-based searches and social media posts about conjunctivitis may reflect the true weekly clinical occurrence of conjunctivitis.To assess whether data from internet-based social media and search engines are associated with objective clinic-based diagnoses of conjunctivitis.Internet-based search engine and social media data may provide a novel complementary source for better understanding the epidemiologic factors of infectious eye diseases, which could better inform eye health care and disease prevention.Seasonality of clinical diagnoses of nonallergic conjunctivitis among the 4143 patients (2364 females [57.1%] and 1776 males [42.9%]) with 5816 conjunctivitis encounters at UCSF correlated strongly with results of Google searches in the United States for the term pink eye (\u03c1, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.52 to 0.78]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and correlated moderately with Twitter results about pink eye (\u03c1, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.16 to 0.56]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and with clinical diagnosis of influenza (\u03c1, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.12 to 0.49]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), but did not significantly correlate with seasonality of clinical diagnoses of allergic conjunctivitis diagnosis at UCSF (\u03c1, 0.21 [95% CI, -0.02 to 0.42]; P\u2009=\u2009.06) or with results of Google searches in the United States for the term eye allergy (\u03c1, 0.13 [95% CI, -0.06 to 0.32]; P\u2009=\u2009.19). Seasonality of clinical diagnoses of allergic conjunctivitis at UCSF correlated strongly with results of Google searches in the United States for the term eye allergy (\u03c1, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.24 to 0.60]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and eye drops (\u03c1, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.27 to 0.62]; P\u2009<\u2009.001).Weekly total clinical diagnoses at UCSF of nonallergic conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, glaucoma, and influenza were compared using Spearman rank correlation with equivalent weekly data on Tweets related to disease or disease-related keyword searches obtained from Google Trends.","878":"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers have proposed risk metrics, such as the CDC Community Levels, to guide local and state decision-making. However, risk metrics have not reliably predicted key outcomes and have often lacked transparency in terms of prioritization of false-positive versus false-negative signals. They have also struggled to maintain relevance over time due to slow and infrequent updates addressing new variants and shifts in vaccine- and infection-induced immunity. We make two contributions to address these weaknesses. We first present a framework to evaluate predictive accuracy based on policy targets related to severe disease and mortality, allowing for explicit preferences toward false-negative versus false-positive signals. This approach allows policymakers to optimize metrics for specific preferences and interventions. Second, we propose a method to update risk thresholds in real time. We show that this adaptive approach to designating areas as \"high risk\" improves performance over static metrics in predicting 3-wk-ahead mortality and intensive care usage at both state and county levels. We also demonstrate that with our approach, using only new hospital admissions to predict 3-wk-ahead mortality and intensive care usage has performed consistently as well as metrics that also include cases and inpatient bed usage. Our results highlight that a key challenge for COVID-19 risk prediction is the changing relationship between indicators and outcomes of policy interest. Adaptive metrics therefore have a unique advantage in a rapidly evolving pandemic context.","879":"Detecting the temporally and spatially varying correlations is important to understand the biological and disease systems. Here we proposed a geographically weighted temporally correlated logistic regression (GWTCLR) model to identify such dynamic correlation of predictors on binomial outcome data, by incorporating spatial and temporal information for joint inference. The local likelihood method is adopted to estimate the spatial relationship, while the smoothing method is employed to estimate the temporal variation. We present the construction and implementation of GWTCLR and the study of the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator. Simulation studies were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the proposed model. GWTCLR was applied on real epidemiologic data to study the climatic determinants of human seasonal influenza epidemics. Our method obtained results largely consistent with previous studies but also revealed certain spatial and temporal varying patterns that were unobservable by previous models and methods.","880":"Although dialysis patients are at a high risk of death, it is difficult for medical practitioners to simultaneously evaluate many inter-related risk factors. In this study, we evaluated the characteristics of hemodialysis patients using machine learning model, and its usefulness for screening hemodialysis patients at a high risk of one-year death using the nation-wide database of the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy.The patients were separated into two datasets (n = 39,930, 39,930, respectively). We categorized hemodialysis patients in Japan into new clusters generated by the K-means clustering method using the development dataset. The association between a cluster and the risk of death was evaluated using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. Then, we developed an ensemble model composed of the clusters and support vector machine models in the model development phase, and compared the accuracy of the prediction of mortality between the machine learning models in the model validation phase.Average age of the subjects was 65.7\u00b112.2 years; 32.7% had diabetes mellitus. The five clusters clearly distinguished the groups on the basis of their characteristics: Cluster 1, young male, and chronic glomerulonephritis; Cluster 2, female, and chronic glomerulonephritis; Cluster 3, diabetes mellitus; Cluster 4, elderly and nephrosclerosis; Cluster 5, elderly and protein energy wasting. These clusters were associated with the risk of death; Cluster 5 compared with Cluster 1, hazard ratio 8.86 (95% CI 7.68, 10.21). The accuracy of the ensemble model for the prediction of 1-year death was 0.948 and higher than those of logistic regression model (0.938), support vector machine model (0.937), and deep learning model (0.936).The clusters clearly categorized patient on their characteristics, and reflected their prognosis. Our real-world-data-based machine learning system is applicable to identifying high-risk hemodialysis patients in clinical settings, and has a strong potential to guide treatments and improve their prognosis.","881":"Most of previous studies investigated the optimal control of HIV infection at either within-host or between-host level. However, the optimal treatment strategy for the individual may not be optimal for the population and vice versa. To determine when the two-level optimal controls are in accord or conflict, we develop a multi-scale model using various functions that link the viral load within host and the transmission rate between hosts, calibrated by cohort data. We obtain the within-host optimal treatment scheme that minimizes the viral load and maximizes the count of healthy cells at the individual level, and the coupled optimal scheme that minimizes the basic reproduction number at the population level. Mathematical analysis shows that whether the two-level optimal controls coincide depends on the sign of the product of their switching functions. Numerical results suggest that they are in accord for a high maximal drug efficacy but may conflict for a low drug efficacy. Using the multi-scale model, we also identify a threshold of the treatment effectiveness that determines how early treatment initiation can affect the disease dynamics among population. These results may help develop a synergistic treatment protocol beneficial to both HIV-infected individuals and the whole population.","882":"The dynamics underlying fisheries stock\u0096recruitment relationships are often obscure, especially with relatively short-lived invertebrate species, such as the brown shrimp Farfantepenaeus aztecus. Nonetheless, disentangling these dynamics can help to reveal optimal management strategies for long-term sustainability. We developed a matrix model to link early shrimp life history with the fishable stock and nested the degree of density-dependent settler (i.e., juvenile) survival in a Beverton\u0096Holt framework. Density dependence in the settler stage was assumed to have an inverse relationship with marsh habitat availability. Thus, we could determine the level of potential compensation in the settler stage and compare how changes in habitat versus fishing pressure could ultimately affect Louisiana\u0092s brown shrimp population. A simplified Bayesian state-space (i.e., hierarchical) model provided a theoretical framework for estimating density dependence and exploring how substantial increases in catch or density-dependent settler survival affected long-term abundance in all stages. At the baseline degree of density-dependent settler survival, which was estimated from observed CPUE data, the brown shrimp population was largely resilient to even a twofold increase in catch. However, a 50% loss of habitat had deleterious effects on brown shrimp abundances in all stages. Results highlight the importance of protecting and restoring important nursery habitat to maintain and enhance resiliency of the brown shrimp fishery.","883":"Household exposure remains a major driver of incident TB risk among household contacts of identified TB cases. Targeting interventions on these individuals is likely to prevent more cases of TB than blanket screening of individuals in the community.We conducted a population-based prospective cohort study within households of TB cases in Lima. We identified all adults diagnosed with incident pulmonary TB from 2009 through 2012 at 106 participating public health centres (HC) within our catchment area of \u223c3.3 million inhabitants. We estimated combined effects of community and household exposure on the risk of latent TB infection (LTBI) and incident TB disease. We used simulation modelling to assess the efficacy of TB screening programmes for reducing the risk of incident TB in these contacts.Individuals with household exposure to TB are more likely to present with LTBI and TB disease than those without this exposure, despite wide variation in community exposure. Simulations suggest that more cases are prevented by 1000 administrations of IPT to tuberculin skin test (TST)-positive household contacts of identified TB cases (30, 95% CI\u2009=\u200916,47) than from blanket screening and treatment in the community (7, 95% CI\u2009=\u20092,17).Untargeted active screening and treatment programmes for tuberculosis (TB) have not been shown to be more effective than passive screening and isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) for reducing TB incidence. In this manuscript, we compare the efficacy of targeting screening and IPT on high-risk household contacts of diagnosed TB cases, with less-targeted active screening approaches in Lima, Peru.","884":"What can modelers learn from recent history to help prepare for the next pandemic?","885":"Natural selection theory suggests that mobile animals trade off time, energy and risk costs with food, safety and other pay-offs obtained by movement. We examined how birds make movement decisions by integrating aspects of flight biomechanics, movement ecology and behaviour in a hierarchical framework investigating flight track variation across several spatio-temporal scales. Using extensive global positioning system and accelerometer data from Eurasian griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) in Israel and France, we examined soaring-gliding decision-making by comparing inbound versus outbound flights (to or from a central roost, respectively), and these (and other) home-range foraging movements (up to 300 km) versus long-range movements (longer than 300 km). We found that long-range movements and inbound flights have similar features compared with their counterparts: individuals reduced journey time by performing more efficient soaring-gliding flight, reduced energy expenditure by flapping less and were more risk-prone by gliding more steeply between thermals. Age, breeding status, wind conditions and flight altitude (but not sex) affected time and energy prioritization during flights. We therefore suggest that individuals facing time, energy and risk trade-offs during movements make similar decisions across a broad range of ecological contexts and spatial scales, presumably owing to similarity in the uncertainty about movement outcomes.This article is part of the themed issue 'Moving in a moving medium: new perspectives on flight'.","886":"Myanmar is one of the 31 highest burden malaria countries worldwide. Scaling up the appropriate use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) is a national policy for malaria prevention and control. However, the data on use, influencing factors and maintenance of bed nets is still lack among the population in Kachin Special Region II (KR2), Northeastern Myanmar.The study combined a quantitative household questionnaire survey and qualitative direct observation of households. A Chi-squared test was used to compare the percentages of ownership, coverage, and rates of use of bed nets. Additionally, multivariate logistic regression analysis (MVLRA) was used to analyse factors that influence the use of bed nets. Finally, covariance compared the mean calibrated hole indexes (MCHI) across potential influence variables.The bed net to person ratio was 1:1.96 (i.e., more than one net for every two people). The long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) to person ratio was 1: 2.52. Also, the percentage of households that owned at least one bed net was 99.7% (666\/688). Some 3262 (97.3%) residents slept under bed nets the prior night, 2551 (76.1%) of which slept under ITNs\/LLINs the prior night (SUITNPN). The poorest families, those with thatched roofing, those who use agriculture as their main source of family income, household heads who knew that mosquitoes transmit malaria and those who used bed nets to prevent malaria, were significantly more likely to be in the SUITNPN group. However, residents in lowlands, and foothills were significantly less likely to be SUITNPNs. Finally, head of household attitude towards fixing bed nets influenced MCHI (F=8.09, P=0.0046).The coverage and usage rates of bed nets were high, especially among children, and pregnant women. Family wealth index, geographical zones, household roofing, source of family income, household head's knowledge of malaria transmission and of using bed nets as tools for malaria prevention are all independent factors which influence use of ITNs\/LLINs in KR2. Maintaining high coverage, and use rate of bed nets should be a priority for the war-torn population of KR2 to ensure equity and human rights.","887":"The first SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) to be designated was lineage B.1.1.7, later labelled by the World Health Organization as Alpha. Originating in early autumn but discovered in December 2020, it spread rapidly and caused large waves of infections worldwide. The Alpha variant is notable for being defined by a long ancestral phylogenetic branch with an increased evolutionary rate, along which only two sequences have been sampled. Alpha genomes comprise a well-supported monophyletic clade within which the evolutionary rate is typical of SARS-CoV-2. The Alpha epidemic continued to grow despite the continued restrictions on social mixing across the UK and the imposition of new restrictions, in particular, the English national lockdown in November 2020. While these interventions succeeded in reducing the absolute number of cases, the impact of these non-pharmaceutical interventions was predominantly to drive the decline of the SARS-CoV-2 lineages that preceded Alpha. We investigate the only two sampled sequences that fall on the branch ancestral to Alpha. We find that one is likely to be a true intermediate sequence, providing information about the order of mutational events that led to Alpha. We explore alternate hypotheses that can explain how Alpha acquired a large number of mutations yet remained largely unobserved in a region of high genomic surveillance: an under-sampled geographical location, a non-human animal population, or a chronically infected individual. We conclude that the latter provides the best explanation of the observed behaviour and dynamics of the variant, although the individual need not be immunocompromised, as persistently infected immunocompetent hosts also display a higher within-host rate of evolution. Finally, we compare the ancestral branches and mutation profiles of other VOCs and find that Delta appears to be an outlier both in terms of the genomic locations of its defining mutations and a lack of the rapid evolutionary rate on its ancestral branch. As new variants, such as Omicron, continue to evolve (potentially through similar mechanisms), it remains important to investigate the origins of other variants to identify ways to potentially disrupt their evolution and emergence.","888":"There have been notable advances in the development of vaccines against active tuberculosis (TB) disease for adults and adolescents. Using mathematical models, we seek to estimate the potential impact of a post-exposure TB vaccine, having 50% efficacy in reducing active disease, on global rifampicin-resistant (RR-) TB burden. In 30 countries that together accounted for 90% of global RR-TB incidence in 2018, a future TB vaccine could avert 10% (95% credible interval: 9.7-11%) of RR-TB cases and 7.3% (6.6-8.1%) of deaths over 2020-2035, with India, China, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the Russian Federation having the greatest contribution. This impact would increase to 14% (12-16%) and 31% (29-33%) respectively, when combined with improvements in RR-TB diagnosis and treatment relative to a scenario of no vaccine and no such improvements. A future TB vaccine could have important implications for the global control of RR-TB, especially if implemented alongside enhancements in management of drug resistance.","889":"This study aims to understand availability of school-based infectious disease surveillance data (e.g., COVID-19 cases, student absences) based on experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic using a national sample of public K-12 schools (n = 1,602). Based on surveys administered to school administrators throughout the 2021-2022 school year, we found high levels of missingness data for school-level COVID-19 cases, quarantines, and student absenteeism, increasing missingness over time, and variations in missingness by school characteristics (e.g., school size) and protocols (e.g., having a school-based system to report at-home COVID-19 tests). For the same sample of schools, using data requests to health departments, we found similarly high levels of missingness of school-level COVID-19 case data and varying approaches in data collection. Developing nationally standardized case definitions-and systems to surveil or collect and monitor school-based infectious disease outcomes early in a public health emergency-may be helpful in producing actionable data.","890":"To determine what people learned about the COVID-19 pandemic through \"web search;\" examine any association between what people learned about COVID-19 and behavior towards the public health guidelines; and analyze the impact of misinformation and conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic on people's behavior towards public health measures.This paper undertakes an infodemiology study using the Google trends worldwide search index covering the first six months after the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (January 1st, to June 30th, 2020) when the public scrambled for information about the pandemic. Data analysis employed statistical trends, correlation and regression, principal component analysis, and predictive models.Several studies focus on the impacts of social media and related platforms on spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories. This study provides the first empirical evidence to the mainly anecdotal discourse on the use of web search to learn about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.(i). The principal components analysis identifies two latent variables comprising past coronavirus epidemics (pastCoVepidemics) and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (presCoVpandemic). Both principal components (PCs) were utilized significantly to learn about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and explained 88.78% variability. (ii). Three (3) PCs fuelled misinformation about COVID-19 [Misinformation(\"Biological Weapon,\" \"VirusHoax,\" \"CommonCold,\" \"COVID-19Hoax,\" \"ChinaVirus\"); ConspTheory1(\"@5G\"); ConspTheory1(\"IngestBleach\")]. These PCs explained 84.85% of the variability, (iii). Two (2) PCs identified two components of public health measures [PubHealthMes1(\"Social Distancing,\" \"WashHand,\" \"Isolation,\" \"Quarantine.\"); PubHealthMes2(\"WearMask\"), which explained 84.7% of the variability. (iv). Based on the PCA results, log-linear, and predictive models [ConspTheory1(@5G)] is identified as a predictor of people's behavior towards public health measures (PubHealthMes2). Although (r=0.83), (r=-0.11) for Misinformation(COVID-19Hoax, VirusHoax, CommonCold, and more) and ConspTheory2 (Ingestbleach), respectively, with PubHealthMes1(social dist, handwash, isolation, and more), both were not statistically significant with (p=0.267), (p=0.13), respectively.The use of the Internet and web-based platforms to obtain public health information and manage health-related issues has become widespread in this digital age. The practice is so pervasive that the first reaction to obtaining health information is to 'google it.' As SARS-CoV-2 broke out in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and quickly spread worldwide, people flocked to the Internet to learn about the novel coronavirus and the disease, COVID-19. Lagged response by governments and public health agencies to prioritize the Internet and the World Wide Web to disseminate information about the coronavirus outbreak and building trust gave room for others to quickly populate the social media, online blogs, news outlets, and websites with misinformation and conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in people's deviant behaviors towards public health safety measures.","891":" resistance mutations for ciprofloxacin and gepotidacin can be used to minimise the risk of resistance development to gepotidacin.MethodsWe use individual-based stochastic simulations to formally investigate the aim.ResultsThe level of testing needed to reduce the risk of resistance development depends on the mutation rate under treatment and the prevalence of stepping-stone mutations. A POCT is most effective if the mutation rate under antibiotic treatment is no more than two orders of magnitude above the mutation rate without treatment and the prevalence of stepping-stone mutations is 1-13%.ConclusionMutation frequencies and rates should be considered when estimating the POCT usage required to reduce the risk of resistance development in a given population. Molecular POCTs for resistance mutations and stepping-stone mutations to resistance are likely to become important tools in antibiotic stewardship.","892":"We conducted a retrospective nationwide cohort study utilizing the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) Research Database. A total of 65,124 CKD patients aged\u2009\u2265\u200960\u00a0years, who died in hospitals or shortly after discharge between 2002 and 2012 were analyzed. The primary outcomes were inpatient expenses and use of surgical interventions in the last 30\u00a0days of life. Utilization of intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, resuscitation, and dialysis was also examined in a sub-sample of 2072 patients with detailed prescription data. Multivariate log-linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to assess patient-, physician-, and facility-specific predictors and the potential impact of a 2009 payment policy to reimburse hospice care for non-cancer patients.Overall EOL costs and rates of intensive service use among older patients with CKD were high, with significant variability across various patient and provider characteristics. Several opportunities exist for providers and policy makers to reduce costs and enhance the value of EOL care for this population.During the last 30\u00a0days of life, average inpatients costs for elderly CKD patients were approximately US$10,260, with 40.9% receiving surgical interventions, 40.2% experiencing ICU admission, 45.3% undergoing mechanical ventilation, 14.7% receiving resuscitation and 42.0% receiving dialysis. Significant variability was observed in the inpatient costs and use of intensive services. Costs were lower among individuals with the following characteristics: advanced age; high income; high Charlson Comorbidity Index scores; treatment by older physicians, nephrologists, and family medicine physicians; and treatment at local hospitals. Similar findings were obtained for the use of surgical interventions and other intensive services. A declining trend was detected in the costs of EOL care, use of surgical interventions and resuscitation between 2009 and 2012, which is consistent with the impact of a 2009 NHI payment policy to reimburse non-cancer hospice care.Despite the urgent need for evidence to guide the end-of-life (EOL) care for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), we have limited knowledge of the costs and intensity of EOL care in this population. The present study examined patterns and predictors for EOL care intensity among elderly patients with CKD.","893":" diagnostic test. Vaccine safety was assessed after all three vaccinations to quantify the number and severity of adverse events. Vaccinated animals had an adverse event rate of 3.09%, whereas placebo animals had 0.68%. Receiving vaccine was correlated with the occurrence of mild, site-specific, reactions. Occurrence of severe adverse events was not associated with having received vaccine. Infected, asymptomatic animals did not have a higher rate of adverse events. Use of vaccination is, therefore, likely to be safe in infected, asymptomatic animals.","894":"The shift from a hunter-gatherer to an agricultural mode of subsistence is believed to have been associated with profound changes in the burden and diversity of pathogens across human populations. Yet, the extent to which the advent of agriculture affected the evolution of the human immune system remains unknown. Here we present a comparative study of variation in the transcriptional responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to bacterial and viral stimuli between Batwa rainforest hunter-gatherers and Bakiga agriculturalists from Uganda. We observed increased divergence between hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists in the early transcriptional response to viruses compared with that for bacterial stimuli. We demonstrate that a significant fraction of these transcriptional differences are under genetic control and we show that positive natural selection has helped to shape population differences in immune regulation. Across the set of genetic variants underlying inter-population immune-response differences, however, the signatures of positive selection were disproportionately observed in the rainforest hunter-gatherers. This result is counter to expectations on the basis of the popularized notion that shifts in pathogen exposure due to the advent of agriculture imposed radically heightened selective pressures in agriculturalist populations.","895":"Constitutive models for biological tissue are typically formulated as a mixture of constituents and the overall response is then assembled by superposition or compatibility. This ensures the stress response of the biological tissue to be in the range of a given constitutive relationship, guaranteeing that at least one parameter combination exists so that an experimental response can be sufficiently well captured. Another, perhaps more challenging, problem is to use constitutive models as a proxy to infer the structure\/function of a biological tissue from experiments. In other words, we determine the optimal set of parameters by solving an inverse problem and use these parameters to infer the integrity of the tissue constituents. In previous studies, we focused on the mechanical stress-stretch response of the murine patellar tendon at various age and healing timepoints and solved the inverse problem using three constitutive models, i.e., the Freed-Rajagopal, Gasser-Ogden-Holzapfel and Shearer in order of increasing microstructural detail. Herein, we extend this work by adopting a Bayesian perspective on parameter estimation and implement the constitutive relations in the tulip library for uncertainty analysis, critically analyzing parameter marginals, correlations, identifiability and sensitivity. Our results show the importance of investigating the variability of parameter estimates and that results from optimization may be misleading, particularly for models with many parameters inferred from limited experimental evidence. In our study, we show that different age and healing conditions do not correspond to statistically significant separation among the Gasser-Ogden-Holzapfel and Shearer model parameters, while the phenomenological Freed-Rajagopal model is instead characterized by better indentifiability and parameter learning. Use of the complete experimental observations rather than averaged stress-stretch responses appears to positively constrain inference and results appear to be invariant with respect to the scaling of the experimental uncertainty.","896":"Pesticides have been frequently detected in global freshwater ecosystems, but attempts to document changes in population dynamics of organisms upon exposure to pesticides, establish a causal relationship between exposure and population effects, and identify the key toxic events within individuals under natural field conditions remain rare. Here, we used a field survey, a reciprocal cross-transplant experiment, and a laboratory toxicity experiment to build a compelling case that exposure to the insecticide chlorpyrifos was responsible for differences in snail (Bellamya aeruginosa) densities in eastern (ELL) and western basins of Liangzi Lake in China. Our field survey and reciprocal cross-transplant experiment revealed significant differences in snail densities, juvenile percentage, survival, and relative telomere length (RTL) in the two basins. The insecticide chlorpyrifos detected in snail tissues was negatively correlated with snail densities, the percentage of juvenile snails, and RTL and had an extremely high risk quotient in ELL. In the laboratory experiment, tissue concentrations of chlorpyrifos detected in ELL were associated with reduced RTL and increased juvenile mortality in B. aeruginosa. These results support the hypothesis that chlorpyrifos exposure in ELL reduced the density of snails by reducing juvenile survival and, consequently, recruitment to the adult population.","897":"This study aimed to develop a dynamic readmission risk prediction model that yields daily predictions for patients hospitalized with heart failure toward identifying risk trajectories over time and identifying clinical predictors associated with different patterns in readmission risk trajectories.Patients hospitalized with heart failure suffer the highest rates of 30-day readmission among other clinically defined patient populations in the United States. Investigation into the predictability of 30-day readmissions can lead to clinical decision support tools and targeted interventions that can help care providers to improve individual patient care and reduce readmission risk.Dynamically predicting readmission and quantifying trends over patients' hospital stay illuminated differing risk trajectory groups. Identifying risk trajectory patterns and distinguishing predictors may shed new light on indicators of readmission and the isolated effects of the index hospitalization.A two-stage predictive modeling approach combining logistic and beta regression was applied to electronic health record data accumulated daily to predict 30-day readmission for 534 hospital encounters of patients with heart failure over 2750 patient days. Unsupervised clustering was performed on predictions to uncover time-dependent trends in readmission risk over the patient's hospital stay. We used data collected between September 1, 2013, and August 31, 2015, from a community hospital in Maryland (United States) for patients with a primary diagnosis of heart failure. Patients who died during the hospital stay or were transferred to other acute care hospitals or hospice care were excluded.Readmission occurred in 107 (107\/534, 20.0%) encounters. The out-of-sample area under curve for the 2-stage predictive model was 0.73 (SD 0.08). Dynamic clinical predictors capturing laboratory results and vital signs had the highest predictive value compared with demographic, administrative, medical, and procedural data included. Unsupervised clustering identified four risk trajectory groups: decreasing risk (131\/534, 24.5% encounters), high risk (113\/534, 21.2%), moderate risk (177\/534, 33.1%), and low risk (113\/534, 21.2%). The decreasing risk group demonstrated change in average probability of readmission from admission (0.69) to discharge (0.30), whereas the high risk (0.75), moderate risk (0.61), and low risk (0.39) groups maintained consistency over the hospital course. A higher level of hemoglobin, larger decrease in potassium and diastolic blood pressure from admission to discharge, and smaller number of past hospitalizations are associated with decreasing readmission risk (P<.001).","898":"Control of gambiense sleeping sickness relies predominantly on passive and active screening of people, followed by treatment.Mathematical modeling explores the potential of 3 complementary interventions in high- and low-transmission settings.There was general model consensus in the ranking of the 3 complementary interventions studied, although with discrepancies between the quantitative predictions due to differing epidemiological assumptions within the models. While these predictions provide generic insights into improving control, the most effective strategy in any situation depends on the specific epidemiology in the region and the associated costs.Intervention strategies that included vector control are predicted to halt transmission most quickly. Targeted active screening, with better and more focused coverage, and enhanced passive surveillance, with improved access to diagnosis and treatment, are both estimated to avert many new infections but, when used alone, are unlikely to halt transmission before 2030 in high-risk settings.","899":"IPD began to return towards baseline values among children 0 to 4 years old in April 2021 and exceeded baseline levels by June 2021 (a 9% increase over the average monthly values for 2015-2019). Children 5 to 14, adults aged 15-34 and adults 80 years and older showed increases in IPD cases which went over baseline values starting in July 2021, with increases also starting in Spring 2021. The age distribution and proportion of vaccine serotype IPD remained comparable to previous years despite lower overall case counts in 2020 and 2021. The percent change in IPD incidence compared to the previous five years correlated with changes in mobility and with NPI stringency.The incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) decreased worldwide in 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, concurrent with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) intended to stymie transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In 2021, stringency of these NPI strategies has varied. We investigated age- and serotype-specific variations in IPD case counts in Germany in 2020-2021.IPD cases through November 30, 2021 were stratified by age group, serotype, or geographic location. IPD surveillance data in 2020-2021 were compared with: 1) IPD surveillance data from 2015-2019, 2) mobility data during 2020 and 2021, and 3) NPI stringency data in 2020 and 2021.IPD levels began to return to and exceed seasonal levels in Spring\/Summer 2021 in Germany following sharp declines in 2020 that coincided with NPIs related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Proportions of vaccine serotypes remained largely consistent throughout 2020-2021.","900":"Although the infection rate was lower in single-occupancy rooms (10%) than in multiple-occupancy rooms (19%), interroommate transmission occurred only about 20% of the time. Cases were usually asymptomatic at the time of detection. Notably, individuals who likely transmitted had an average viral load approximately 6.5-fold higher than individuals who did not (mean quantification cycle [Cq], 26.2 vs 28.9). Although students with diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection moved to isolation rooms, there was no difference in time to isolation between cases with or without interroommate transmission.Given high residence hall student density, the University of Colorado Boulder established a mandatory weekly screening test program. We analyzed longitudinal data from 6408 students and identified 116 likely transmission events in which a second roommate tested positive within 14 days of the index roommate.This analysis argues that interroommate transmission occurs infrequently in residence halls and provides strong correlative evidence that viral load is proportional to transmission probability.The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic spread to >200 countries in <6 months. To understand coronavirus spread, determining transmission rate and defining factors that increase transmission risk are essential. Most cases are asymptomatic, but people with asymptomatic infection have viral loads indistinguishable from those in symptomatic people, and they do transmit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, asymptomatic cases are often undetected.","901":"Stress fibers are actomyosin bundles that regulate cellular mechanosensation and force transduction. Interacting with the extracellular matrix through focal adhesion complexes, stress fibers are highly dynamic structures regulated by\u00a0myosin motors and crosslinking proteins. Under external mechanical stimuli such as tensile forces, the stress fiber remodels its architecture to adapt to external cues, displaying properties of viscoelastic materials. How the structural remodeling of stress fibers is related to the generation of contractile force is not well understood. In this work, we simulate mechanochemical dynamics and force generation of stress fibers using the molecular simulation platform MEDYAN. We model stress fiber as two connecting bipolar bundles attached at the ends to focal adhesion complexes. The simulated stress fibers generate contractile force that is regulated by myosin motors and [Formula: see text]-actinin crosslinkers. We find that stress fibers enhance contractility by reducing the distance between actin filaments to increase crosslinker binding, and this structural remodeling ability depends on the crosslinker turnover rate. Under tensile pulling force, the stress fiber shows an instantaneous increase of the contractile forces followed by a slow relaxation into a new steady state. While the new steady state contractility after pulling depends only on the overlap between actin bundles, the short-term contractility enhancement is sensitive to the tensile pulling distance. We further show that this mechanical response is also sensitive to the crosslinker turnover rate. Our results provide new insights into the stress fiber mechanics that have significant implications for understanding cellular adaptation to mechanical signaling.","902":"In order to combat the growing problems associated with biological invasions, many researchers have focused on identifying which communities are most vulnerable to invasion by exotic species. However, once established, invasive species can significantly change the composition of the communities that they invade. The first step to disentangling the direction of causality is to discern whether a relationship with other vegetation exists at all. Carduus nutans and C. acanthoides are similar invasive thistles, which have caused substantial economic damage worldwide. We assessed the associations between the thistles and the standing flora in four sites in central Pennsylvania in which they co-occur. After sampling nearly 2000 plots of 1 m(2), we used partial Mantel tests to assess the differences in vegetation between thistle and non-thistle plots after accounting for location, and non-metric multidimensional scaling to visualize differences among plots and sites. We found significant differences in community composition in plots with and without Carduus thistles. The non-native species Sisymbrium officinale and Coronilla varia were consistently associated with the presence of Carduus thistles. Several species were associated with areas that were free of Carduus thistles, including an important non-native pasture species (Trifolium repens). We found no evidence for differences in composition between plots with C. nutans versus C. acanthoides, suggesting that they have similar associations with the vegetation community. We conclude that even at the within-field scale, areas invaded by Carduus thistles have different vegetation associations than uninvaded areas, allowing us to target future research about the role of vegetation structure in resisting and responding to invasion. ","903":"The goal of this chapter is to provide a brief overview of different types of malware that have been used to carry out cyber-attacks. In most cases, we will provide examples of each category of malware. Moreover, malware tends to be distributed in different ways and propagate in different ways. We will briefly explain how such malware propagates through the network. Finally, we will briefly describe a few specific malware attacks that nations may wish to guard against in the future.","904":"The aim of this study was to do determine the efficacy of the topical anaesthetic Tri-Solfen\u00ae in the amelioration of the pain of castration in piglets. The trial was conducted over a three day period, and blocked across six litters with 12 piglets treated on days one and two, and 16 on day three. The piglets were randomly allocated by weight and litter to 1 of 4 treatment groups: (i) sham castration (SHAM; n = 10); (ii) surgical castration with no anaesthetic intervention (CAST; n = 10); (iii) surgical castration with post-operative topical anaesthesia (TRI; n = 10); (iv) surgical castration with a pre-operative intra-testicular lignocaine hydrochloride injection (LIG; n = 10). Wound sensitivity testing involved von Frey monofilaments of weights 4g and 300g, and an 18 gauge needle, used to stimulate the wound and surrounding skin respectively, at various pre-determined sites. Neonatal piglets receiving topical anaesthesia (Tri-Solfen\u00ae) spray into castration wounds had significantly lower wound sensitivity responses for up to 4h, compared to those castrated following intra-testicular lignocaine injection or those with no treatment. The use of topical anaesthetic is suggested as a practical and affordable method of improving piglet welfare during castration.","905":"A total of 29,188 anomalies (12.4 per 1000 births) were recorded during the study period. Maternal exposure to extreme heat (> 95th percentile) was associated with higher risk of total anomalies, central nervous system anomalies, and other uncategorized anomalies with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.05 (95\u00a0% CI: 1.00, 1.11), 1.17 (95\u00a0% CI: 1.01, 1.37), and 1.16 (95\u00a0% CI: 1.04, 1.29) compared with minimum morbidity temperature, respectively. The associations were homogeneous across subgroups defined by maternal age, maternal race\/ethnicity, marital status, educational attainment, and parity, but were more pronounced among mothers residing in more socially vulnerable counties and births with multiple anomalies.Among US live singleton births, maternal exposure to ambient heat may be associated with higher risk of total anomalies, central nervous system anomalies, and other uncategorized anomalies. We suggest additional research is carried out to better understand the relations between maternal heat exposure and congenital anomalies in the presence of global warming.Maternal exposure to ambient heat may be associated with congenital anomalies, but evidence is still limited.We included data on 2,352,529 births with the first day of critical developmental windows falling within months of May through August from 2000 to 2004 across 525 US counties. We used a validated spatial-temporal model to estimate daily county-level population-weighted temperature. We used logistic regression to estimate the association between ambient temperature and risk of diagnostic categories of anomalies during the critical window after adjusting for individual and county-level factors. We conducted subgroup analysis to identify potential susceptible subpopulations.We aimed to estimate the association between maternal exposure to ambient heat during the 3-12\u00a0weeks post-conception (critical window of organogenesis) and risk of total and various diagnostic categories of major structural anomalies among live singleton births in the contiguous United States (US).","906":"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is thought to have emerged into the human population in Wuhan, China. The number of identified cases in Wuhan has increased rapidly since, and cases have been identified in other Chinese cities and other countries (as of 23 January 2020). We fitted a transmission model to reported case information up to 21 January to estimate key epidemiological measures, and to predict the possible course of the epidemic, as the potential impact of travel restrictions into and from Wuhan. We estimate the basic reproduction number of the infection (R_0) to be 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 3.6-4.0), indicating that 72-75% of transmissions must be prevented by control measures for infections to stop increasing. We estimate that only 5.1% (95%CI, 4.8-5.5) of infections in Wuhan are identified, and by 21 January a total of 11,341 people (prediction interval, 9,217-14,245) had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. Should the epidemic continue unabated in Wuhan, we predict the epidemic in Wuhan will be substantially larger by 4 February (191,529 infections; prediction interval, 132,751-273,649), infection will be established in other Chinese cities, and importations to other countries will be more frequent. Our model suggests that travel restrictions from and to Wuhan city are unlikely to be effective in halting transmission across China; with a 99% effective reduction in travel, the size of the epidemic outside of Wuhan may only be reduced by 24.9% on 4 February. Our findings are critically dependent on the assumptions underpinning our model, and the timing and reporting of confirmed cases, and there is considerable uncertainty associated with the outbreak at this early stage. With these caveats in mind, our work suggests that a basic reproductive number for this 2019-nCoV outbreak is higher compared to other emergent coronaviruses, suggesting that containment or control of this pathogen may be substantially more difficult.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementJMR acknowledges support from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EP\/N014499\/1) and the Medical Research Council (MR\/S004793\/1).

Fracture lines or sclerotic lines were noted in the IF lesion in 19 of 40 lesions on CT, and osteosclerosis was seen in 31 of 40 lesions. On WBS analysis, the sensitivity for detected lesions was 87.5% (42\/48) for WBS. Nineteen lesions were interpreted as benign, 6 lesions were malignant, and 21 (43.8%) lesions were equivocal. Based on the criterion standard, WBS had an accuracy of only 47.9% (23\/48). On SPECT\/CT analysis, all of the lesions were observed on SPECT\/CT; only 3 (6.25%) of 48 lesions were equivocal, and the accuracy was 89.6% (43\/48).This article presents a retrospective review of 35 patients with cervical cancer after radiotherapy in patients (females; mean age, 55.94 \u00b1 8.75 years; range, 36-73 years) who were referred to have WBS to determine whether there was any bone metastasis. The criterion standard was based on radiological investigations, clinical information, and follow-up at a minimum of 12 months.Single-photon emission computed tomography\/computed tomography should be included in the differential diagnoses when lesions show elevated technetium Tc 99m-labeled methylene diphosphonate uptake on WBS. Compared with a WBS alone, a more accurate diagnosis of IF can be obtained using SPECT\/CT, which resulted not only in fewer equivocal lesions but also in a higher diagnostic accuracy.Insufficiency fractures (IFs) are a type of stress fracture caused by the effects of normal or physiological stresses on abnormally weakened bone. Frequently, these fractures are occult, and a portion of these fractures is misdiagnosed as bone metastases on a whole-body bone scan (WBS). The aim of this study was to evaluate a potential benefit of single-photon emission computed tomography\/computed tomography (SPECT\/CT) with metabolic and morphological imaging to diagnose IF in patients with cervical cancer after radiotherapy.","908":"Influenza viruses may cause severe human infections leading to hospitalization or death. Linear regression models were fitted to population-based data on hospitalizations and deaths. Surveillance data on influenza virus activity permitted inference on influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths. The ratios of these estimates were used as a potential indicator of severity. Influenza was associated with 431 (95% CrI: 358-503) respiratory deaths and 12,700 (95% CrI: 11,700-13,700) respiratory hospitalizations per year. Majority of the excess deaths occurred in persons \u226565\u2009y of age. The ratios of deaths to hospitalizations in adults \u226565\u2009y were significantly higher for influenza A(H1N1) and A(H1N1)pdm09 compared to A(H3N2) and B. Substantial disease burden associated with influenza viruses were estimated in Hong Kong particularly among children and elderly in 1998-2013. Infections with influenza A(H1N1) was suggested to be more serious than A(H3N2) in older adults.","909":"Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) spread between hospitals, nursing homes (NHs), and long-term acute care facilities (LTACs) via patient transfers. The Shared Healthcare Intervention to Eliminate Life-threatening Dissemination of MDROs in Orange County is a regional public health collaborative involving decolonization at 38 healthcare facilities selected based on their high degree of patient sharing. We report baseline MDRO prevalence in 21 NHs\/LTACs.Prevalence of MDROs was 65% in NHs and 80% in LTACs. The most common MDROs in NHs were MRSA (42%) and ESBL (34%); in LTACs they were VRE (55%) and ESBL (38%). CRE prevalence was higher in facilities that manage ventilated LTAC patients and NH residents (8% vs <1%, P < .001). MDRO status was known for 18% of NH residents and 49% of LTAC patients. MDRO-colonized adults commonly harbored additional MDROs (54% MDRO+ NH residents and 62% MDRO+ LTACs patients). History of MRSA (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7; confidence interval [CI]: 1.2, 2.4; P = .004), VRE (OR = 2.1; CI: 1.2, 3.8; P = .01), ESBL (OR = 1.6; CI: 1.1, 2.3; P = .03), and diabetes (OR = 1.3; CI: 1.0, 1.7; P = .03) were associated with any MDRO carriage.The majority of NH residents and LTAC patients harbor MDROs. MDRO status is frequently unknown to the facility. The high MDRO prevalence highlights the need for prevention efforts in NHs\/LTACs as part of regional efforts to control MDRO spread.A random sample of 50 adults for 21 NHs\/LTACs (18 NHs, 3 LTACs) were screened for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. (VRE), extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase-producing organisms (ESBL), and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) using nares, skin (axilla\/groin), and peri-rectal swabs. Facility and resident characteristics associated with MDRO carriage were assessed using multivariable models clustering by person and facility.","910":"School based-measures such as school closure and school holidays have been considered a viable intervention during the hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) epidemic. The aim of this study was to explore the association of nationwide public health and social measures (PHSMs) including planned school vacation on the transmissibility and attack rate of the HFMD epidemic in South Korea.We found that school vacations and 2015 PHSMs were associated with the reduced Rt by 2-7 % and 13 %, respectively. Model projections indicated school vacations and 2015 PHSMs were associated with reduced HFMD attack rate by an average of 1.10 % (range: 0.38-1.51 %).PHSMs likely have a larger association with reduced HFMD transmissibility than school-based measures alone (i.e. school vacations). Preventive measures targeting preschoolers could be considered as potential options for reducing the future burden of HFMD.In this study, we used Korean national surveillance data on HFMD from 2014 to 2019 to estimate the temporal changes in HFMD transmissibility (instantaneous reproductive number, Rt). Furthermore, to assess the changes in the HFMD attack rate, we used a stochastic transmission model to simulate the HFMD epidemic with no school vacation and nationwide PHSMs in 2015 South Korea.","911":"Data System. The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) Study was funded by the Department of Health and Social Care in England to provide reliable and timely estimates of prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection over time, by person and place. Data Collection\/Processing. The study team (researchers from Imperial College London and its logistics partner Ipsos) wrote to named individuals aged 5 years and older in random cross-sections of the population of England, using the National Health Service list of patients registered with a general practitioner (near-universal coverage) as a sampling frame. We collected data over 2 to 3 weeks approximately every month across 19 rounds of data collection from May 1, 2020, to March 31, 2022. Data Analysis\/Dissemination. We have disseminated the data and study materials widely via the study Web site, preprints, publications in peer-reviewed journals, and the media. We make available data tabulations, suitably anonymized to protect participant confidentiality, on request to the study's data access committee. Public Health Implications. The study provided inter alia real-time data on SARS-CoV-2 prevalence over time, by area, and by sociodemographic variables; estimates of vaccine effectiveness; and symptom profiles, and detected emergence of new variants based on viral genome sequencing.

The overall test positivity rate was 2.4% (n = 615); 77.7% (n = 478) were asymptomatic. In Chicago, the only region with a sufficient sample size for analysis, the test positivity rate at L&D (peak of 5% on December 7, 2020) was lower and more stable than the test positivity rate of the general population (peak of 14% on November 13, 2020) and lagged hospital admissions for COVID-19-like illness (peak of 118 on November 15, 2020) and the test positivity rate of the general population by about 10 days (Pearson correlation = 0.73 and 0.75, respectively).Trends in the test positivity rate at L&D did not provide an earlier signal of increases in Illinois's SARS-CoV-2 prevalence than current state metrics did. Nonetheless, the role of universal testing protocols in identifying asymptomatic infection is important for clinical decision making and patient education about infection prevention and control.The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) assessed whether increases in the SARS-CoV-2 test positivity rate among pregnant people at labor and delivery (L&D) could signal increases in SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the general Illinois population earlier than current state metrics.Twenty-six birthing hospitals universally testing for SARS-CoV-2 at L&D voluntarily submitted data from June 21, 2020 through January 23, 2021, to IDPH. Hospitals reported the daily number of people who delivered, SARS-CoV-2 tests, and test results as well as symptom status. We compared the test positivity rate at L&D with the test positivity rate of the general population and the number of hospital admissions for COVID-19-like illness by quantifying correlations in trends and identifying a lead time.","913":"Despite great progress in eliminating trachoma from the majority of worldwide districts, trachoma control seems to have stalled in some endemic districts. Can mathematical models help suggest the way forward? We review specific achievements of models in trachoma control in the past. Models showed that, even with incomplete coverage, mass drug administration could eliminate disease through a spillover effect, somewhat analogous to how incomplete vaccine campaigns can eliminate disease through herd protection. Models also suggest that elimination can always be achieved if enough people are treated often enough with an effective enough drug. Other models supported the idea that targeting ages at highest risk or continued improvements in hygiene and sanitation can contribute meaningfully to trachoma control. Models of intensive targeting of a core group may point the way to final eradication even in areas with substantial transmission and within-community heterogeneity.","914":"Scrub typhus, a vector-borne bacterial infection, is an important but neglected disease globally. Accurately characterizing the burden is challenging because of nonspecific symptoms and limited diagnostics. Prior seroepidemiology studies have struggled to find consensus cutoffs that permit comparisons of estimates across contexts and time. In this study, we present a novel approach that does not require a cutoff and instead uses information about antibody kinetics after infection to estimate seroincidence. We use data from three cohorts of scrub typhus patients in Chiang Rai, Thailand, and Vellore, India, to characterize antibody kinetics after infection and two population serosurveys in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, and Tamil Nadu, India, to estimate seroincidence. The samples were tested for IgM and IgG responses to Orientia tsutsugamushi-derived recombinant 56-kDa antigen using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to characterize antibody responses after scrub typhus infection and used the joint distributions of the peak antibody titers and decay rates to estimate population-level incidence rates in the cross-sectional serosurveys. Median responses persisted above an optical density (OD) of 1.8 for 23.6 months for IgG and an OD of 1 for 4.5 months for IgM. Among 18- to 29-year-olds, the seroincidence was 10 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI, 5-19) in Tamil Nadu, India, and 14 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI: 10-20) in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. When seroincidence was calculated with antibody decay ignored, the disease burden was underestimated by more than 50%. The approach can be deployed prospectively, coupled with existing serosurveys, or leverage banked samples to efficiently generate scrub typhus seroincidence estimates.","915":"By adopting an optimal pathway from 2021 (namely, the year of the first Chinese Centennial Goals) onwards, cervical cancer could be eliminated by the late 2040s (namely, ahead of the second Chinese Centennial Goals) while saving net economic costs in China.The World Health Assembly has adopted a global strategy to eliminate cervical cancer. However, neither the optimal pathway nor the corresponding economic and health benefits have been evaluated. We take China as an example to assess the optimal pathway towards elimination and the cost-effectiveness of tailored actions.A validated hybrid model was used to assess the costs and benefits of alternative strategies combining human papillomavirus vaccination, cervical screening, and treatment of pre-invasive lesions and invasive cancer for females with different immunization history. All Chinese females living or projected to be born during 2015-2100, under projected trends in aging, urbanization, and sexual activity, were considered. Optimal strategies were determined by cost-effectiveness efficiency frontiers. Primary outcomes were cervical cancer cases and deaths averted and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We employed a lifetime horizon from a societal perspective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses evaluate model uncertainty.The optimal pathway represents an integration of multiple tailored strategies from females with different immunization history. If China adopts the optimal pathway, the age-standardized incidence of cervical cancer is predicted to decrease to fewer than four new cases per 100,000 women (i.e., elimination) by 2047 (95% confidence interval 2043 to 2050). Compared to the status quo, the optimal pathway would avert a total of 7,509,192 (6,922,744 to 8,359,074) cervical cancer cases and 2,529,873 (2,366,826 to 2,802,604) cervical cancer deaths in 2021-2100, with the discounted ICER being $-\u2009339 (-\u2009687 to -\u200979) per quality-adjusted life-year.","916":"The impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the socio-economic status of countries around the world should not be underestimated, when we consider the role it has played in various countries. Many people were unemployed, many households were careful about their spending, and a greater social divide in the population emerged in 14 different countries from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and from Africa (that is, in developed and developing countries) for which we have considered the epidemiological data on the spread of infection during the first and second waves, as well as their socio-economic data. We established a mathematical relationship between Theil and Gini indices, then we investigated the relationship between epidemiological data and socio-economic determinants, using several machine learning and deep learning methods. High correlations were observed between some of the socio-economic and epidemiological parameters and we predicted three of the socio-economic variables in order to validate our results. These results show a clear difference between the first and the second wave of the pandemic, confirming the impact of the real dynamics of the epidemic\u2019s spread in several countries and the means by which it was mitigated.","917":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections have spilled over from humans to companion and wild animals since the inception of the global COVID-19 pandemic. However, whole genome sequencing data of the viral genomes that infect non-human animal species have been scant. Here, we detected and sequenced a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (AY.3) in fecal samples from an 11-year-old domestic house cat previously exposed to an owner who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Molecular testing of two fecal samples collected 7 days apart yielded relatively high levels of viral RNA. Sequencing of the feline-derived viral genomes showed the two to be identical, and differing by between 4 and 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms in pairwise comparisons to human-derived lineage AY.3 sequences collected in the same geographic area and time period. However, several mutations unique to the feline samples reveal their divergence from this cohort on phylogenetic analysis. These results demonstrate continued spillover infections of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants that threaten human and animal health, as well as highlight the importance of collecting fecal samples when testing for SARS-CoV-2 in animals. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first published case of a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in a domestic cat in the United States.","918":"This study employs a qualitative exploratory study design with purposive sampling strategies, and it was conducted at 3 primary health care facilities in the province of Sindh, Pakistan. Seven focus group discussions with health care providers and 60 in-depth interviews with caregivers were conducted using semistructured interviews through virtual platforms (ConnectOnCall and Zoom). Transcripts were analyzed through thematic analysis.The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on different countries because of which various health and safety measures were implemented, with digital media playing a pivotal role. However, digital media also pose significant concerns such as misinformation and lack of direction.We aimed to explore the effects of COVID-19-related infodemics through digital, social, and electronic media on the vaccine-related attitudes of caregivers and health care providers in Pakistan.In a resource-constrained setting like Pakistan, the usage of mHealth, social media, and electronic media for information spread (both factual and mis\/disinformation) related to COVID-19 and its vaccination had a significant impact on attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination. Based on the qualitative findings, we generated a model of digital communications and information dissemination to increase knowledge about COVID-19 and its prevention measures, including vaccination, which can be replicated in similar settings for other disease burdens and related infodemics. Further, to mitigate the infodemics, both digital and nondigital interventions are needed at a larger scale.Our study reveals the pivotal role of electronic media, mobile health (mHealth), and social media during the COVID-19 pandemic. Four major themes were identified: (1) sources of information on COVID-19 and its vaccination, (2) electronic media value and misleading communication, (3) mHealth leveraging and limitations during COVID-19, and (4) social media influence and barriers during COVID-19. Health care providers and caregivers reported that the common sources of information were electronic media and mHealth, followed by social media. Some participants also used global media for more reliable information related to COVID-19. mHealth solutions such as public awareness messages, videos, call ringtones, and helplines promoted COVID-19 prevention techniques and vaccine registration. However, the overwhelming influx of news and sociobehavioral narratives, including misinformation\/disinformation through social media such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter, were found to be the primary enablers of vaccine-related infodemics. Electronic media and mHealth were utilized more widely to promote information and communication on the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination. However, social media and electronic media-driven infodemics were identified as the major factors for misinformation related to COVID-19 and vaccine hesitancy. Further, we found a digital divide between the urban and rural populations, with the use of electronic media in rural settings and social media in urban settings.","919":"We construct the investigative survey tool by adaptation of Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) and Capacity, Opportunity, and Motivation-Behavior (COM-B) models. We identify, compare and contrast factors that influence clinicians' antimicrobial prescription behavior. The factors are considered both intrinsically, such as personal attributes, and extrinsically, such as societal and professional norms.As the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) problem accelerates, humans and animals are suffering from the consequences of infections with diminishing antimicrobial treatment options. Within the One Medicine and One Health mandate, which denotes a collaborative, multisectoral, and transdisciplinary approach to improve medicine and health across human and animal sectors, we investigate how human and veterinary medical practitioners apply their medical and policy knowledge in prescribing antimicrobials. Different regions and locations establish different intermediary policies and programs to support clinicians in that pursuit. In Hong Kong, there are locally adapted programs at governance and clinical levels in the human medical field. However, there is no locally adapted veterinary antibiotic prescription guideline or stewardship program, and veterinarians adopt overseas or international professions' antimicrobial use guidelines. Such a policy environment creates a natural experiment to compare local policy implementation conditions and clinicians' knowledge, perception, and practice.The absence of locally adopted antimicrobial guidelines influences AMR stewardship program implementation in local Hong Kong veterinary community. As medical allies, physicians and veterinarians share similar demographic influence, organization considerations and perception of public awareness. Both cohorts prescribe more prudently with more years-in-practice, time available to communicate with patients or caretakers, and public awareness and support.","920":"Modelers apply system dynamics (SD) modeling in various fields for different purposes including policy analysis, however, they need to integrate SD with other methodologies to facilitate the inclusion of spatial factors and study their influence on the system\u0092s behavior. We investigate the combination of SD modeling with Geographic Information Systems using healthcare data to facilitate the study of both spatial and systemic factors for more effective policy design. We propose an algorithm for integrating these methodologies and explain one of its applications in the complex health systems\u0097Medicaid beneficiaries\u0092 access to primary care (PC). Our results reveal insights and information that were not available through merely SD modeling; this approach provides the opportunity for policymakers to learn about the influence of spatiotemporal factors on health outcomes in a complex health system, and identify the areas with a high need for PC providers.","921":"Feline Coronaviruses (FCoVs) commonly cause mild enteric infections in felines worldwide (termed Feline Enteric Coronavirus [FECV]), with around 12% developing into deadly Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP; Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus [FIPV]). Genomic differences between FECV and FIPV have been reported, yet the putative genotypic basis of the highly pathogenic phenotype remains unclear. Here, we used state-of-the-art molecular evolutionary genetic statistical techniques to identify and compare differences in natural selection pressure between FECV and FIPV sequences, as well as to identify FIPV and FECV specific signals of positive selection. We analyzed full length FCoV protein coding genes thought to contain mutations associated with FIPV (Spike, ORF3abc, and ORF7ab). We identified two sites exhibiting differences in natural selection pressure between FECV and FIPV: one within the S1\/S2 furin cleavage site, and the other within the fusion domain of Spike. We also found 15 sites subject to positive selection associated with FIPV within Spike, 11 of which have not previously been suggested as possibly relevant to FIP development. These sites fall within Spike protein subdomains that participate in host cell receptor interaction, immune evasion, tropism shifts, host cellular entry, and viral escape. There were 14 sites (12 novel) within Spike under positive selection associated with the FECV phenotype, almost exclusively within the S1\/S2 furin cleavage site and adjacent C domain, along with a signal of relaxed selection in FIPV relative to FECV, suggesting that furin cleavage functionality may not be needed for FIPV. Positive selection inferred in ORF7b was associated with the FECV phenotype, and included 24 positively selected sites, while ORF7b had signals of relaxed selection in FIPV. We found evidence of positive selection in ORF3c in FCoV wide analyses, but no specific association with the FIPV or FECV phenotype. We hypothesize that some combination of mutations in FECV may contribute to FIP development, and that is unlikely to be one singular \"switch\" mutational event. This work expands our understanding of the complexities of FIP development and provides insights into how evolutionary forces may alter pathogenesis in coronavirus genomes.","922":"Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, despite inclusion in the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). Serotype 3 increased in carriage since the implementation of PCV13 in the USA, while invasive disease rates remain unchanged. We investigated the persistence of serotype 3 in carriage and disease, through genomic analyses of a global sample of 301 serotype 3 isolates of the Netherlands3-31 (PMEN31) clone CC180, combined with associated patient data and PCV utilization among countries of isolate collection. We assessed phenotypic variation between dominant clades in capsule charge (zeta potential), capsular polysaccharide shedding, and susceptibility to opsonophagocytic killing, which have previously been associated with carriage duration, invasiveness, and vaccine escape. We identified a recent shift in the CC180 population attributed to a lineage termed Clade II, which was estimated by Bayesian coalescent analysis to have first appeared in 1968 [95% HPD: 1939-1989] and increased in prevalence and effective population size thereafter. Clade II isolates are divergent from the pre-PCV13 serotype 3 population in non-capsular antigenic composition, competence, and antibiotic susceptibility, the last of which resulting from the acquisition of a Tn916-like conjugative transposon. Differences in recombination rates among clades correlated with variations in the ATP-binding subunit of Clp protease, as well as amino acid substitutions in the comCDE operon. Opsonophagocytic killing assays elucidated the low observed efficacy of PCV13 against serotype 3. Variation in PCV13 use among sampled countries was not independently correlated with the CC180 population shift; therefore, genotypic and phenotypic differences in protein antigens and, in particular, antibiotic resistance may have contributed to the increase of Clade II. Our analysis emphasizes the need for routine, representative sampling of isolates from disperse geographic regions, including historically under-sampled areas. We also highlight the value of genomics in resolving antigenic and epidemiological variations within a serotype, which may have implications for future vaccine development.","923":"Clinical evidence alone was sufficient to make most clinical antituberculosis treatment decisions. The use of evidence-based algorithms may improve decentralized, rapid treatment-initiation, reducing the global burden of childhood mortality.We analyzed data from a prospective cohort of children <13 years being routinely evaluated for pulmonary tuberculosis in Cape Town, South Africa from March 2012 to November 2017. We developed a regression model to describe the contributions of baseline clinical evaluation to the diagnosis of tuberculosis using standardized, retrospective case definitions. We included results from baseline chest radiography and Xpert MTB\/RIF to the model to develop an algorithm with at least 90% sensitivity in predicting tuberculosis.Limitations in the sensitivity and accessibility of diagnostic tools for childhood tuberculosis contribute to the substantial gap between estimated cases and cases notified to national tuberculosis programs. Thus, tools to make accurate and rapid clinical diagnoses are necessary to initiate more children on antituberculosis treatment.Data from 478 children being evaluated for pulmonary tuberculosis were analyzed (median age: 16.2 months, interquartile range: 9.8-30.9); 242 (50.6%) were retrospectively classified with tuberculosis, of which 104 (43.0%) were bacteriologically-confirmed. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the final model was 0.87. Clinical evidence identified 71.4% of all tuberculosis cases in this cohort, and inclusion of baseline chest radiography results increased the proportion to 89.3%. The algorithm was 90.1% sensitive and 52.1% specific, and maintained a sensitivity of above 90% among children <2 years or with low weight-for-age.","924":"We conducted simulations assuming no effect of temperature on preterm birth. We generated pseudo-birth data from the observed seasonal patterns of birth in the United States and analyzed them in relation to observed temperatures using design-specific seasonality adjustments.Most designs can be implemented in a way that yields estimates unbiased by conception seasonality. The time-stratified case-crossover design exhibited a small positive bias, which could contribute to, but not fully explain, previously reported associations.Using the case-crossover approach (time-stratified by calendar month), we observed a bias (among 1,000 replicates) = 0.016 (Monte-Carlo standard error 95% CI: 0.015-0.018) in the regression coefficient for every 10\u00b0C increase in mean temperature in the warm season (May-September). Unbiased estimates obtained using the time-series approach required accounting for both the pregnancies-at-risk and their weighted probability of birth. Notably, adding the daily weighted probability of birth from the time-series models to the case-crossover models corrected the bias in the case-crossover approach. In the pair-matched case-control design, where the exposure period was matched on gestational window, we observed no bias. The time-to-event approach was also unbiased but was more computationally intensive than others.Seasonal patterns of conception may confound acute associations between birth outcomes and seasonally varying exposures. We aim to evaluate four epidemiologic designs (time-stratified case-crossover, time-series, pair-matched case-control, and time-to-event) commonly used to study acute associations between ambient temperature and preterm births.","925":"We propose a fractional order model for human papillomavirus (HPV) dynamics, including the effects of vaccination and public health education on developing cervical cancer. First, we discuss the general structure of Caputo fractional derivatives and integrals. Next, we define the fractional HPV model using Caputo derivatives. The model equilibrium quantities, with their stability, are discussed based on the magnitude of the reproduction number. We compute and simulate numerical solutions of the presented fractional model using the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton scheme. Meanwhile, real data sourced from reports from the World Health Organization is used to establish the parameters and compute the basic reproduction number. We present figures of state variables for different fractional orders and the classical integer order. The impacts of vaccination and public health education are discussed through numerical simulations. From the results, we observe that an increase in both vaccination rates and public health education increases the quality of life, and thus, reduces disease burden and suffering in communities. The results also confirm that modeling HPV transmission dynamics using fractional derivatives includes history effects in the model, making the model further insightful and appropriate for studying HPV dynamics.","926":"We seek to quantify magnitudes of underascertainment in COVID-19's cumulative incidence in Africa. Using serosurveillance and postmortem surveillance, we constructed multiplicative factors estimating ratios of true infections to reported cases in Africa since March 2020.The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on global health, the magnitude of which appears to differ intercontinentally: for example, reports suggest 271,900 per million people have been infected in Europe versus 8,800 per million people in Africa. While Africa is the second largest continent by population, its reported COVID-19 cases comprise <3% of global cases. Although social, environmental, and environmental explanations have been proposed to clarify this discrepancy, systematic infection underascertainment may be equally responsible.Multiplicative factors derived from serology data (subset of 12 nations) suggested a range of COVID-19 reporting rates, from 1 in 2 infections reported in Cape Verde (July 2020) to 1 in 3,795 infections reported in Malawi (June 2020). A similar set of multiplicative factors for all nations derived from postmortem data points toward the same conclusion: reported COVID-19 cases are unrepresentative of true infections, suggesting a key reason for low case burden in many African nations is significant underdetection and underreporting.While estimating COVID-19's exact burden is challenging, the multiplicative factors we present furnish incidence estimates reflecting likely-to-worst-case ranges of infection. Our results stress the need for expansive surveillance to allocate resources in areas experiencing discrepancies between reported cases, projected infections, and deaths.","927":"Enhanced electrical activity in detrusor smooth muscle (DSM) cells is a key factor in detrusor overactivity which causes overactive bladder pathological disorders. Transient receptor potential melastatin-4 (TRPM4) channels, which are calcium-activated cation channels, play a role in regulating DSM electrical activities. These channels likely contribute to depolarizing the DSM cell membrane, leading to bladder overactivity. Our research focuses on understanding TRPM4 channel function in the DSM cells of mice, using computational modeling. We aimed to create a detailed computational model of the TRPM4 channel based on existing electrophysiological data. We employed a modified Hodgkin-Huxley model with an incorporated TRP-like current to simulate action potential firing in response to current and synaptic stimulus inputs. Validation against experimental data showed close agreement with our simulations. Our model is the first to analyze the TRPM4 channel's role in DSM electrical activity, potentially revealing insights into bladder overactivity. In conclusion, TRPM4 channels are pivotal in regulating human DSM function, and TRPM4 channel inhibitors could be promising targets for treating overactive bladder.","928":"Gonorrhoea causes substantial health losses and costs in the United States. These results can inform planning and prioritization of prevention services.Discounted lifetime QALYs lost per incident gonococcal infection were estimated as 0.093 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 0.022-0.22) for women, 0.0020 (0.0015-0.0024) for heterosexual men, and 0.0015 (0.00070-0.0021) for MSM. Discounted lifetime costs per incident infection were USD 261 (109-480), 169 (88-263), and 133 (50-239), respectively. At the population level, total discounted lifetime QALYs lost due to infections acquired during 2015 were 53,293 (12,326-125,366) for women, 621 (430-872) for heterosexual men, and 1,078 (427-1,870) for MSM. Total discounted lifetime costs were USD 150 million (64-277 million), 54 million (25-92 million), and 97 million (34-197 million), respectively. The highest total burden of both QALYs and costs at the population-level was observed in Non-Hispanic Black women, and highest burden per 1,000 person-years was identified in MSM among men and American Indian\/Alaska Native among women.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Charles A. King Trust.We used probability-tree models to capture gonorrhoea sequelae and to estimate attributable disease burden in terms of the discounted lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost due to incident infections acquired during 2015 from the healthcare system perspective. Numbers of infections in 2015 were obtained from a published gonorrhoea transmission model. We evaluated population-level disease burden, disaggregated by sex, age, race\/ethnicity, and for men who have sex with men (MSM). We conducted a multivariate sensitivity analysis for key parameters.Disparities in the health and economic burden of gonorrhoea have not been systematically quantified. We estimated population-level health losses and costs associated with gonococcal infection and sequelae in the United States.","929":"Despite critical implications for disease dynamics and surveillance in wild long-lived species, the immune response after exposure to potentially highly pathogenic bacterial disease agents is still poorly known. Among infectious diseases threatening wild populations, avian cholera, caused by the bacterium Pasteurella multocida, is a major concern. It frequently causes massive mortality events in wild populations, notably affecting nestlings of Indian yellow-nosed albatrosses (Thalassarche carteri) in the Indian Ocean. If adults are able to mount a long-term immune response, this could have important consequences regarding the dynamics of the pathogen in the local host community and the potential interest of vaccinating breeding females to transfer immunity to their offspring. By tracking the dynamics of antibodies against P. multocida during 4\u00a0years and implementing a vaccination experiment in a population of yellow-nosed albatrosses, we show that a significant proportion of adults were naturally exposed despite high annual survival for both vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals. Adult-specific antibody levels were thus maintained long enough to inform about recent exposure. However, only low levels of maternal antibodies could be detected in nestlings the year following a vaccination of their mothers. A modification of the vaccine formulation and the possibility to re-vaccinate females 2\u00a0years after the first vaccination revealed that vaccines have the potential to elicit a stronger and more persistent response. Such results highlight the value of long-term observational and experimental studies of host exposure to infectious agents in the wild, where ecological and evolutionary processes are likely critical for driving disease dynamics.","930":"Dengue virus (DENV) often circulates endemically. In such settings with high levels of transmission, it remains unclear whether there are risk factors that alter individual infection risk. We tested blood taken from individuals living in multigenerational households in Kamphaeng Phet province, Thailand for DENV antibodies (N\u2009=\u20092364, mean age 31y). Seropositivity ranged from 45.4% among those 1-5y to 99.5% for those >30y. Using spatially explicit catalytic models, we estimated 11.8% of the susceptible population gets infected annually. We found 37.5% of the variance in seropositivity was explained by unmeasured household-level effects with only 4.2% explained by spatial differences between households. The serostatus of individuals from the same household remained significantly correlated even when separated by up to 15 years in age. These findings show that despite highly endemic transmission, persistent differences in infection risk exist across households, the reasons for which remain unclear.","931":"We find only weak evidence of an association between poverty and annual new case detection rates at the district level, though illiteracy and satellite radiance are statistically significant predictors of leprosy at the district level. We find no evidence of rapid decline over the period 2008-2015 in either new case detection or new Grade 2 disability.We used correlation and linear mixed effect regressions to assess whether poverty, illiteracy, nighttime satellite radiance (an index of development), and other covariates can explain district-wise annual new case detection rate and Grade 2 disability diagnoses.Our findings suggest a somewhat higher rate of leprosy detection, on average, in poorer districts; the overall effect is weak. The divide between leprosy case detection and true incidence of clinical leprosy complicates these results, particularly given that the detection rate is likely disproportionately lower in impoverished settings. Additional information is needed to distinguish the determinants of leprosy case detection and transmission during the elimination epoch.As leprosy elimination becomes an increasingly realistic goal, it is essential to determine the factors that contribute to its persistence. We evaluate social and economic factors as predictors of leprosy annual new case detection rates within India, where the majority of leprosy cases occur.","932":"The COVID-19 vaccine has been available in India since January 2021, although many individuals have refused to take the vaccine for various reasons. Vaccination plays a crucial role in disease control by preventing a substantial number of cases and associated disabilities. However, vaccine hesitancy poses a barrier that hinders these efforts. Our article presents a novel approach by proposing a mathematical model for COVID-19 that incorporates vaccine hesitancy, vaccine efficacy and behaviour compensation post-vaccination. The model is calibrated with COVID-19 incidence data for India from 13 February 2021 to 12 January 2022, using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The analysis examines the effects of hesitancy and social interventions through a series of practical simulations. The simulation results show that while COVID-19-infected individuals may have natural immunity, vaccination post-recovery is crucial to reduce cases by up to 64.1%. Social interventions, such as face masks and distancing, remain essential to prevent a rise in cases and ensure effective disease control. The model demonstrates that vaccination, combined with continued social interventions, is crucial for effectively reducing COVID-19 cases and preventing future outbreaks. Addressing vaccine hesitancy and maintaining preventive measures are key to successfully controlling the pandemic.","933":"We estimate the number of COVID-19 cases from newly reported deaths in a population without previous reports. Our results suggest that by the time a single death occurs, hundreds to thousands of cases are likely to be present in that population. This suggests containment via contact tracing will be challenging at this point, and other response strategies should be considered. Our approach is implemented in a publicly available, user-friendly, online tool.","934":"Few studies have focused on the immune response to more recent influenza vaccine formulations such as cell-cultured inactivated influenza vaccine (ccIIV4) or live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) in older children and young adults, or differences in immunoglobulin response using newer antibody landscape technology.Age and prior season vaccination may play a role in the immune response in children and young adults to ccIIV4 and LAIV4. While immunoglobulin isotypes provide high-level antigen-specific information, HAI titers alone can provide a meaningful representation of day 28 post-vaccination response.Participants ages 4-21 were randomized to receive ccIIV4 (n = 112) or LAIV4 (n = 118). A novel high-throughput multiplex influenza antibody detection assay was used to provide detailed IgG, IgA, and IgM antibody isotypes, along with hemagglutination inhibition levels (HAI), measured pre- and 28 days post-vaccination.The HAI and immunoglobulin isotype response to ccIIV4 was greater than LAIV4, with significant increases in IgG but not IgA or IgM. The youngest participants had the highest LAIV4 response. Prior LAIV4 vaccination was associated with a higher response to current season ccIIV4. Cross-reactive A\/Delaware\/55\/2019(H1N1)pdm09 antibodies were present pre-vaccination and increased in response to ccIIV4, but not LAIV4. Immunoglobulin assays strongly correlated with and confirmed the findings of HAI titers to measure immune response.NCT03982069.","935":"Ebola virus disease poses a recurring risk to human health. We conducted a systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42023393345) of Ebola virus disease transmission models and parameters published from database inception to July 7, 2023, from PubMed and Web of Science. Two people screened each abstract and full text. Papers were extracted with a bespoke Access database, 10% were double extracted. We extracted 1280 parameters and 295 models from 522 papers. Basic reproduction number estimates were highly variable, as were effective reproduction numbers, likely reflecting spatiotemporal variability in interventions. Random-effect estimates were 15\u00b74 days (95% CI 13\u00b72-17\u00b75) for the serial interval, 8\u00b75 days (7\u00b77-9\u00b72) for the incubation period, 9\u00b73 days (8\u00b75-10\u00b71) for the symptom-onset-to-death delay, and 13\u00b70 days (10\u00b74-15\u00b77) for symptom-onset-to-recovery. Common effect estimates were similar, albeit with narrower CIs. Case-fatality ratio estimates were generally high but highly variable, which could reflect heterogeneity in underlying risk factors. Although a substantial body of literature exists on Ebola virus disease models and epidemiological parameter estimates, many of these studies focus on the west African Ebola epidemic and are primarily associated with Zaire Ebola virus, which leaves a key gap in our knowledge regarding other Ebola virus species and outbreak contexts.","936":"Approximately 80% of adults are infected with a member of the herpesviridae family. Herpesviruses establish life-long latent infections within neurons, which may reactivate into lytic infections due to stress or immune suppression. There are nine human herpesviruses (HHV) posing health concerns from benign conditions to life threatening encephalitis, including cancers associated with viral infections. The current treatment options for most HHV conditions mainly include several nucleoside and nucleotide analogs targeting viral DNA polymerase. Although these drugs help manage infections, their common mechanism of action may lead to the development of drug resistance, which is particularly devastating in immunocompromised patients. Therefore, new classes of drugs directed against novel targets in HHVs are necessary to alleviate this issue. We analyzed the conservation rates of all proteins in herpes simplex virus 1 (HHV-1), a representative of the HHV family and one of the most common viruses infecting the human population. Furthermore, we generated a full-length structure model of the most conserved HHV-1 protein, the DNA packaging terminase pUL15. A series of computational analyses were performed on the model to identify ATP and DNA binding sites and characterize the dynamics of the protein. Our study indicates that proteins involved in HHV-1 DNA packaging and cleavage are amongst the most conserved gene products of HHVs. Since the packaging protein pUL15 is the most conserved among all HHV-1 gene products, the virus will have a lower chance of developing resistance to small molecules targeting pUL15. A subsequent analysis of the structure of pUL15 revealed distinct ATP and DNA binding domains and the elastic network model identifies a functionally important hinge region between the two domains of pUL15. The atomic information on the active and allosteric sites in the ATP- and DNA-bound model of pUL15 presented in this study can inform the structure-based drug discovery of a new class of drugs to treat a wide range of HHVs.","937":"The dilution effect predicts increasing biodiversity to reduce the risk of infection, but the generality of this effect remains unresolved. Because biodiversity loss generates predictable changes in host community competence, we hypothesised that biodiversity loss might drive the dilution effect. We tested this hypothesis by reanalysing four previously published meta-analyses that came to contradictory conclusions regarding generality of the dilution effect. In the context of biodiversity loss, our analyses revealed a unifying pattern: dilution effects were inconsistently observed for natural biodiversity gradients, but were commonly observed for biodiversity gradients generated by disturbances causing losses of biodiversity. Incorporating biodiversity loss into tests of generality of the dilution effect further indicated that scale-dependency may strengthen the dilution effect only when biodiversity gradients are driven by biodiversity loss. Together, these results help to resolve one of the most contentious issues in disease ecology: the generality of the dilution effect.","938":"The paper outlines a general approach to deriving quasi-steady-state approximations (QSSAs) of the stochastic reaction networks describing the Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics. In particular, it explains how different sets of assumptions about chemical species abundance and reaction rates lead to the standard QSSA, the total QSSA, and the reverse QSSA. These three QSSAs have been widely studied in the literature in deterministic ordinary differential equation settings, and several sets of conditions for their validity have been proposed. With the help of the multiscaling techniques introduced in Ball et al. (Ann Appl Probab 16(4):1925-1961, 2006), Kang and Kurtz (Ann Appl Probab 23(2):529-583, 2013), it is seen that the conditions for deterministic QSSAs largely agree (with some exceptions) with the ones for stochastic QSSAs in the large-volume limits. The paper also illustrates how the stochastic QSSA approach may be extended to more complex stochastic kinetic networks like, for instance, the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor system.","939":"The most commonly seen OCE was incus erosion, followed by stapes and malleus erosions. The results of this study show that there are more OCE in the COM-C group than in the COM-G and COM groups. To our knowledge, this study has the widest patient population in the literature focused on the OCE relation with COM, COM-C, and COM-G and its effect on the preoperative hearing level.The aim of this study was to evaluate the ossicular chain erosions (OCE) in chronic otitis media patients with cholesteatoma (COM-C) or without cholesteatoma (COM).The OCE and preoperative hearing levels of a total of 915 patients were evaluated retrospectively. Patients were divided into three groups. Of the 915 patients, 615 (67.2%) had COM, 234 (25.6%) had COM-C, and 66 (7.2%) had chronic otitis media with granulation tissue (COM-G).OCE was found in 291 (31.8%) of 915 patients. OCE was found in 192 (82%) of 234 patients with COM-C, 21 (31.8%) of 66 patients with COM-G, and 78 (12.7%) of 615 patients with COM.","940":"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a member of the \u03b2 -herpesvirus subfamily within Herpesviridae that is nearly ubiquitous in human populations, and infection generally results only in mild symptoms. However, symptoms can be severe in immunonaive individuals, and transplacental congenital infection of HCMV can result in serious neurological sequelae. Recent work has revealed much about the demographic and selective forces shaping the evolution of congenitally transmitted HCMV both on the level of hosts and within host compartments, providing insight into the dynamics of congenital infection, reinfection, and evolution of HCMV with important implications for the development of effective treatments and vaccines.","941":"The outcome of pathogen spillover from a reservoir to a novel host population can range from a \"dead-end\" when there is no onward transmission in the recipient population, to epidemic spread and even establishment in new hosts. Understanding the evolutionary epidemiology of spillover events leading to discrete outcomes in novel hosts is key to predicting risk and can lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of emergence. Here we use a Bayesian phylodynamic approach to examine cross-species transmission and evolutionary dynamics during a canine distemper virus (CDV) spillover event causing clinical disease and population decline in an African lion population (Panthera leo) in the Serengeti Ecological Region between 1993 and 1994. Using 21 near-complete viral genomes from four species we found that this large-scale outbreak was likely\u00a0 ignited by a single cross-species spillover event from a canid reservoir to noncanid hosts <1\u00a0year before disease detection and explosive spread of CDV in lions. Cross-species transmission from other noncanid species probably fuelled the high prevalence of CDV across spatially structured lion prides. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) could have acted as the proximate source of CDV exposure in lions. We report 13 nucleotide substitutions segregating CDV strains found in canids and noncanids. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that virus evolution played a role in CDV emergence in noncanid hosts following spillover during the outbreak, suggest that host barriers to clinical infection can limit outcomes of CDV spillover in novel host species.","942":"Viral infections of microbial cells often culminate in lysis and the release of new virus particles. However, viruses of microbes can also initiate chronic infections, in which new viruses particles are released via budding and without cell lysis. In chronic infections, viral genomes may also be passed on from mother to daughter cells during division. The consequences of chronic infections for the population dynamics of viruses and microbes remains under-explored. In this paper we present a model of chronic infections as well as a model of interactions between lytic and chronic viruses competing for the same microbial population. In the chronic only model, we identify conditions underlying complex bifurcations such as saddle-node, backward and Hopfbifurcations, leading to parameter regions with multiple attractors and\/or oscillatory behavior. We then utilize invasion analysis to examine the coupled nonlinear system of microbes, lytic viruses, and chronic viruses. In so doing we find unexpected results, including a regime in which the chronic virus requires the lytic virus for survival, invasion, and persistence. In this regime, lytic viruses decrease total cell densities, so that a subpopulation of chronically infected cells experience decreased niche competition. As such, even when chronically infected cells have a growth disadvantage, lytic viruses can, paradoxically, enable the proliferation of both chronically infected cells and chronic viruses. We discuss the implications of our results for understanding the ecology and long-term evolution of heterogeneous viral strategies.","943":"Mathematical models are a valuable tool for studying and predicting the spread of infectious agents. The accuracy of model simulations and predictions invariably depends on the specification of model parameters. Estimation of these parameters is therefore extremely important; however, while some parameters can be derived from observational studies, the values of others are difficult to measure. Instead, models can be coupled with inference algorithms (i.e., data assimilation methods, or statistical filters), which fit model simulations to existing observations and estimate unobserved model state variables and parameters. Ideally, these inference algorithms should find the best fitting solution for a given model and set of observations; however, as those estimated quantities are unobserved, it is typically uncertain whether the correct parameters have been identified. Further, it is unclear what 'correct' really means for abstract parameters defined based on specific model forms. In this work, we explored the problem of non-identifiability in a stochastic system which, when overlooked, can significantly impede model prediction. We used a network, agent-based model to simulate the transmission of Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) within hospital settings and attempted to infer key model parameters using the Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter, an efficient Bayesian inference algorithm. We show that even though the inference method converged and that simulations using the estimated parameters produced an agreement with observations, the true parameters are not fully identifiable. While the model-inference system can exclude a substantial area of parameter space that is unlikely to contain the true parameters, the estimated parameter range still included multiple parameter combinations that can fit observations equally well. We show that analyzing synthetic trajectories can support or contradict claims of identifiability. While we perform this on a specific model system, this approach can be generalized for a variety of stochastic representations of partially observable systems. We also suggest data manipulations intended to improve identifiability that might be applicable in many systems of interest.","944":"The current state of much of the Wuhan pneumonia virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) research shows a regrettable lack of data sharing and considerable analytical obfuscation. This impedes global research cooperation, which is essential for tackling public health emergencies and requires unimpeded access to data, analysis tools, and computational infrastructure. Here, we show that community efforts in developing open analytical software tools over the past 10 years, combined with national investments into scientific computational infrastructure, can overcome these deficiencies and provide an accessible platform for tackling global health emergencies in an open and transparent manner. Specifically, we use all SARS-CoV-2 genomic data available in the public domain so far to (1) underscore the importance of access to raw data and (2) demonstrate that existing community efforts in curation and deployment of biomedical software can reliably support rapid, reproducible research during global health crises.

It confirmed some of the previously reported environmental factors associated with COVID-19 mortality, but also generated unexpected predictors that may warrant more focused evaluation.","946":"Aim The aim of the study was to examine longitudinal growth in intelligibility in connected speech from 2 to 8 years of age in children with cerebral palsy. Method Sixty-five children with cerebral palsy participated in the longitudinal study. Children were classified into speech-language profile groups using age-4 data: no speech motor impairment (SMI), SMI with typical language comprehension, and SMI with impaired language comprehension. We fit a Bayesian nonlinear mixed-effects model of intelligibility growth at the child and group levels. We compared groups by age of steepest growth, maximum growth rate, and predicted intelligibility at 8 years of age. Results The no SMI group showed earlier and steeper intelligibility growth and higher average outcomes compared to the SMI groups. The SMI groups had more variable growth trajectories, but the SMI with typical language comprehension group had higher age-8 outcomes and steeper rates of maximum growth than the SMI with impaired language comprehension group. Language comprehension impairment at age of 4 years predicted lower intelligibility outcomes at age of 8 years, compared to typical language at age of 4 years. Interpretation Children with SMI at age of 4 years show highly variable intelligibility growth trajectories, and comorbid language comprehension impairment predicts lower intelligibility outcomes.

Some aspects of adult mosquito behavior and mosquito ecology play an important role in determining the capacity of vector populations to transmit pathogens. Here, we re-examine factors affecting the transmission of pathogens by mosquitoes using a new approach. Unlike most previous models, this framework considers the behavioral states and state transitions of adult mosquitoes through a sequence of activity bouts. We developed a new framework for individual-based simulation models called MBITES (Mosquito Bout-based and Individual-based Transmission Ecology Simulator). In MBITES, it is possible to build models that simulate the behavior and ecology of adult mosquitoes in exquisite detail on complex resource landscapes generated by spatial point processes. We also developed an ordinary differential equation model which is the Kolmogorov forward equations for models developed in MBITES under a specific set of simplifying assumptions. While mosquito infection and pathogen development are one possible part of a mosquito's state, that is not our main focus. Using extensive simulation using some models developed in MBITES, we show that vectorial capacity can be understood as an emergent property of simple behavioral algorithms interacting with complex resource landscapes, and that relative density or sparsity of resources and the need to search can have profound consequences for mosquito populations' capacity to transmit pathogens.","948":"The software tool is integrated into the eLSA software package that now provides accelerated local trend and similarity analysis pipelines for time series data. The package is freely available from the eLSA website: http:\/\/bitbucket.org\/charade\/elsa.By extending the theories for the tail probability of the range of sum of Markovian random variables, we propose formulae for approximating the statistical significance of local trend scores. Using simulations and real data, we show that the approximate p-value is close to that obtained using a large number of permutations (starting at time points >20 with no delay and >30 with delay of at most three time steps) in that the non-zero decimals of the p-values obtained by the approximation and the permutations are mostly the same when the approximate p-value is less than 0.05. In addition, the approximate p-value is slightly larger than that based on permutations making hypothesis testing based on the approximate p-value conservative. The approximation enables efficient calculation of p-values for pairwise local trend analysis, making large scale all-versus-all comparisons possible. We also propose a hybrid approach by integrating the approximation and permutations to obtain accurate p-values for significantly associated pairs. We further demonstrate its use with the analysis of the Polymouth Marine Laboratory (PML) microbial community time series from high-throughput sequencing data and found interesting organism co-occurrence dynamic patterns.Local trend (i.e. shape) analysis of time series data reveals co-changing patterns in dynamics of biological systems. However, slow permutation procedures to evaluate the statistical significance of local trend scores have limited its applications to high-throughput time series data analysis, e.g., data from the next generation sequencing technology based studies.","949":"Although physicians learn about new medical technologies from their peers, the magnitude and source of peer influence is unknown. We estimate the effect of peer adoption of three first-in-class medications (dabigatran, sitigliptin, and aliskiren) on physicians' own adoption of those medications. We included 11,958 physicians in Pennsylvania prescribing anticoagulant, antidiabetic, and antihypertensive medications. We constructed 4 types of peer networks based on shared Medicare and Medicaid patients, medical group affiliation, hospital affiliation, and medical school\/residency training. Instrumental variables analysis was used to estimate the causal effect of peer adoption (fraction of peers in each network adopting the new drug) on physician adoption (prescribing at least the median number prescriptions within 15 months of the new drug's introduction). We illustrate how physician network position can inform targeting of interventions to physicians by computing a social multiplier. Dabigatran was adopted by 25.2%, sitagliptin by 24.5% and aliskiren by 8.3% of physicians. A 10-percentage point increase in peer adoption in the patient-sharing network led to a 5.90% (SE = 1.50%, p<0.001) increase in physician adoption of dabigatran, 8.32% (SE = 1.51%, p<0.001) increase in sitagliptin, and 7.84% increase in aliskiren adoption (SE = 2.93%, p<0.001). Peer effects through shared hospital affiliation were positive but not significant, and medical group and training network effects were not reliably estimated. Physicians in the top decile of patient-sharing network peers were estimated to have nearly 2-fold stronger influence on their peers' adoption compared to physicians in the top decile of prescribing volume. Limitations include lack of detailed clinical information and pharmaceutical promotion, variables which may influence physician adoption but which are unlikely to bias our peer effect estimates. Peer adoption, especially by those with whom physicians share patients, strongly influenced physician adoption of new drugs. Our study shows the potential for using information on physician peer networks to improve technology diffusion.","950":"Using recently observed low LAIV effectiveness values, fewer influenza cases will occur if LAIV is not used compared with having LAIV as a vaccine option. However, having the option to use LAIV may be favored if LAIV effectiveness returns to prior levels or if the absence of vaccine choice substantially decreases overall vaccine uptake.Decreased live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) effectiveness in the U.S. prompted the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in August 2016 to recommend against this vaccine's use. However, overall influenza uptake increases when LAIV is available and, unlike the U.S., LAIV has retained its effectiveness in other countries. These opposing countercurrents create a dilemma.To examine the potential consequences of the decision to not recommend LAIV, which may result in decreased influenza vaccination coverage in the U.S. population, a Markov decision analysis model was used to examine influenza vaccination options in U.S. children aged 2-8 years. Data were compiled and analyzed in 2016.Continued surveillance of LAIV effectiveness and influenza vaccine uptake is warranted, given their importance in influenza vaccination policy decisions.","951":" scores of 92.1 (substances) and 81.7 (effects) on hold-out data. We identified 458 unique substances and 235 unique effects. Of the 130 potential remedies strongly associated with withdrawal symptoms, 54 (41.5%) were Food and Drug Administration-approved or commonly used treatments for the symptom, 17 (13.1%) were not often used to treat the symptom but could be potentially useful given their pharmacological profile, 13 (10%) were natural or home remedies, 7 (5.4%) were causes of the symptom, and 39 (30%) were other or unclear. We identified both potentially promising remedies (eg, gabapentin for body aches) and potentially common but harmful remedies (eg, antihistamines for restless leg syndrome).Many of the withdrawal remedies discussed by Reddit users are either clinically proven or potentially useful. These results suggest that this methodology is a valid way to study the self-treatment behavior of a web-based community of people who use opioids. Our Withdrawal Remedy Explorer application provides a platform for using these data for pharmacovigilance, the identification of new treatments, and the better understanding of the needs of people undergoing opioid withdrawal. Furthermore, this approach could be applied to many other disease states for which people self-manage their symptoms and discuss their experiences on the web.The cessation of opioid use can cause withdrawal symptoms. People often continue opioid misuse to avoid these symptoms. Many people who use opioids self-treat withdrawal symptoms with a range of substances. Little is known about the substances that people use or their effects.The aim of this study is to validate a methodology for identifying the substances used to treat symptoms of opioid withdrawal by a community of people who use opioids on the social media site Reddit.We developed a named entity recognition model to extract substances and effects from nearly 4 million comments from the r\/opiates and r\/OpiatesRecovery subreddits. To identify effects that are symptoms of opioid withdrawal and substances that are potential remedies for these symptoms, we deduplicated substances and effects by using clustering and manual review, then built a network of substance and effect co-occurrence. For each of the 16 effects identified as symptoms of opioid withdrawal in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, we identified the 10 most strongly associated substances. We classified these pairs as follows: substance is a Food and Drug Administration-approved or commonly used treatment for the symptom, substance is not often used to treat the symptom but could be potentially useful given its pharmacological profile, substance is a home or natural remedy for the symptom, substance can cause the symptom, or other or unclear. We developed the Withdrawal Remedy Explorer application to facilitate the further exploration of the data.","952":"Since the original Ross-Macdonald formulations of vector-borne disease transmission, there has been a broad proliferation of mathematical models of vector-borne disease, but many of these models retain most to all of the simplifying assumptions of the original formulations. Recently, there has been a new expansion of mathematical frameworks that contain explicit representations of the vector life cycle including aquatic stages, multiple vector species, host heterogeneity in biting rate, realistic vector feeding behavior, and spatial heterogeneity. In particular, there are now multiple frameworks for spatially explicit dynamics with movements of vector, host, or both. These frameworks are flexible and powerful, but require additional data to take advantage of these features. For a given question posed, utilizing a range of models with varying complexity and assumptions can provide a deeper understanding of the answers derived from models.","953":"Air transportation plays an essential role in the global economy. Therefore, there is a great deal of work to understand better the complex network formed by the links between the origins and destinations of flights. Some investigations show that the world air transportation network exhibits a community and a core-periphery structure. Although precious, these representations do not distinguish the inter-regional (global) web of connections from the regional (local) one. Therefore, we propose a new mesoscopic model called the component structure that decomposes the network into local and global components. Local components are the dense areas of the network, and global components are the nodes and links bridging the local components. As a case study, we consider the unweighted and undirected world air transportation network. Experiments show that it contains seven large local components and multiple small ones spatially well-defined. Moreover, it has a main global component covering the world. We perform an extensive comparative analysis of the structure of the components. Results demonstrate the non-homogeneous nature of the world air transportation network. The local components structure highlights regional differences, and the global component organization captures the efficiency of inter-regional travel. Centrality analysis of the components allows distinguishing airports centered on regional destinations from those focused on inter-regional exchanges. Core analysis is more accurate in the components than in the whole network where Europe dominates, blurring the rest of the world. Besides the world air transportation network, this paper demonstrates the potential of the component decomposition for modeling and analyzing the mesoscale structure of networks.","954":"Point-of-care testing (POCT) assays for chlamydia are being developed. Their potential impact on the burden of chlamydial infection in the United States, in light of suboptimal screening coverage, remains unclear.Using a transmission model calibrated to data in the United States, we estimated the impact of POCT on chlamydia prevalence, incidence, and chlamydia-attributable pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) incidence, assuming status quo (Analysis 1) and improved (Analysis 2) screening frequencies. We tested the robustness of results to changes in POCT sensitivity, the proportion of patients getting treated immediately, the baseline proportion lost to follow-up (LTFU), and the average treatment delay.POCT could improve chlamydia prevention efforts if test performance characteristics are significantly improved over currently available options.In Analysis 1, high POCT sensitivity was needed to reduce the chlamydia-associated burden. With a POCT sensitivity of 90%, reductions from the baseline burden only occurred in scenarios in which over 60% of the screened individuals would get immediate treatment and the baseline LTFU proportion was 20%. With a POCT sensitivity of 99% (baseline LTFU 10%, 2-week treatment delay), if everyone were treated immediately, the prevalence reduction was estimated at 5.7% (95% credible interval [CrI] 3.9-8.2%). If only 30% of tested persons would wait for results, the prevalence reduction was only 1.6% (95% CrI 1.1-2.3). POCT with 99% sensitivity could avert up to 12 700 (95% CrI 5000-22 200) PID cases per year, if 100% were treated immediately (baseline LTFU 20% and 3-week treatment delay). In Analysis 2, when POCT was coupled with increasing screening coverage, reductions in the chlamydia burden could be realized with a POCT sensitivity of 90%.","955":"\u0097Objective: This work investigates the possibility of automated malaria parasite detection in thick blood smears with smartphones. Methods: We have developed the first deep learning method that can detect malaria parasites in thick blood smear images and can run on smartphones. Our method consists of two processing steps. First, we apply an intensity-based Iterative Global Minimum Screening (IGMS), which performs a fast screening of a thick smear image to find parasite candidates. Then, a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifies each candidate as either parasite or background. Together with this paper, we make a dataset of 1819 thick smear images from 150 patients publicly available to the research community. We used this dataset to train and test our deep learning method, as described in this paper. Results: A patient-level five-fold cross-evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the customized CNN model in discriminating between positive (parasitic) and negative image patches in terms of the following performance indicators: accuracy (93.46% \u00b1 0.32%), AUC (98.39% \u00b1 0.18%), sensitivity (92.59% \u00b1 1.27%), specificity (94.33% \u00b1 1.25%), precision (94.25% \u00b1 1.13%), and negative predictive value (92.74% \u00b1 1.09%). High correlation coefficients (>0.98) between automatically detected parasites and ground truth, on both image level and patient level, demonstrate the practicality of our method. Conclusion: Promising results are obtained for parasite detection in thick blood smears a smartphone application using deep learning methods. Significance: Automated parasite detection running on smartphones is a promising alternative to manual parasite counting for malaria diagnosis, especially in areas lacking experienced parasitologists.","956":"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) are highly prevalent viruses estimated to infect approximately 300 million people and 12-72 million people worldwide, respectively. HDV requires the HBV envelope to establish a successful infection. Concurrent infection with HBV and HDV can result in more severe disease outcomes than infection with HBV alone. These viruses can cause significant hepatic disease, including cirrhosis, fulminant hepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, and represent a significant cause of global mortality. Therefore, a thorough understanding of these viruses and the immune response they generate is essential to enhance disease management. This review includes an overview of the HBV and HDV viruses, including life cycle, structure, natural course of infection, and histopathology. A discussion of the interplay between HDV RNA and HBV DNA during chronic infection is also included. It then discusses characteristics of the immune response with a focus on reactions to the antigenic hepatitis B surface antigen, including small, middle, and large surface antigens. This paper also reviews characteristics of the immune response to the hepatitis D antigen (including small and large antigens), the only protein expressed by hepatitis D. Lastly, we conclude with a discussion of recent therapeutic advances pertaining to these viruses.","957":"The region of St. Louis, Missouri, has displayed a high level of heterogeneity in COVID-19 cases, hospitalization, and vaccination coverage. We investigate how human mobility, vaccination, and time-varying transmission rates influenced SARS-CoV-2 transmission in five counties in the St. Louis area. A COVID-19 model with a system of ordinary differential equations was developed to illustrate the dynamics with a fully vaccinated class. Using the weekly number of vaccinations, cases, and hospitalization data from five counties in the greater St. Louis area in 2021, parameter estimation for the model was completed. The transmission coefficients for each county changed four times in that year to fit the model and the changing behaviour. We predicted the changes in disease spread under scenarios with increased vaccination coverage. SafeGraph local movement data were used to connect the forces of infection across various counties.","958":"Modified-weight HEI scores were associated with 23% to 38% reduced all-cause mortality risk in the highest vs. lowest quintile, while comparisons were only significant for women (Key Facets p=0.02 and LR-weighted p=0.001; for men p=0.06 on both scores), trends across quintiles of modified-weight scores were significant for men and women. The HEI-2015 was not significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk, and none of the scores were associated with CVD mortality risk.Only modified-weight HEI scores were associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk. Findings suggest modified diet quality weighting schemes warrant further examination to determine their replicability.Three energy-adjusted HEI scores were assigned to quintiles; covariate-adjusted sex-stratified Cox models with age as the timescale assessed associations between and trends across quintiles of HEI scores and all-cause and CVD mortality risk.This was a longitudinal analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (1988-94) with 23 years of mortality follow-up. The HEI-2015 and modified-weight scores were calculated from one 24-hour recall. The a priori Key Facets HEI was a subset score equivalently weighting fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and seafood and plant proteins. In the LASSO regression (LR)-weighted HEI, components were assigned weights reflecting relative mortality risk associations.All-cause and CVD mortality risk were the primary outcomes examined.\/setting: Analyses included 10,789 U.S. adults (\u2265 20 years) who were not pregnant and without prior diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), or chronic kidney disease diagnoses.This study examined whether Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015) scores with modified (vs. standard) component weights are differentially associated with mortality risk.Various diet quality scores are consistently and similarly associated with mortality risk. Emerging evidence suggests that individual diet quality components are differentially associated with mortality risk, but it is unclear whether modified weights reflective of relative component differences would strengthen mortality associations.","959":"The many variations on a graphic illustrating the impact of non-pharmaceutical measures to mitigate pandemic influenza that have appeared in recent news reports about COVID-19 suggest a need to better explain the mechanism by which social distancing reduces the spread of infectious diseases. And some reports understate one benefit of reducing the frequency or proximity of interpersonal encounters, a reduction in the total number of infections. In hopes that understanding will increase compliance, we describe how social distancing (a) reduces the peak incidence of infections, (b) delays the occurrence of this peak, and (c) reduces the total number of infections during epidemics. In view of the extraordinary efforts underway to identify existing medications that are active against SARS-CoV-2 and to develop new antiviral drugs, vaccines and antibody therapies, any of which may have community-level effects, we also describe how pharmaceutical interventions affect transmission.","960":"We studied 3,163 pregnant women aged 18-35\u00a0years with 9-20\u00a0weeks of gestation, recruited as part of the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) randomized controlled trial in Guatemala, India, Peru, and Rwanda. We assessed 24-hour personal exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), and carbon monoxide (CO), and measured hemoglobin levels at baseline (15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0weeks gestation). Linear and logistic regression models were used to examine the associations of measured pollutants with hemoglobin levels and anemia prevalence, adjusting for confounding.We evaluated the associations between personal exposure to air pollution and both hemoglobin levels and anemia prevalence among pregnant women in a multi-country randomized controlled trial.Our findings suggest that exposure to CO is associated with higher hemoglobin and lower anemia prevalence among pregnant women, whereas PM2.5 showed the opposite associations.Single-pollutant models showed associations of CO with higher hemoglobin levels and lower anemia prevalence. Bipollutant models involving CO and PM2.5 also revealed that an interquartile range (IQR) increase in CO concentrations (2.26\u00a0ppm) was associated with higher hemoglobin levels [\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.04; 95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI): 0.01, 0.07], and a lower odds of anemia prevalence [odds ratios (OR)\u00a0=\u00a00.90; 95\u00a0% CI: 0.83, 0.98]. PM2.5 was inversely related to hemoglobin and positively associated with anemia, but results were not statistically significant at the 0.05 alpha level. County-specific results showed that 3 of 4 countries showed a similar association between CO and hemoglobin. We found no association of BC levels with hemoglobin levels or with anemia prevalence.Anemia is common in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), causing significant health issues and social burdens. Exposure to household air pollution from using biomass fuels for cooking and heating has been associated with anemia, but the exposure-response association has not been studied.","961":" (recovered class). Dynamics and numerical approximations for the proposed fractional-order model are studied. Firstly, positivity and boundedness of the model are established. Secondly, the basic reproduction number of the model is calculated by using the next generation matrix approach. Then, asymptotic stability of the model is investigated. Lastly, we apply the adaptive predictor-corrector algorithm and fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method to simulate the proposed model. Consequently, a set of numerical simulations are performed to support the validity of the theoretical results. The numerical simulations indicate that there is a good agreement between theoretical results and numerical ones.","962":"The within-host evolutionary dynamics of tuberculosis (TB) remain unclear, and underlying biological characteristics render standard population genetic approaches based upon the Wright-Fisher model largely inappropriate. In addition, the compact genome combined with an absence of recombination is expected to result in strong purifying selection effects. Thus, it is imperative to establish a biologically relevant evolutionary framework incorporating these factors in order to enable an accurate study of this important human pathogen. Further, such a model is critical for inferring fundamental evolutionary parameters related to patient treatment, including mutation rates and the severity of infection bottlenecks. We here implement such a model and infer the underlying evolutionary parameters governing within-patient evolutionary dynamics. Results demonstrate that the progeny skew associated with the clonal nature of TB severely reduces genetic diversity and that the neglect of this parameter in previous studies has led to significant mis-inference of mutation rates. As such, our results suggest an underlying de novo mutation rate that is considerably faster than previously inferred, and a progeny distribution differing significantly from Wright-Fisher assumptions. This inference represents a more appropriate evolutionary null model, against which the periodic effects of positive selection, associated with drug-resistance for example, may be better assessed.","963":"Complex ecological relationships, such as host-parasite interactions, are often modeled with laboratory experiments. However, some experimental laboratory conditions, such as temperature or infection dose, are regularly chosen based on convenience or convention, and it is unclear how these decisions systematically affect experimental outcomes. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of 58 laboratory studies that exposed amphibians to the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) to understand better how laboratory temperature, host life stage, infection dose, and host species affect host mortality. We found that host mortality was driven by thermal mismatches: hosts native to cooler environments experienced greater Bd-induced mortality at relatively warm experimental temperatures and vice versa. We also found that Bd dose positively predicted Bd-induced host mortality and that the superfamilies Bufonoidea and Hyloidea were especially susceptible to Bd. Finally, the effect of Bd on host mortality varied across host life stages, with larval amphibians experiencing lower risk of Bd-induced mortality than adults or metamorphs. Metamorphs were especially susceptible and experienced mortality when inoculated with much smaller Bd doses than the average dose used by researchers. Our results suggest that when designing experiments on species interactions, researchers should carefully consider the experimental temperature, inoculum dose, and life stage, and taxonomy of the host species.","964":"Health agencies have been widely adopting social media to disseminate important information, educate the public on emerging health issues, and understand public opinions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) widely used social media platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic to communicate with the public and mitigate the disease in the United States. It is crucial to understand the relationships between the CDC's social media communications and the actual epidemic metrics to improve public health agencies' communication strategies during health emergencies.Four major topics from the CDC's COVID-19 tweets were identified: (1) information on the prevention of health outcomes of COVID-19; (2) pediatric intervention and family safety; (3) updates of the epidemic situation of COVID-19; and (4) research and community engagement to curb COVID-19. Multivariate analyses showed that there were significant variabilities of progression between the CDC's topics and the actual COVID-19 epidemic measures. Some CDC topics showed substantial associations with the COVID-19 measures over different time spans throughout the pandemic, expressing similar temporal dynamics between these 2 types of time series data.This study aimed to identify key topics in tweets posted by the CDC during the pandemic, investigate the temporal dynamics between these key topics and the actual COVID-19 epidemic measures, and make recommendations for the CDC's digital health communication strategies for future health emergencies.Two types of data were collected: (1) a total of 17,524 COVID-19-related English tweets posted by the CDC between December 7, 2019, and January 15, 2022, and (2) COVID-19 epidemic measures in the United States from the public GitHub repository of Johns Hopkins University from January 2020 to July 2022. Latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling was applied to identify key topics from all COVID-19-related tweets posted by the CDC, and the final topics were determined by domain experts. Various multivariate time series analysis techniques were applied between each of the identified key topics and actual COVID-19 epidemic measures to quantify the dynamic associations between these 2 types of time series data.Our study is the first to comprehensively investigate the dynamic associations between topics discussed by the CDC on Twitter and the COVID-19 epidemic measures in the United States. We identified 4 major topic themes via topic modeling and explored how each of these topics was associated with each major epidemic measure by performing various multivariate time series analyses. We recommend that it is critical for public health agencies, such as the CDC, to update and disseminate timely and accurate information to the public and align major topics with key epidemic measures over time. We suggest that social media can help public health agencies to inform the public on health emergencies and to mitigate them effectively.","965":"-norm minimization on the difference matrices between the original relation matrices and the learned consistent ones subject to certain constraints.

We fit Cox models to assess 30-day readmissions as a function of these pollutants, adjusted for patient and hospital characteristics and ambient temperature. Analyses were then stratified by treating hospital performance on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services risk-standardized 30-day poststroke all-cause readmission measure to determine if the results were independent of performance: low (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rate for hospital 75th percentile), and intermediate (all others).Long-term exposure to air pollutants is associated with increased stroke incidence, morbidity, and mortality; however, research on the association of pollutant exposure with poststroke hospital readmissions is lacking.Long-term air pollutant exposure below national limits was associated with increased 30-day readmissions after stroke, regardless of hospital performance category. Whether air quality improvements lead to reductions in poststroke readmissions requires further research.Of 448 148 patients with stroke, 12.5% were readmitted within 30 days. Except for tropospheric NO2 (no national standard), average 2-year CO, O3, particulate matter 2.5, and SO2 values were below national limits. Each one SD increase in average annual CO, NO2, particulate matter 2.5, and SO2 exposure was associated with an adjusted 1.1% (95% CI, 0.4-1.9%), 3.6% (95% CI, 2.9%-4.4%), 1.2% (95% CI, 0.2%-2.3%), and 2.0% (95% CI, 1.1%-3.0%) increased risk of 30-day readmission, respectively, and O3 with a 0.7% (95% CI, 0.0%-1.5%) decrease. Associations between long-term air pollutant exposure and increased readmissions persisted across hospital performance categories.","967":"Prophylactic vaccination is a powerful tool for reducing the burden of infectious diseases, due to a combination of direct protection of vaccinees and indirect protection of others via herd immunity. Computational models play an important role in devising strategies for vaccination by making projections of its impacts on public health. Such projections are subject to uncertainty about numerous factors, however. For example, many vaccine efficacy trials focus on measuring protection against disease rather than protection against infection, leaving the extent of breakthrough infections (i.e., disease ameliorated but infection unimpeded) among vaccinees unknown. Our goal in this study was to quantify the extent to which uncertainty about breakthrough infections results in uncertainty about vaccination impact, with a focus on vaccines for dengue. To realistically account for the many forms of heterogeneity in dengue virus (DENV) transmission, which could have implications for the dynamics of indirect protection, we used a stochastic, agent-based model for DENV transmission informed by more than a decade of empirical studies in the city of Iquitos, Peru. Following 20 years of routine vaccination of nine-year-old children at 80% coverage, projections of the proportion of disease episodes averted varied by a factor of 1.76 (95% CI: 1.54-2.06) across the range of uncertainty about breakthrough infections. This was equivalent to the range of vaccination impact projected across a range of uncertainty about vaccine efficacy of 0.268 (95% CI: 0.210-0.329). Until uncertainty about breakthrough infections can be addressed empirically, our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for it in models of vaccination impact.","968":"Dogs are a potential source of drug-resistant Escherichia coli, but very few large-scale antimicrobial resistance surveillance studies have been conducted in the canine population. Here, we assess the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, identify temporal resistance and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) trends, and describe associations between resistance phenotypes among canine clinical E. coli isolates in the northeastern United States. Through a retrospective study design, we collected MICs from 7709 E. coli isolates from canine infections at the Cornell University Animal Health Diagnostic Center between 2007 and 2020. The available clinical data were limited to body site. Isolates were classified as resistant or susceptible to six (urinary) and 22 (non-urinary) antimicrobials based on Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints. We used the Mann-Kendall test (MKT) and Sen's slope to identify the presence of a significant trend in the percent of resistant isolates over the study period. Multivariable logistic regression (MLR) models were built with ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance as the outcome and either body site and isolation date, or resistance to other antimicrobials as predictors. MIC trends were characterized with survival analysis models, controlling for body site and year of isolation. Overall, 16.4% of isolates were resistant to enrofloxacin, 14.3% to ceftiofur, and 14% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The MKT and Sen's slope revealed a significant decreasing temporal trend for gentamicin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance among non-urinary isolates. No significant temporal resistance trends were detected by MKT for other antimicrobials. However, controlling for body-site in MLR models identified a decrease in resistance rates to enrofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole after 2010. Similarly, survival analysis data confirmed these findings and showed a decrease in MIC values after 2010 for gentamicin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, but an increase in cephalosporin MICs. MLR showed that non-urinary isolates were significantly more likely than urinary isolates to demonstrate in vitro resistance to ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole after controlling for year of isolation. We identified a higher level of ceftiofur resistance among enrofloxacin resistant isolates from urinary and non-urinary origins. Our findings confirmed that dogs are still a non-negligeable reservoir of drug-resistant E. coli in the northeastern United States. The increase in extended-spectrum cephalosporin MIC values in 2018-2020 compared to 2007-2010 constitutes a particularly worrying issue; the relationship between ceftiofur and enrofloxacin resistance suggests that the use of fluoroquinolones could contribute to this trend. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may be a good first-line choice for empiric treatment of E. coli infections; it is already recommended for canine urinary tract infections.","969":"The incidence of dengue has grown dramatically in recent decades worldwide, especially in Southeast Asia and the Americas with substantial transmission in 2014-2015. Yet the mechanisms underlying the spatio-temporal circulation of dengue virus (DENV) serotypes at large geographical scales remain elusive. Here we investigate the co-circulation in Asia of DENV serotypes 1-3 from 1956 to 2015, using a statistical framework that jointly estimates migration history and quantifies potential predictors of viral spatial diffusion, including socio-economic, air transportation and maritime mobility data. We find that the spread of DENV-1, -2 and -3 lineages in Asia is significantly associated with air traffic. Our analyses suggest the network centrality of air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India contribute to seeding dengue epidemics, whilst China, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Singapore may establish viral diffusion links with multiple countries in Asia. Phylogeographic reconstructions help to explain how growing air transportation networks could influence the dynamics of DENV circulation.","970":"Case investigation and contact tracing (CICT) are public health measures that aim to break the chain of pathogen transmission. Changes in viral characteristics of COVID-19 variants have likely affected the effectiveness of CICT programs. We estimated and compared the cases averted in Vermont when the original COVID-19 strain circulated (Nov. 25, 2020-Jan. 19, 2021) with two periods when the Delta strain dominated (Aug. 1-Sept. 25, 2021, and Sept. 26-Nov. 20, 2021). When the original strain circulated, we estimated that CICT prevented 7180 cases (55% reduction in disease burden), compared to 1437 (15% reduction) and 9970 cases (40% reduction) when the Delta strain circulated. Despite the Delta variant being more infectious and having a shorter latency period, CICT remained an effective tool to slow spread of COVID-19; while these viral characteristics did diminish CICT effectiveness, non-viral characteristics had a much greater impact on CICT effectiveness.","971":"Healthcare associated infections (HAIs) are costly but preventable. A limited understanding of the effects of environmental cleaning on the riskiest HAI associated pathogens is a current challenge in HAI prevention. This project aimed to quantify the effects of terminal hospital cleaning practices on HAI pathogens via environmental sampling in three hospitals located throughout the United States. Surfaces were swabbed from 36 occupied patient rooms with a laboratory-confirmed, hospital- or community-acquired infection of at least one of the four pathogens of interest (i.e., Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii), methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis\/faecium (VRE), and Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile)). Six nonporous, high touch surfaces (i.e., chair handrail, bed handrail, nurse call button, desk surface, bathroom counter near the sink, and a grab bar near the toilet) were sampled in each room for Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and the four pathogens of interest before and after terminal cleaning. The four pathogens of interest were detected on surfaces before and after terminal cleaning, but their levels were generally reduced. Overall, C. difficile was confirmed on the desk (n = 2), while MRSA (n = 24) and VRE (n = 25) were confirmed on all surface types before terminal cleaning. After cleaning, only MRSA (n = 6) on bed handrail, chair handrail, and nurse call button and VRE (n = 5) on bathroom sink, bed handrail, nurse call button, toilet grab bar, and C. difficile (n = 1) were confirmed. At 2 of the 3 hospitals, pathogens were generally reduced by >99% during terminal cleaning. One hospital showed that VRE increased after terminal cleaning, MRSA was reduced by 73% on the nurse call button, and VRE was reduced by only 50% on the bathroom sink. ATP detections did not correlate with any pathogen concentration. This study highlights the importance of terminal cleaning and indicates room for improvement in cleaning practices to reduce surface contamination throughout hospital rooms.","972":" in residence area is associated with more MetS risk factors. This association, however, is confounded by shared familial factors.","973":"In total, 1613 participants were assessed for eligibility and 1480 (92%) joined the trial, 1242 (84%) completed the trial and received prophylaxis (AL: 82% vs MV: 86%, p\u2009=\u20090.08); 157 (11%) were lost to follow-up (AL: 11% vs MV: 11%, p\u2009=\u20090.79); and 73 (5%) discontinued the drug (AL-7% vs MV-3%, p\u2009=\u20090.005). The AL arm was associated with discontinuation of the study drug (AL: 48\/738, 7% vs 25\/742, 3%; p\u2009=\u20090.01). Females (31\/345, 9%) were more likely (42\/1135, 4%) to discontinue taking drugs at some point in the trial (p\u2009=\u20090.005). Those (45\/644, 7%) who had no previous history of malaria infection were more likely to discontinue the study drug than those (28\/836, 3%) who had a history of malaria (p\u2009=\u20090.02). Engagement with the trial population was demanding because many types of forest work are illegal; and the involvement of an engagement team consisting of representatives from the local administration, health authorities, community leaders and community health workers played a significant role in building trust. Responsiveness to the needs and concerns of the community promoted acceptability and increased confidence in taking prophylaxis among participants. Recruitment of forest-goer volunteers to peer-supervise drug administration resulted in high compliance with drug intake. The development of locally-appropriate tools and messaging for the different linguistic and low-literacy groups was useful to ensure participants understood and adhered to the trial procedures. It was important to consider forest-goers` habits and social characteristics when planning the various trial activities.The comprehensive, participatory engagement strategy mobilized a wide range of stakeholders including study participants, helped build trust, and overcame potential ethical and practical challenges. This locally-adapted approach was highly effective as evidenced by high levels of trial enrolment, compliance with trial procedures and drug intake.The impact of engagement in terms of uptake was assessed as the proportion of people who participated during each stage of the trial: enrolment, compliance with trial procedures, and drug intake. During the trial, staff recorded the details of engagement meetings, including the views and opinions of participants and community representatives, the decision-making processes, and the challenges addressed during implementation.Malaria transmission in Southeast Asia is increasingly confined to forests, where marginalized groups are exposed primarily through their work. Anti-malarial chemoprophylaxis may help to protect these people. This article examines the effectiveness and practical challenges of engaging forest-goers to participate in a randomized controlled clinical trial of anti-malarial chemoprophylaxis with artemether-lumefantrine (AL) versus a control (multivitamin, MV) for malaria in northeast Cambodia.","974":"We aimed to investigate whether the Good School Toolkit reduced emotional violence, severe physical violence, sexual violence and injuries from school staff to students, as well as emotional, physical and sexual violence between peers, in Ugandan primary schools. We performed a two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial with parallel assignment. Forty-two schools in one district were allocated to intervention (n\u00a0=\u00a021) or wait-list control (n\u00a0=\u00a021) arms in 2012. We did cross-sectional baseline and endline surveys in 2012 and 2014, and the Good School Toolkit intervention was implemented for 18\u00a0months between surveys. Analyses were by intention to treat and are adjusted for clustering within schools and for baseline school-level proportions of outcomes. The Toolkit was associated with an overall reduction in any form of violence from staff and\/or peers in the past week towards both male (aOR\u00a0=\u00a00.34, 95%CI 0.22-0.53) and female students (aOR\u00a0=\u00a00.55, 95%CI 0.36-0.84). Injuries as a result of violence from school staff were also lower in male (aOR\u00a0=\u00a00.36, 95%CI 0.20-0.65) and female students (aOR\u00a0=\u00a00.51, 95%CI 0.29-0.90). Although the Toolkit seems to be effective at reducing violence in both sexes, there is some suggestion that the Toolkit may have stronger effects in boys than girls. The Toolkit is a promising intervention to reduce a wide range of different forms of violence from school staff and between peers in schools, and should be urgently considered for scale-up. Further research is needed to investigate how the intervention could engage more successfully with girls.","975":"To estimate the number of treatment initiations, averted fatal opioid overdoses, and the cost-effectiveness associated with offering buprenorphine-naloxone (buprenorphine) treatment on-site within existing syringe service programs (SSPs) in Massachusetts, USA.Cohort-based mathematical model and cost-effectiveness analysis. We derived model inputs from state and national surveillance data, clinical trials, and observational cohort studies. We compared an intervention scenario where 30% of SSP clients-initiated buprenorphine treatment on-site at least once annually to a status quo scenario where no buprenorphine was available onsite.Community treatment providers in Massachusetts, 2020-2030 PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). We assumed that 80% of SSP clients had recently injected drugs and that treatment within SSPs would have similar or improved retention compared with standard-of-care buprenorphine programs, but higher rates of active opioid use while in treatment.The status quo scenario resulted in 23,051 fatal overdoses and 1,511,613 treatment initiations over a 10-year simulation period. An intervention scenario with on-site SSP buprenorphine treatment averted 5,015 (-20.8%) fatal opioid overdoses and resulted in 129,359 (+8.6%) additional treatment initiations compared with the status quo. The intervention scenario was the dominating scenario: providing OUD treatment through Massachusetts SSPs cost less (-$3,600 per person), resulting in $775 million in total estimated savings over 10 years, with patients accumulating more QALYs (0.2 per person) compared with the status quo scenario.Number of treatment initiations (i.e., individuals began treatment on a medication for opioid use disorder or entered medically managed withdrawal), averted fatal opioid overdoses, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and lifetime discounted costs from a health sector and a limited societal perspective.Offering buprenorphine treatment on-site within syringe service programs has the potential to decrease fatal overdoses substantially, improve treatment engagement, and save on costs.","976":"Strongyloidiasis is a common neglected tropical disease in tropical and sub-tropical climatic zones. At the worldwide level, there is high uncertainty about the strongyloidiasis burden. This uncertainty represents an important knowledge gap since it affects the planning of interventions to reduce the burden of strongyloidiasis in endemic countries. This study aimed to estimate the global strongyloidiasis prevalence. A literature review was performed to obtain prevalence data from endemic countries at a worldwide level from 1990 to 2016. For each study, the true population prevalence was calculated by accounting for the specificity and the sensitivity of testing and age of tested individuals. Prediction of strongyloidiasis prevalence for each country was performed using a spatiotemporal statistical modeling approach. The country prevalence obtained from the model was used to estimate the number of infected people per country. We estimate the global prevalence of strongyloidiasis in 2017 to be 8.1% (95% CI: 4.2-12.4%), corresponding to 613.9 (95% CI: 313.1-910.1) million people infected. The South-East Asia, African, and Western Pacific Regions accounted for 76.1% of the global infections. Our results could be used to identify those countries in which strongyloidiasis prevalence is highest and where mass drug administration (MDA) should be deployed for its prevention and control.","977":"Because arterial stiffness increases following menopause, estrogen may be a protective factor. Our previous work indicates that the GPER (G protein-coupled estrogen receptor) mediates estrogen's vascular actions. In the current study, we assessed arterial stiffening using pulse wave velocity (PWV), a clinically relevant measurement that independently predicts cardiovascular mortality. We hypothesized that genetic deletion of GPER would attenuate sex differences in PWV and would be associated with changes in passive vascular mechanics. Control and Ang II (angiotensin II)-infused male and female wild-type and GPER knockout mice were assessed for blood pressure, intracarotid PWV, cardiac function, passive biaxial mechanics, constitutive modeling, and histology. Sex differences in PWV and left ventricular mass were detected in wild-type mice but absent in GPER knockout and Ang II-infused mice, regardless of genotype. Despite lower PWV, the material stiffness of female wild-type carotids was greater than males in control conditions and was maintained in response to Ang II due to increased wall thickness. PWV positively correlated with unloaded thickness as well as circumferential and axial stiffness only in females. In contrast, blood pressure positively associated with circumferential and axial stiffness in males. Taken together, we found that female wild-type mice were unique in their vascular adaptation to hypertension by increasing wall thickness to maintain stiffness. Given that carotid arteries are easily accessible clinically, systematic assessment of intracarotid PWV in women may provide insight into vascular damage that cannot be assumed from blood pressure measurements alone.","978":"Although vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have now been found safe and efficacious, there remains an urgent global health need to test both these vaccines and additional vaccines against the same virus. Under variable conditions, either standard or unusual designs would for both familiar and often-missed reasons make continued testing possible and ethical.","979":"Using data from a US web-based sexual network study of MSM between 2017 and 2019, we measured PrEP usage and assessed whether respondents met indications for PrEP. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate the relationship between PrEP indications and PrEP use, with adjustment for geography, age and race\/ethnicity.Indications for PrEP strongly predicted current PrEP use among US MSM. However, we identified substantial misalignment between indications and use in both directions (indicated MSM who were not benefitting from PrEP, and MSM taking PrEP while not presently being indicated). PrEP underuse by those at greatest risk for HIV acquisition may limit the projected impact of PrEP implementation, despite reported increases in PrEP provision. This calls for further implementation efforts to improve PrEP delivery to those most in need during periods of elevated sexual risk and to close the gap between indications and uptake.HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective in preventing HIV transmission. United States Public Health Service (USPHS) clinical practice guidelines define biobehavioral indications for initiation. To assess guideline implementation, it is critical to quantify PrEP nonusers who are indicated and PrEP users who are not indicated. We sought to estimate current PrEP use among US men who have sex with men (MSM), characterize whether their PrEP use aligned with their current indications for PrEP, and assess whether the association between PrEP indications and PrEP use differed by demography or geography.Of 3508 sexually active, HIV-negative MSM, 34% met indications for PrEP. The proportion with current PrEP use was 32% among MSM meeting indications and 11% among those without indications. Nearly 40% of those currently using PrEP did not meet indications for PrEP, and 68% of MSM with indications for PrEP were not currently using PrEP. After adjusting for geography and demographics, MSM with PrEP indications were about three times as likely to be currently using PrEP. This association varied slightly, but not significantly, by geographic region, age and race\/ethnicity.","980":"The increasing frequency of zoonotic disease events underscores a need to develop forecasting tools toward a more preemptive approach to outbreak investigation. We apply machine learning to data describing the traits and zoonotic pathogen diversity of the most speciose group of mammals, the rodents, which also comprise a disproportionate number of zoonotic disease reservoirs. Our models predict reservoir status in this group with over 90% accuracy, identifying species with high probabilities of harboring undiscovered zoonotic pathogens based on trait profiles that may serve as rules of thumb to distinguish reservoirs from nonreservoir species. Key predictors of zoonotic reservoirs include biogeographical properties, such as range size, as well as intrinsic host traits associated with lifetime reproductive output. Predicted hotspots of novel rodent reservoir diversity occur in the Middle East and Central Asia and the Midwestern United States.","981":"The emergence and reemergence of coronavirus epidemics sparked renewed concerns from global epidemiology researchers and public health administrators. Mathematical models that represented how contact tracing and follow-up may control Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) transmissions were developed for evaluating different infection control interventions, estimating likely number of infections as well as facilitating understanding of their likely epidemiology. We reviewed mathematical models for contact tracing and follow-up control measures of SARS and MERS transmission. Model characteristics, epidemiological parameters and intervention parameters used in the mathematical models from seven studies were summarized. A major concern identified in future epidemics is whether public health administrators can collect all the required data for building epidemiological models in a short period of time during the early phase of an outbreak. Also, currently available models do not explicitly model constrained resources. We urge for closed-loop communication between public health administrators and modelling researchers to come up with guidelines to delineate the collection of the required data in the midst of an outbreak and the inclusion of additional logistical details in future similar models.","982":"Strong and supportive social relationships are fundamental to our well-being. However, there are costs to their maintenance, resulting in a trade-off between quality and quantity, a typical strategy being to put a lot of effort on a few high-intensity relationships while maintaining larger numbers of less close relationships. It has also been shown that there are persistent individual differences in this pattern; some individuals allocate their efforts more uniformly across their networks, while others strongly focus on their closest relationships. Furthermore, some individuals maintain more stable networks than others. Here, we focus on how personality traits of individuals affect this picture, using mobile phone calls records and survey data from the Mobile Territorial Lab (MTL) study. In particular, we look at the relationship between personality traits and the (i) persistence of social signatures, namely the similarity of the social signature shape of an individual measured in different time intervals; (ii) the turnover in egocentric networks, that is, differences in the set of alters present at two consecutive temporal intervals; and (iii) the rank dynamics defined as the variation of alter rankings in egocentric networks in consecutive intervals. We observe that some traits have effects on the stability of the social signatures as well as network turnover and rank dynamics. As an example, individuals who score highly in the Openness to Experience trait tend to have higher levels of network turnover and larger alter rank variations. On broader terms, our study shows that personality traits clearly affect the ways in which individuals maintain their personal networks.","983":"Using up to 12 predictive patient characteristics (with a minimum of 3, depending on what information is available), the calculator provides the probability that a donor may have infectious vs non-infectious encephalitis, improving the prediction accuracy over current practices. These characteristics include gender, fever, immunocompromised state (other than HIV), cerebrospinal fluid elevation, altered mental status, psychiatric features, cranial nerve abnormality, meningeal signs, focal motor weakness, Babinski's sign, movement disorder, and sensory abnormalities.In the absence of definitive diagnostic testing in a potential organ donor, infectious encephalitis can be predicted with a risk score. The risk calculator presented in this paper represents a prototype, establishing a framework that can be expanded to other infectious diseases transmissible through solid organ transplantation.There were 13 documented clusters of infectious encephalitis transmission via organ transplant from deceased donors to recipients during 2002-2013. Hence, organs from donors diagnosed with encephalitis are often declined because of concerns about the possibility of infection, given that there is no quick and simple test to detect causes of infectious encephalitis.We constructed a database containing cases of infectious and non-infectious encephalitis. Using statistical imputation, cross-validation, and regression techniques, we determined deceased organ donor characteristics, including demographics, signs, symptoms, physical exam, and laboratory findings, predictive of infectious vs non-infectious encephalitis, and developed a calculator which assesses the risk of infection.","984":"As Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread, characterization of its antibody epitopes, emerging strains, related coronaviruses, and even the human proteome in naturally infected patients can guide the development of effective vaccines and therapies. Since traditional epitope identification tools are dependent upon pre-defined peptide sequences, they are not readily adaptable to diverse viral proteomes. The Serum Epitope Repertoire Analysis (SERA) platform leverages a high diversity random bacterial display library to identify proteome-independent epitope binding specificities which are then analyzed in the context of organisms of interest. When evaluating immune response in the context of SARS-CoV-2, we identify dominant epitope regions and motifs which demonstrate potential to classify mild from severe disease and relate to neutralization activity. We highlight SARS-CoV-2 epitopes that are cross-reactive with other coronaviruses and demonstrate decreased epitope signal for mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains. Collectively, the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 mutants towards reduced antibody response highlight the importance of data-driven development of the vaccines and therapies to treat COVID-19.","985":"SARS-CoV-2 has infected nearly 3.7 million and killed 61,722 Californians, as of May 22, 2021. Non-pharmaceutical interventions have been instrumental in mitigating the spread of the coronavirus. However, as we ease restrictions, widespread implementation of COVID-19 vaccines is essential to prevent its resurgence. In this work, we addressed the adequacy and deficiency of vaccine uptake within California and the possibility and severity of resurgence of COVID-19 as restrictions are lifted given the current vaccination rates. We implemented a real-time Bayesian data assimilation approach to provide projections of incident cases and deaths in California following the reopening of its economy on June 15, 2021. We implemented scenarios that vary vaccine uptake prior to reopening, and transmission rates and effective population sizes following the reopening. For comparison purposes, we adopted a baseline scenario using the current vaccination rates, which projects a total 11,429 cases and 429 deaths in a 15-day period after reopening. We used posterior estimates based on CA historical data to provide realistic model parameters after reopening. When the transmission rate is increased after reopening, we projected an increase in cases by 21.8% and deaths by 4.4% above the baseline after reopening. When the effective population is increased after reopening, we observed an increase in cases by 51.8% and deaths by 12.3% above baseline. A 30% reduction in vaccine uptake alone has the potential to increase cases and deaths by 35% and 21.6%, respectively. Conversely, increasing vaccine uptake by 30% could decrease cases and deaths by 26.1% and 17.9%, respectively. As California unfolds its plan to reopen its economy on June 15, 2021, it is critical that social distancing and public behavior changes continue to be promoted, particularly in communities with low vaccine uptake. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendation to ease mask-wearing for fully vaccinated individuals despite major inequities in vaccine uptake in counties across the state highlights some of the logistical challenges that society faces as we enthusiastically phase out of this pandemic.","986":"Our study aims to investigate the dynamics of conventional memory T cells (Tconv) and regulatory memory T cells (Treg) following activation, and to explore potential differences between these two cell types. To achieve this, we developed advanced statistical mixed models based on mathematical models of ordinary differential equations (ODE), which allowed us to transform post-vaccination immunological processes into mathematical formulas. These models were applied to in-house data from a de novo Hepatitis B vaccination trial. By accounting for inter- and intra-individual variability, our models provided good fits for both antigen-specific Tconv and Treg cells, overcoming the challenge of studying these complex processes. Our modeling approach provided a deeper understanding of the immunological processes underlying T cell development after vaccination. Specifically, our analysis revealed several important findings regarding the dynamics of Tconv and Treg cells, as well as their relationship to seropositivity for Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1) and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), and the dynamics of antibody response to vaccination. Firstly, our modeling indicated that Tconv dynamics suggest the existence of two T cell types, in contrast to Treg dynamics where only one T cell type is predicted. Secondly, we found that individuals who converted to a positive antibody response to the vaccine earlier had lower decay rates for both Tregs and Tconv cells, which may have important implications for the development of more effective vaccination strategies. Additionally, our modeling showed that HSV-1 seropositivity negatively influenced Tconv cell expansion after the second vaccination, while EBV seropositivity was associated with higher Treg expansion rates after vaccination. Overall, this study provides a critical foundation for understanding the dynamic processes underlying T cell development after vaccination.","987":"Retrospective cohort.In this, the largest and only multicenter study to investigate SSI risk following cesarean delivery by primary payer, Medicaid-insured women had a higher risk of infection than privately insured women. These findings suggest the need to evaluate and better characterize the quality of maternal healthcare for and needs of women covered by Medicaid to inform targeted infection prevention and policy.Deliveries reported to NHSN and state inpatient discharge databases were linked to identify SSIs in the 30 days following cesarean delivery, primary payer, and patient and procedure characteristics. Additional hospital-level characteristics were obtained from public databases. Relative risk of SSI by primary payer primary payer was assessed using multivariable logistic regression adjusting for patient, procedure, and hospital characteristics, accounting for facility-level clustering.To compare risk of surgical site infection (SSI) following cesarean delivery between women covered by Medicaid and private health insurance.Of 291,757 cesarean deliveries included, 48% were covered by Medicaid. SSIs were detected following 1,055 deliveries covered by Medicaid (0.75%) and 955 deliveries covered by private insurance (0.63%) (unadjusted odds ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-1.3; P < .0001). The adjusted odds of SSI following cesarean deliveries covered by Medicaid was 1.4 (95% CI, 1.2-1.6; P < .0001) times the odds of those covered by private insurance.Cesarean deliveries covered by Medicaid or private insurance and reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) and state inpatient discharge databases by hospitals in California (2011-2013).","988":"The 4 dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1-4) cause the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease of humans worldwide. DENV-2 Asian 1 (A1) genotype viruses replaced the Asian-American (AA) genotype in Vietnam and Cambodia, after which A1 viruses containing Q or M at envelope (E) residue 160 became more prevalent than those with residue 160K in both countries (2008-2011). We investigated whether these substitutions conferred a fitness advantage by measuring neutralizing antibody titer against reporter virus particles (RVPs) representing AA, A1-160K, A1-160Q, and A1-160M, using patient sera from Vietnam and a well-characterized Nicaraguan cohort. Surprisingly, we found that A1-160Q and A1-160M RVPs were better neutralized by heterologous antisera than A1-160K. Despite this, Vietnamese patients infected with A1-160Q or A1-160M viruses had higher viremia levels than those infected with A1-160K. We thus found that independent lineages in Vietnam and Cambodia acquired a substitution in E that significantly increased polyclonal neutralization but nonetheless were successful in disseminating and infecting human hosts. ","989":"We obtained 21 LAC and paired adjacent normal formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded lung tissues from patients who underwent curative resection for stage I LAC. We compared expression levels of eight miRNAs involved in the DNA repair mechanism between LAC and adjacent tissues.We aimed at exploring biological functions of differentially expressed miRNAs during carcinogenesis, to identify miRNAs dysegulations involved in DNA repair mechanisms, and to evaluate potential of miRNAs as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers for early lung adenocarcinomas (LAC).Expressions of Hsa-miR-9-5p, hsa-miR-24-3p, hsa-miR-125a-3p, hsa-miR- 125b-5p, hsa-miR-155-5p, and hsa-let-7a-5p were significantly up-regulated in stage I LAC tissues compared with those in the adjacent tissues. In addition, expressions of hsa-mir-9-5p, hsa-mir-24-3p, hsa-mir-125a-3p, hsa-mir-125b-5p, and hsa-mir-155-5p were significantly up-regulated in stage Ia LAC tissues, whereas expressions of hsa-mir- 125a-3p and hsa-mir-125b-5p were significantly up-regulated in stage Ib LAC tissues. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that AUROC of hsa-mir-125b- 5p was 0.875 (P < 0.001).Expression of hsa-mir-125b-5p could be used to distinguish LAC from adjacent tissues. Our result suggests that hsa-mir125b-5p can be a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker for LAC.","990":"Public health decision makers rely on hospitalization forecasts to inform COVID-19 pandemic planning and resource allocation. Hospitalization forecasts are most relevant when they are accurate, made available quickly, and updated frequently. We rapidly adapted an agent-based model (ABM) to provide weekly 30-day hospitalization forecasts (i.e., demand for intensive care unit [ICU] beds and non-ICU beds) by state and region in North Carolina for public health decision makers. The ABM was based on a synthetic population of North Carolina residents and included movement of agents (i.e., patients) among North Carolina hospitals, nursing homes, and the community. We assigned SARS-CoV-2 infection to agents using county-level compartmental models and determined agents' COVID-19 severity and probability of hospitalization using synthetic population characteristics (e.g., age, comorbidities). We generated weekly 30-day hospitalization forecasts during May-December 2020 and evaluated the impact of major model updates on statewide forecast accuracy under a SARS-CoV-2 effective reproduction number range of 1.0-1.2. Of the 21 forecasts included in the assessment, the average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was 7.8% for non-ICU beds and 23.6% for ICU beds. Among the major model updates, integration of near-real-time hospital occupancy data into the model had the largest impact on improving forecast accuracy, reducing the average MAPE for non-ICU beds from 6.6% to 3.9% and for ICU beds from 33.4% to 6.5%. Our results suggest that future pandemic hospitalization forecasting efforts should prioritize early inclusion of hospital occupancy data to maximize accuracy.","991":"Drug resistance poses a serious challenge for the control of tuberculosis in many settings. It is well established that the expected future trend in resistance depends on the reproductive fitness of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, the variability in fitness between strains with different resistance-conferring mutations has been largely ignored when making these predictions.We developed a novel approach for incorporating the variable fitness costs of drug resistance-conferring mutations and for tracking this distribution of fitness costs over time within a transmission model. We used this approach to describe the effects of realistic fitness cost distributions on the future prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis.The shape of the distribution of fitness costs was a strong predictor of the long-term prevalence of resistance. While, as expected, lower average fitness costs of drug resistance-conferring mutations were associated with more severe epidemics of drug-resistant tuberculosis, fitness distributions with greater variance also led to higher levels of drug resistance. For example, compared to simulations in which the fitness cost of resistance was fixed, introducing a realistic amount of variance resulted in a 40% increase in prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis after 20 years.The differences in the fitness costs associated with drug resistance-conferring mutations are a key determinant of the future burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Future studies that can better establish the range of fitness costs associated with drug resistance-conferring mutations will improve projections and thus facilitate better public health planning efforts.","992":"Ugandan adolescent girls and young women are disproportionately impacted by human immunodeficiency virus, and this is largely driven by their engagement in transactional sex. Globally, parent-daughter communication about sex is associated with increased contraceptive use and delayed\/decreased sexual activity, but research on parent-daughter communication about transactional sex is lacking. This paper elucidates local perspectives on, and experiences of parent-daughter communication about sex and transactional sex, to inform family-level comprehensive sexuality education interventions.We found that parents used three approaches to discuss sex and transactional sex with their daughters: (1) frightening their daughters into avoiding sex; (2) being \"strict\"; and (3) relying on mothers rather than fathers to \"counsel\" daughters. Mother-daughter communication about transactional sex was common, but frequently unidirectional. Adolescent girls and young women bringing home gifts sparked conversations about the risks of transactional sex, although less in poorer households. Mothers felt they lacked control over their daughters' sexual behaviors and thus restricted their movements and friendships to try to prevent them from having sex. In contrast to previous research, we found some evidence of mothers encouraging condom use and father-daughter communication about sex.We conducted a secondary, thematic analysis of 13 focus group discussions (n\u2009=\u2009119) and 30 in-depth interviews collected between 2014 and 2015 with adolescent girls and young women aged 14+,\u00a0and men and women in Kampala and Masaka.Family-level comprehensive sexuality education interventions targeting parent-daughter communication about sex could further highlight the role that fathers might play, and emphasize communication about the inequitable power dynamics in transactional sex and condom negotiation skills, while reducing fear surrounding parent-daughter communication.","993":"The 2014 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa was the largest and longest ever reported since the first identification of this disease. We propose a compartmental model for EVD dynamics, including virus transmission in the community, at hospitals, and at funerals. Using time-dependent parameters, we incorporate the increasing intensity of intervention efforts. Fitting the system to the early phase of the 2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak, we estimate the basic reproduction number as 1.44. We derive a final size relation which allows us to forecast the total number of cases during the outbreak when effective interventions are in place. Our model predictions show that, as long as cases are reported in any country, intervention strategies cannot be dismissed. Since the main driver in the current slowdown of the epidemic is not the depletion of susceptibles, future waves of infection might be possible, if control measures or population behavior are relaxed. ","994":"Harmful cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) exposures can cause illness or death in humans and animals. We characterized American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) Animal Poison Control Center (APCC) harmful blue-green algae (HBGA) call data, compared it to a measure of harmful algal bloom public awareness, and considered its suitability as a public health information source. ASPCA APCC dog and cat \"HBGA exposure\" calls made 1 January 2010-31 December 2022 were included. We calculated annual HBGA call percentages and described calls (species, month, origin, exposure route). We characterized public awareness by quantifying Nexis Uni\u00ae (LexisNexis Academic; New York, NY, USA)-indexed news publications (2010-2022) pertaining to \"harmful algal bloom(s)\". Call percentage increased annually, from 0.005% (2010) to 0.070% (2022). Of 999 HBGA calls, 99.4% (n = 993) were dog exposures. Over 65% (n = 655) of calls were made July-September, largely from the New England (n = 154 (15.4%)) and Pacific (n = 129 (12.9.%)) geographic divisions. Oral and dermal exposures predominated (n = 956 (95.7%)). Harmful algal bloom news publications increased overall, peaking in 2019 (n = 1834). Higher call volumes in summer and in the New England and Pacific geographic divisions drove HBGA call increases; public awareness might have contributed. Dogs and humans have similar exposure routes. ASPCA APCC HBGA call data could serve as a public health information source.","995":"We extracted the data for the uptake of pentavalent vaccine (first, second and third dose) given to children aged between 6 weeks and 23 months from immunisation records for January-June 2019 before immunisation service integration and July-December 2019 after immunisation service integration from the District Health Information System 2 website to estimate the immunisation uptake ratios and drop-out rates.Integration of immunisation service delivery to nutrition sites and children's outpatient departments improved the immunisation coverage and decreased drop-out rates in the Rumbek East and Rumbek Centre counties of South Sudan. This evidence of positive impact should encourage the stakeholders of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation to focus on the sustainability and scale-up of this intervention to other counties in South Sudan, as logistically as possible.The uptake of the first dose of the pentavalent vaccine improved from 61% to 96% (p<0.001) after immunisation service integration into the nutrition programmes of the primary healthcare centres in Rumbek Centre county. The uptake of the second pentavalent dose improved from 37% to 69% (p<0.001) and for the third pentavalent dose from 36% to 62% (p<0.001), while the drop-out rate reduced from 57% to 40% (p<0.001). While in Rumbek East county, the uptake of the first dose of the pentavalent vaccine improved from 55% to 77% (p<0.001) after immunisation service integration into the under 5-year-old paediatric outpatient departments. The uptake of the second dose improved from 36% to 62% (p<0.001) and for the third dose from 44% to 63% (p<0.001), while the drop-out rate reduced from 40% to 28% (p<0.001). Children were 23% more likely (RR 1.23, 95%\u2009CI 1.12 to 1.36, p<0.001) to be immunised with the first dose of the pentavalent vaccine on immunisation service integration into the nutrition programmes of primary healthcare centres of Rumbek Centre county in comparison to integration into under 5-year-old outpatient departments of Rumbek East county.Three primary healthcare centres in Rumbek East county and three primary healthcare centres in Rumbek Centre county of Lakes state in South Sudan.To evaluate the impact of immunisation service integration to nutrition programmes and under 5-year-old paediatric outpatient departments of primary healthcare centres in Rumbek East and Rumbek Centre counties of South Sudan.Retrospective intervention study.","996":"Here, we aimed to explore the influence of integrating income-associated differences in parameters of traditional dynamic transmission models. We developed a measles SIR model, in which the Susceptible, Infected and Recovered classes were stratified by income quintile, with income-specific transmission rates, disease-induced mortality rates, and vaccination coverage levels. We further provided a stylized illustration with secondary data from Ethiopia, where we examined various scenarios demonstrating differences in transmission patterns by income and in distributional vaccination coverage, and quantified impacts on disparities in measles mortality.The incorporation of income-specific differences can reveal distinct outbreak patterns across income groups and important differences in the subsequent effects of preventative interventions like vaccination. Our case study highlights the need to extend traditional modeling frameworks (e.g. SIR models) to be stratified by socioeconomic factors like income and to consider ensuing income-associated differences in disease-related morbidity and mortality. In so doing, we build on existing tools and characterize ongoing challenges in achieving health equity.The income-stratified SIR model exhibited similar dynamics to that of the traditional SIR model, with amplified outbreak peaks and measles mortality among the poorest income group. All vaccination coverage strategies were found to substantially curb the overall number of measles deaths, yet most considerably for the poorest, with select strategies yielding clear reductions in measles mortality disparities.Deterministic compartmental models of infectious diseases like measles typically reflect biological heterogeneities in the risk of infection and severity to characterize transmission dynamics. Given the known association of socioeconomic status and increased vulnerability to infection and mortality, it is also critical that such models further incorporate social heterogeneities.","997":" of strains increased sharply in Europe around 1995 and in Latin America around 2005. Principal component analysis on noncore genes showed a clear distinction between strains from Europe and Latin America, whereas the plasmid gene content was similar. Regardless of the evolutionary separation, similar features of resistance to \u03b2-lactams and quinolones\/fluoroquinolones indicated parallel evolution of antimicrobial resistance in both regions.","998":"China had conducted some of the most stringent public health measures to control the spread of successive SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, the effectiveness of these measures and their impacts on the associated disease burden have rarely been quantitatively assessed at the national level. To address this gap, we developed a stochastic age-stratified metapopulation model that incorporates testing, contact tracing and isolation, based on 419 million travel movements among 366 Chinese cities. The study period for this model began from September 2022. The COVID-19 disease burden was evaluated, considering 8 types of underlying health conditions in the Chinese population. We identified the marginal effects between the testing speed and reduction in the epidemic duration. The findings suggest that assuming a vaccine coverage of 89%, the Omicron-like wave could be suppressed by 3-day interval population-level testing (PLT), while it would become endemic with 4-day interval PLT, and without testing, it would result in an epidemic. PLT conducted every 3 days would not only eliminate infections but also keep hospital bed occupancy at less than 29.46% (95% CI, 22.73-38.68%) of capacity for respiratory illness and ICU bed occupancy at less than 58.94% (95% CI, 45.70-76.90%) during an outbreak. Furthermore, the underlying health conditions would lead to an extra 2.35 (95% CI, 1.89-2.92) million hospital admissions and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.13-0.2) million ICU admissions. Our study provides insights into health preparedness to balance the disease burden and sustainability for a country with a population of billions.","999":"Despite expanded antiretroviral therapy (ART) eligibility in South Africa, many people diagnosed with HIV do not initiate ART promptly, yet understanding of the reasons is limited. Using data from an 8-month prospective cohort interview study of women and men newly-diagnosed with HIV in three public-sector primary care clinics in the eThekwini (Durban) region, South Africa, 2010-2014, we examined if theoretically-relevant social-structural, social-cognitive, psychosocial, and health status indicators were associated with time to ART initiation. Of 459 diagnosed, 350 returned to the clinic for their CD4+ test results (linkage); 153 (33.3%) were ART-eligible according to treatment criteria at the time; 115 (75.2% of those eligible) initiated ART (median = 12.86 weeks [95% CI: 9.75, 15.97] after linkage). In adjusted Cox proportional hazard models, internalized stigma was associated with a 65% decrease in the rate of ART initiation (Adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 0.35, 95% CI: 0.19-0.80) during the period less than four weeks after linkage to care, but not four or more weeks after linkage to care, suggesting that stigma-reduction interventions implemented shortly after diagnosis may accelerate ART uptake. As reported by others, older age was associated with more rapid ART initiation (AHR for 1-year age increase: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07) and higher CD4+ cell count (\u2265300\u03bcL vs. <150\u03bcL) was associated with a lower rate of initiation (AHR 0.38, 95% CI: 0.19-0.80). Several other factors that were assessed prior to diagnosis, including stronger belief in traditional medicine, higher endorsement of stigma toward people living with HIV, food insecurity, and higher psychological distress, were found to be in the expected direction of association with ART initiation, but confidence intervals were wide and could not exclude a null finding.","1000":"In February 2021, Colombia began mass vaccination against COVID-19 using mainly BNT162b2 and CoronaVac vaccines. We aimed to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) to prevent COVID-19 symptomatic cases, hospitalization, critical care admission, and deaths in a cohort of 796,072 insured subjects older than 40 years in northern Colombia, a setting with a high SARS-CoV-2 transmission.We identified individuals vaccinated between March 1st of 2021 and August 15th of 2021. We included symptomatic cases, hospitalizations, critical care admissions, and deaths in patients with confirmed COVID-19 as main outcomes. We calculated VE for each outcome from the hazard ratio in Cox proportionally hazards regressions (adjusted by age, sex, place of residence, diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus, cancer, hypertension, tuberculosis, neurological diseases, and chronic renal disease), with 95% confidence intervals (CI).A total of 719,735 insured participants of 40 and more years were followed. We found 21,545 laboratory-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 among unvaccinated population, along with 2874 hospitalizations, 1061 critical care admissions, and 1329 deaths, for a rate of 207.2 per million person-days, 27.1 per million person-days, 10.0 per million person-days, and 12.5 per million person-days, respectively. We found CoronaVac was not effective for any outcome in subjects above 80 years old; but for people 40-79 years of age, we found two doses of CoronaVac reduced hospitalization (33.1%; 95% CI, 14.5-47.7), critical care admission (47.2%; 95% CI, 18.5-65.8), and death (55.7%; 95% CI, 32.5-70.0). We found BNT162b2 was effective for all outcomes in the entire population of subjects above 40 years of age, significantly declining for subjects \u226580 years.Two doses of either CoronaVac in population between 40 and 79 years of age, or BNT162b2 among vaccinated above 40 years old significantly reduced deaths of confirmed COVID-19 in a cohort of individuals from Colombia.

The method uses indirect information based on social network of each participant taken from the general population, but in some applications a fast computational approach would be highly recommended. We propose a Gibbs sampling method and a Monte Carlo approach to sample from the random degree model. We applied the abovementioned analytical strategies to previous data on heavy drug users from Curitiba, Brazil.","1002":"A convenience sample of participants with professional experience evaluating DDI evidence was recruited. Participants independently evaluated pre-selected evidence items for 5 drug pairs using the new instrument. For each drug pair, participants labeled each evidence item as sufficient or insufficient to establish the existence of a DDI based on the evidence categories provided by the instrument. Participants also decided if the overall body of evidence supported a DDI involving the drug pair. Agreement was computed both at the evidence item and drug pair levels. A cut-off of\u00a0\u2265\u00a070% was chosen as the agreement threshold for percent agreement, while a coefficient\u00a0>\u00a00.6 was used as the cut-off for chance-corrected agreement. Open ended comments were collected and coded to identify themes related to the participants' experience using the novel approach.Even though the key findings were negative, the study's results shed light on how experts approach DDI evidence assessment, including the importance situating evidence assessment within the context of consideration of clinical relevance. Analysis of participant comments within the context of the negative findings identified several promising future research directions including: novel computer-based support for evidence assessment; formal evaluation of a more comprehensive evidence assessment approach that requires consideration of specific, explicitly stated, clinical consequences; and more formal investigation of DDI case report assessment instruments.\u00a0=\u00a00.24, Conger's Kappa\u00a0=\u00a00.24). Participant comments suggested several possible reasons for the disagreements including unaddressed subjectivity in assessing an evidence item's type and study design, an infeasible separation of evidence evaluation from the consideration of clinical relevance, and potential issues related to the evaluation of DDI case reports.Low concordance between drug-drug interaction (DDI) knowledge bases is a well-documented concern. One potential cause of inconsistency is variability between drug experts in approach to assessing evidence about potential DDIs. In this study, we examined the face validity and inter-rater reliability of a novel DDI evidence evaluation instrument designed to be simple and easy to use.","1003":", a devastating infectious fungus of amphibians, using multiple methods trained on time-incremented subsets of the available data. We split our data into timeline-based training and testing sets, and evaluated models on each set using standard performance criteria, including AUC, kappa, false negative rate and the Boyce index. Of eight models examined, we found that boosted regression trees and random forests performed best, closely followed by MaxEnt. As expected, predictive performance generally improved with the length of time series used for model training. These results provide information on how quickly the potential extent of an emerging disease may be determined, and identify which modelling frameworks are likely to provide useful information during the early phases of pathogen expansion.","1004":"Schools play a central role in the transmission of many respiratory infections. Heterogeneous social contact patterns associated with the social structures of schools (i.e., classes\/grades) are likely to influence the within-school transmission dynamics, but data-driven evidence on fine-scale transmission patterns between students has been limited. Using a mathematical model, we analyzed a large-scale dataset of seasonal influenza outbreaks in Matsumoto city, Japan, to infer social interactions within and between classes\/grades from observed transmission patterns. While the relative contribution of within-class and within-grade transmissions to the reproduction number varied with the number of classes per grade, the overall within-school reproduction number, which determines the initial growth of cases and the risk of sustained transmission, was only minimally associated with class sizes and the number of classes per grade. This finding suggests that interventions that change the size and number of classes, e.g., splitting classes and staggered attendance, may have a limited effect on the control of school outbreaks. We also found that vaccination and mask-wearing of students were associated with reduced susceptibility (vaccination and mask-wearing) and infectiousness (mask-wearing), and hand washing was associated with increased susceptibility. Our results show how analysis of fine-grained transmission patterns between students can improve understanding of within-school disease dynamics and provide insights into the relative impact of different approaches to outbreak control.","1005":"Epidemiologic research questions often focus on evaluating binary outcomes, yet curricula and scientific literature do not always provide clear guidance or examples on selecting and calculating an appropriate measure of association in these scenarios. Reporting inappropriate measures may lead to misleading statistical conclusions. We present a hands-on tutorial that includes annotated code written in an open-source statistical programming language (R) showing readers how to apply, compare, and understand four methods used to estimate a risk or prevalence ratio (or difference), rather than presenting an odds ratio. We will provide guidance on when to use each method, discuss the strengths and limitations of each approach, and compare the results obtained across them. Ultimately, we aim to help trainees, public health researchers, and interdisciplinary professionals develop an intuition for these methods and empower them to implement and interpret these methods in their own research.","1006":"Seasonal variation makes Schistosoma transmission less sustainable and easier to control than predicted by earlier modeling studies.We used mathematical analysis and numerical simulation to estimate the impact of seasonality on disease dynamics and control outcomes, and to evaluate whether seasonal averaging or intermediate-host reduction can provide reliable predictions of control outcomes. We also examined whether seasonality could be used as leverage in creation of effective control strategies.A seasonal transmission environment including seasonal variation of snail population density and human-snail contact patterns can affect the dynamics of Schistosoma infection and the success of control interventions. In projecting control outcomes, conventional modeling approaches have often ignored seasonality by using simplified intermediate-host modeling, or by restricting seasonal effects through use of yearly averaging.We found models that used seasonal averaging could grossly overestimate infection burden and underestimate control outcomes in highly seasonal environments. We showed that proper intra-seasonal timing of control measures could make marked improvement on the long-term burden reduction for Schistosoma transmission control, and we identified the optimal timing for each intervention. Seasonal snail control, implemented alone, was less effective than mass drug administration, but could provide additive impact in reaching control and elimination targets.","1007":"=99.83%), precluding pooled averages, and meta-regression analyses revealed that these variations were explained by country income status and participant characteristics but not by methodological differences in AST. Also, no significant secular changes in MRSA prevalence or resistance proportions in Asia-Pacific were found.This review included studies reporting MRSA prevalence between 2000 and 2016. Studies were excluded if they did not contain complete information on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) methods. Primary outcomes were the proportion of MRSA among S. aureus isolates (resistance proportion) or among individual samples (prevalence).Published literature on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the Asia-Pacific region was reviewed to document the prevalence of MRSA in the region and to examine the impact of variability in study design on the reported MRSA prevalence data.The resistance proportions and prevalence of MRSA infections in Asia-Pacific are comparable with those reported in other regions with no significant secular changes in the past decade. Country income status and characteristics of the sample population explained more variation in the reported resistance proportions and prevalence of MRSA than methodological differences in AST across locations in the region.","1008":"It is generally assumed that the effects of tumor and personal characteristics on the survival of patients with head and neck cancer are fixed over time, but this study shows that many factors are most important only in the first few years after diagnosis. Also, recent improvements in the survival of patients with head and neck cancer appear to benefit only patients with cancers of the oropharynx. The improvements may be due more to an increasing fraction of cancers caused by human papillomavirus (which generally have better outcomes) than to advances in head and neck cancer treatment overall.Anatomical site is strongly associated with head and neck cancer etiology, and etiology and patient sociodemographic characteristics are prognostic factors for survival. It is not known whether the effects of these predictors persist over the postdiagnosis period or are strongest proximal to the time of diagnosis.All effects were significantly time-varying (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Patients with nonoropharyngeal cancer had a higher hazard of cancer-specific death but a similar cumulative fraction of deaths because of a higher rate of death from other causes. Cancer-specific survival has not changed for patients with nonoropharyngeal cancer over the past decades but has improved since 2000 for patients with oropharyngeal cancer. The effects of age and sex on cancer survival were strongest proximal to the diagnosis, whereas the effect of race persisted over time.Recent improvements in survival for patients with oropharyngeal cancer may be due more to an increasing fraction of cancers attributable to human papillomavirus than to increasing treatment effectiveness. The prognostic strength of anatomical site and other predictors changes over the postdiagnosis period.Using survival times and causes of death for 180,434 patients with head and neck cancer in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry (1973-2015), the empirical cumulative incidences of cancer-specific death and other-cause death were calculated with a competing risks framework, and the time-dependent effects (hazard ratios) of anatomical tumor site (oropharynx, oral cavity, or hypopharynx\/larynx), age, sex, race, and year of diagnosis on cancer-specific death and other-cause death, stratified by tumor stage, were estimated.","1009":"All applicable cases in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Part B Summary Data Files.Increasing payment for the iStent represents the majority of the increase in glaucoma surgical spending in the recent decade.

Glaucoma surgical procedures, including trabeculectomy, glaucoma drainage implants (GDIs), and select minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries (MIGS) including the iStent, were queried from the database using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. We used Chow's test to confirm significant changes in expenditure trajectories. We built a mixed-effects regression model to examine the effect of demographic factors on each state's iStent adoption speed.Retrospective, observational, population-based analysis.Total Medicare part B payment for the selected glaucoma procedures increased from $52.0 million in 2007 to $179.9 million in 2017.

Conversely, the iStent, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2012, increased to represent 57.9% of total payment by 2017. There were significant changes in the slope of glaucoma surgical Medicare payment (P < 0.00001) and iStent payment (P < 0.0001) trajectories in 2012. Mixed-effect regression analysis showed a wide range among the states' rates of increase in iStent proportion between 2012 and 2017 (range, 5.12%-14.54% per year). Higher male proportion in the population was associated with faster increases in iStent proportions (12.4% per 5% increase in male proportion, 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.3-20.5, P\u00a0= 0.003).

A clear definition of \"hard-to-reach\" populations - also known as high-risk or marginalized populations, or reaching the last mile - is essential for estimating the size of target groups, sharing lessons learned based on consistent definitions, and allocating resources appropriately. A literature review was conducted to determine what formal definitions of hard-to-reach populations exist and how they are being used, and to propose definitions to consider for future use. Overall, we found that (1) there is a need to distinguish populations that are hard to reach versus hard to vaccinate, and (2) the existing literature poorly defined these populations and clear criteria or thresholds for classifying them were missing. Based on this review, we propose that hard-to-reach populations be defined as those facing supply-side barriers to vaccination due to geography by distance or terrain, transient or nomadic movement, healthcare provider discrimination, lack of healthcare provider recommendations, inadequate vaccination systems, war and conflict, home births or other home-bound mobility limitations, or legal restrictions. Although multiple mechanisms may apply to the same population, supply-side barriers should be distinguished from demand-side barriers. Hard-to-vaccinate populations are defined as those who are reachable but difficult to vaccinate due to distrust, religious beliefs, lack of awareness of vaccine benefits and recommendations, poverty or low socioeconomic status, lack of time to access available vaccination services, or gender-based discrimination. Further work is needed to better define hard-to-reach populations and delineate them from populations that may be hard to vaccinate due to complex refusal reasons, improve measurement of the size and importance of their impact, and examine interventions related to overcoming barriers for each mechanism. This will enable policy makers, governments, donors, and the vaccine community to better plan interventions and allocate necessary resources to remove existing barriers to vaccination.","1011":"We analyzed 221 COVID-19 cases identified between June 2020 and January 2021 in 6,074 individuals screened for IgG antibodies in May 2020, representing 77% of residents of five Italian municipalities.

Novel vaccines effective in adolescents and adults could reduce this burden. M72\/AS01E and BCG-revaccination have recently completed Phase IIb trials and estimates of their population-level impact are needed. We estimated the potential health and economic impact of M72\/AS01E and BCG-revaccination in India and investigated the impact of variation in vaccine characteristics and delivery strategies. Methods We developed an age-stratified compartmental tuberculosis transmission model for India calibrated to country-specific epidemiology. We projected baseline epidemiology to 2050 assuming no-new-vaccine introduction, and M72\/AS01E and BCG-revaccination scenarios over 2025-2050 exploring uncertainty in product characteristics (vaccine efficacy, mechanism of effect, infection status required for vaccine efficacy, duration of protection) and implementation (achieved vaccine coverage and ages targeted). We estimated reductions in tuberculosis cases and deaths by each scenario compared to no-new-vaccine introduction, as well as costs and cost-effectiveness from health-system and societal perspectives. Results M72\/AS01E scenarios were predicted to avert 40% more tuberculosis cases and deaths by 2050 compared to BCG-revaccination scenarios. Cost-effectiveness ratios for M72\/AS01E vaccines were around seven times higher than BCG-revaccination, but nearly all scenarios were cost-effective. The estimated average incremental cost was US$190 million for M72\/AS01E and US$23 million for BCG-revaccination per year. Sources of uncertainty included whether M72\/AS01E was efficacious in uninfected individuals at vaccination, and if BCG-revaccination could prevent disease. Conclusions M72\/AS01E and BCG-revaccination could be impactful and cost-effective in India. However, there is great uncertainty in impact, especially given unknowns surrounding mechanism of effect and infection status required for vaccine efficacy. Greater investment in vaccine development and delivery is needed to resolve these unknowns in vaccine product characteristics.","1014":"SignificanceThe age of reported dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases, the severe form of dengue infections, has been increasing in Thailand for four decades. Factors underlying this shift remain poorly understood, challenging public health planning. Here, we found aging of the population and its effect on the hazard of transmission to be the dominant contributors, with temporal changes in surveillance practices playing a lesser role. With ongoing population aging, we expect a continuing shift of DHF toward older individuals, heightening the chance of clinical complications with comorbidities. With most other highly endemic countries facing similar shifts in age structure, the pattern is expected to appear elsewhere. Awareness is needed to improve diagnosis and treatment.","1015":"Societal biosecurity, measures built into everyday society to minimize risks from pests and diseases, is an important aspect of managing epidemics and pandemics. We aimed to identify societal options for reducing the transmission and spread of respiratory viruses. We used SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) as a case study to meet the immediate need to manage the COVID-19 pandemic and eventually transition to more normal societal conditions, and to catalog options for managing similar pandemics in the future. We used a 'solution scanning' approach. We read the literature; consulted psychology, public health, medical, and solution scanning experts; crowd-sourced options using social media; and collated comments on a preprint. Here, we present a list of 517 possible measures to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission and spread. We provide a long list of options for policymakers and businesses to consider when designing biosecurity plans to combat SARS-CoV-2 and similar pathogens in the future. We also developed an online application to help with this process. We encourage testing of actions, documentation of outcomes, revisions to the current list, and the addition of further options.","1016":"Genetic drift in infectious disease transmission results from randomness of transmission and host recovery or death. The strength of genetic drift for SARS-CoV-2 transmission is expected to be high due to high levels of superspreading, and this is expected to substantially impact disease epidemiology and evolution. However, we don't yet have an understanding of how genetic drift changes over time or across locations. Furthermore, noise that results from data collection can potentially confound estimates of genetic drift. To address this challenge, we develop and validate a method to jointly infer genetic drift and measurement noise from time-series lineage frequency data. Our method is highly scalable to increasingly large genomic datasets, which overcomes a limitation in commonly used phylogenetic methods. We apply this method to over 490,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences from England collected between March 2020 and December 2021 by the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium and separately infer the strength of genetic drift for pre-B.1.177, B.1.177, Alpha, and Delta. We find that even after correcting for measurement noise, the strength of genetic drift is consistently, throughout time, higher than that expected from the observed number of COVID-19 positive individuals in England by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude, which cannot be explained by literature values of superspreading. Our estimates of genetic drift suggest low and time-varying establishment probabilities for new mutations, inform the parametrization of SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary models, and motivate future studies of the potential mechanisms for increased stochasticity in this system.","1017":"Contact tracing forms a crucial part of the public-health toolbox in mitigating and understanding emergent pathogens and nascent disease outbreaks. Contact tracing in the United States was conducted during the pre-Omicron phase of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This tracing relied on voluntary reporting and responses, often using rapid antigen tests due to lack of accessibility to PCR tests. These limitations, combined with SARS-CoV-2's propensity for asymptomatic transmission, raise the question \"how reliable was contact tracing for COVID-19 in the United States\"? We answered this question using a Markov model to examine the efficiency with which transmission could be detected based on the design and response rates of contact tracing studies in the United States. Our results suggest that contact tracing protocols in the U.S. are unlikely to have identified more than 1.65% (95% uncertainty interval: 1.62-1.68%) of transmission events with PCR testing and 1.00% (95% uncertainty interval 0.98-1.02%) with rapid antigen testing. When considering a more robust contact tracing scenario, based on compliance rates in East Asia with PCR testing, this increases to 62.7% (95% uncertainty interval: 62.6-62.8%). We did not assume presence of asymptomatic transmission or superspreading, making our estimates upper bounds on the actual percentages traced. These findings highlight the limitations in interpretability for studies of SARS-CoV-2 disease spread based on U.S. contact tracing and underscore the vulnerability of the population to future disease outbreaks, for SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens.","1018":"Temperature is widely known to influence the spatio-temporal dynamics of vector-borne disease transmission, particularly as temperatures vary across critical thermal thresholds. When temperature conditions exhibit such \u2018transcritical variation\u2019, abrupt spatial or temporal discontinuities may result, generating sharp geographical or seasonal boundaries in transmission. Here, we develop a spatio-temporal machine learning algorithm to examine the implications of transcritical variation for West Nile virus (WNV) transmission in the Los Angeles metropolitan area (LA). Analysing a large vector and WNV surveillance dataset spanning 2006\u20132016, we found that mean temperatures in the previous month strongly predicted the probability of WNV presence in pools of Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, forming distinctive inhibitory (10.0\u201321.0\u00b0C) and favourable (22.7\u201330.2\u00b0C) mean temperature ranges that bound a narrow 1.7\u00b0C transitional zone (21\u201322.7\u00b0C). Temperatures during the most intense months of WNV transmission (August\/September) were more strongly associated with infection probability in Cx. quinquefasciatus pools in coastal LA, where temperature variation more frequently traversed the narrow transitional temperature range compared to warmer inland locations. This contributed to a pronounced expansion in the geographical distribution of human cases near the coast during warmer-than-average periods. Our findings suggest that transcritical variation may influence the sensitivity of transmission to climate warming, and that especially vulnerable locations may occur where present climatic fluctuations traverse critical temperature thresholds.","1019":"As the world grapples with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a particularly thorny set of questions surrounds the reopening of primary and secondary (K-12) schools. The benefits of in-person learning are numerous, in terms of education quality, mental health, emotional well-being, equity and access to food and shelter. Early reports suggested that children might have reduced susceptibility to COVID-19, and children have been shown to experience fewer complications than older adults. Over the past few months, our understanding of COVID-19 has been further shaped by emerging data, and it is now understood that children are as susceptible to infection as adults and have a similar viral load during infection, even if asymptomatic. Based on this updated understanding of the disease, we have used epidemiological modeling to explore the feasibility and consequences of school reopening in the face of differing rates of COVID-19 prevalence and transmission. We focused our analysis on the United States, but the results are applicable to other countries as well. We demonstrate the potential for a large discrepancy between detected cases and true infections in schools due to the combination of high asymptomatic rates in children coupled with delays in seeking testing and receiving results from diagnostic tests. Our findings indicate that, regardless of the initial prevalence of the disease, and in the absence of robust surveillance testing and contact-tracing, most schools in the United States can expect to remain open for 20-60 days without the emergence of sizeable disease clusters. At this point, even if schools choose to close after outbreaks occur, COVID-19 cases will be seeded from these school clusters and amplified into the community. Thus, our findings suggest that the debate between the risks to student safety and benefits of in-person learning frames a false dual choice. Reopening schools without surveillance testing and contact tracing measures in place will lead to spread within the schools and within the communities that eventually forces a return to remote learning and leaves a trail of infection in its wake.","1020":" virus reduction) resulted in a maximum risk of 0.02 per consumption event across all commodities.

Following the limited effects of a routine pyrethroid insecticide spraying campaign conducted over 2011-2013 (first period) in Avia Terai, an endemic municipality with approximately 2300 houses, we implemented a rapid-impact intervention package to suppress house infestation across the urban-to-rural gradient over 2015-2019 (second period). Here, we assess their impacts and whether persisting infestations were associated with pyrethroid resistance.The 2011-2013 campaign achieved a limited detection and spray coverage across settings (<\u200968%), more so during the surveillance phase. Following community mobilization and school-based interventions, the 2015-2019 program assessed baseline house infestation using a stratified sampling strategy; sprayed all rural houses with suspension concentrate beta-cypermethrin, and selectively sprayed infested and adjacent houses in urban and peri-urban settings; and monitored house infestation and performed selective treatments over the follow-up.The intervention package was substantially more effective than the routine insecticide spraying campaign, though the effects were lower than predicted due to unexpected incipient or moderate pyrethroid resistance. Increased awareness and diagnosis of vector control failures in the Gran Chaco, including appropriate remedial actions, are greatly needed.Over the first period, house infestation returned to pre-intervention levels within 3-4\u00a0years. The adjusted relative odds of house infestation between 2011-2013 and 2015-2016 differed very little (adj. OR: 1.17, 95% CI 0.91-1.51). Over the second period, infestation decreased significantly between 0 and 1\u00a0year post-spraying (YPS) (adj. OR: 0.36, 95% CI 0.28-0.46), with heterogeneous effects across the gradient. Mean bug abundance also dropped between 0 and 1 YPS and thereafter remained stable in rural and peri-urban areas. Using multiple regression models, house infestation and bug abundance at 1 YPS were 3-4 times higher if the house had been infested before treatment, or was scored as high-risk or non-participating. No low-risk house was ever infested. Persistent foci over two successive surveys increased from 30.0 to 59.3% across the gradient. Infestation was more concentrated in peridomestic rather than domestic habitats. Discriminating-dose bioassays showed incipient or moderate pyrethroid resistance in 7% of 28 triatomine populations collected over 2015-2016 and in 83% of 52 post-spraying populations.","1022":"Logic regression is a useful tool for identifying important characteristics of extreme heat exposures for adverse health outcomes, which may help improve future heat warning systems and response plans.Short-term associations between extreme heat events and adverse health outcomes are well-established in epidemiologic studies. However, the use of different exposure definitions across studies has limited our understanding of extreme heat characteristics that are most important for specific health outcomes or subpopulations.Logic regression is a statistical learning method for constructing decision trees based on Boolean combinations of binary predictors. We describe how logic regression can be utilized as a data-driven approach to identify extreme heat exposure definitions using health outcome data. We evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm in a simulation study, as well as in a 20-year time-series analysis of extreme heat and emergency department visits for 12 outcomes in the Atlanta metropolitan area.For the Atlanta case study, our novel application of logic regression identified extreme heat exposure definitions that were associated with several heat-sensitive disease outcomes (e.g., fluid and electrolyte imbalance, renal diseases, ischemic stroke, and hypertension). Exposures were often characterized by extreme apparent minimum temperature or maximum temperature over multiple days. The simulation study also demonstrated that logic regression can successfully identify exposures of different lags and duration structures when statistical power is sufficient.","1023":"The evolutionary mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 viruses adapt to mammalian hosts and, potentially, undergo antigenic evolution depend on the ways genetic variation is generated and selected within and between individual hosts. Using domestic cats as a model, we show that SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences remain largely unchanged over time within hosts, while dynamic sub-consensus diversity reveals processes of genetic drift and weak purifying selection. We further identify a notable variant at amino acid position 655 in Spike (H655Y), which was previously shown to confer escape from human monoclonal antibodies. This variant arises rapidly and persists at intermediate frequencies in index cats. It also becomes fixed following transmission in two of three pairs. These dynamics suggest this site may be under positive selection in this system and illustrate how a variant can quickly arise and become fixed in parallel across multiple transmission pairs. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in cats involved a narrow bottleneck, with new infections founded by fewer than ten viruses. In RNA virus evolution, stochastic processes like narrow transmission bottlenecks and genetic drift typically act to constrain the overall pace of adaptive evolution. Our data suggest that here, positive selection in index cats followed by a narrow transmission bottleneck may have instead accelerated the fixation of S H655Y, a potentially beneficial SARS-CoV-2 variant. Overall, our study suggests species- and context-specific adaptations are likely to continue to emerge. This underscores the importance of continued genomic surveillance for new SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as heightened scrutiny for signatures of SARS-CoV-2 positive selection in humans and mammalian model systems.","1024":"II-1 global pandemic strains.","1025":"New cancer treatment modalities that limit patient discomfort need to be developed. One possible new therapy is the use of oncolytic (cancer-killing) viruses. It is only recently that our ability to manipulate viral genomes has allowed us to consider deliberately infecting cancer patients with viruses. One key consideration is to ensure that the virus exclusively targets cancer cells and does not harm nearby non-cancerous cells. Here, we use a mathematical model of viral infection to determine the characteristics a virus would need to have in order to eradicate a tumor, but leave non-cancerous cells untouched. We conclude that the virus must differ in its ability to infect the two different cell types, with the infection rate of non-cancerous cells needing to be less than one hundredth of the infection rate of cancer cells. Differences in viral production rate or infectious cell death rate alone are not sufficient to protect non-cancerous cells.","1026":" We investigate these time trends in an extremely large international cohort of 142,540 patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Investigated are: time from symptom onset to hospital admission, probability of ICU\/HDU admission, time from hospital admission to ICU\/HDU admission, hospital case fatality ratio (hCFR) and total length of hospital stay. This work was supported by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and Wellcome [215091\/Z\/18\/Z] and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1209135]. The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. Our results establish that variables of these kinds have limitations when used as outcome measures in a rapidly-evolving situation. There is potentially considerable variation in the nature and duration of the care provided to hospitalised patients during an infectious disease epidemic or pandemic. Improvements in care and clinician confidence may shorten the time spent as an inpatient, or the need for admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) or high density unit (HDU). On the other hand, limited resources at times of high demand may lead to rationing. Nevertheless, these variables may be used as static proxies for disease severity, as outcome measures for trials, and to inform planning and logistics. Time from onset to admission showed a rapid decline during the first months of the pandemic followed by peaks during August\/September and December 2020. ICU\/HDU admission was more frequent from June to August. The hCFR was lowest from June to August. Raw numbers for overall hospital stay showed little variation, but there is clear decline in time to discharge for ICU\/HDU survivors.","1027":"A cross-sectional census with an embedded questionnaire to capture social relationships was conducted among eleven peri-urban communities. Community connectedness was related to study outcomes of food security and per-capita income through regression models.Of 1520 households identified, 1383 were interviewed (91.0%) and 1272 (83.9%) provided complete data. Households in the youngest communities had the most total contacts, and the highest proportion of contacts outside of the community. Household income was also associated with more outside-community contacts (0.05 more contacts per standard deviation increase in income, p<0.001).Less food secure households reported more contacts nearby (0.24 increase in household food insecurity access scale (HFIAS) for each additional contact, p<0.001). After adjusting for household-level socioeconomic status, membership in an older, larger, and better-connected community, with a greater proportion of residents engaged in rural livelihood strategies, was associated with greater food security (-0.92 decrease in HFIAS for each one-unit increase in community mean degree, p=0.008). There was no evidence that social connectedness modified the relationship between income and food security such that lower-income households benefited more from community membership than higher-income households.Although households reported networks that spanned rural villages and urban centers, contacts within the community, with whom food was regularly shared, were most important to maintaining food security. Interventions that build within-community connectedness in peri-urban settings may increase food security.We investigated relationships between household- and community-level social connectedness, household food security, and household income; and tested the hypothesis that social connectedness modified the relationship between income and food security.Food insecurity is a major global public health issue. Social capital has been identified as central to maintaining food security across a wide range of low- and middle-income country contexts, but few studies have examined this relationship through sociocentric network analysis.","1028":"For both countries, we calibrated a tuberculosis model to a scenario without self-clearance and to various scenarios with self-clearance. To account for the current uncertainty in self-clearance properties, we varied the rate of self-clearance, and the level of protection against reinfection in self-cleared individuals. We introduced potential new vaccines in 2025, exploring vaccines that work in uninfected or infected individuals only, or that are effective regardless of infection status, and modelling scenarios with different levels of vaccine efficacy in self-cleared individuals. We then estimated the relative disease incidence reduction in 2050 for each vaccine compared with the no vaccination scenario.The inclusion of self-clearance increased the estimated relative reductions in incidence in 2050 for vaccines effective only in uninfected individuals, by a maximum of 12% in China and 8% in India. The inclusion of self-clearance increased the estimated impact of vaccines only effective in infected individuals in some scenarios and decreased it in others, by a maximum of 14% in China and 15% in India. As would be expected, the inclusion of self-clearance had minimal impact on estimated reductions in incidence for vaccines that work regardless of infection status.Our work suggests that the neglect of self-clearance in mathematical models of tuberculosis vaccines does not result in substantially biased estimates of tuberculosis vaccine impact. It may, however, mean that we are slightly underestimating the relative advantages of vaccines that work in uninfected individuals only compared with those that work in infected individuals.Mathematical modelling has been used extensively to estimate the potential impact of new tuberculosis vaccines, with the majority of existing models assuming that individuals with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection remain at lifelong risk of tuberculosis disease. Recent research provides evidence that self-clearance of Mtb infection may be common, which may affect the potential impact of new vaccines that only take in infected or uninfected individuals. We explored how the inclusion of self-clearance in models of tuberculosis affects the estimates of vaccine impact in China and India.","1029":"The coronavirus pandemic and in-person contact restrictions necessitated rapid implementation of telehealth, specifically videoconferencing, to provide essential care to patients. This study surveyed 25 pediatric behavioral health providers at a single center during their first month of utilizing telehealth during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Twenty-one participants completed a pre-questionnaire distributed prior to telehealth service delivery, and 23 providers completed a post-questionnaire approximately three weeks later. Results indicate the majority of behavioral health providers had no experience providing telehealth services prior to COVID-19. The majority of participating behavioral health providers utilized telehealth to provide pediatric patient care within the first month of access to telehealth. Participants' confidence in their ability to provide telehealth services significantly increased within the first month of implementation, regardless of previous training in telehealth. This study identified differences between anticipated and actual barriers to treatment, with technological issues identified as the largest actual barrier to service delivery. Participants indicated a preference for in-person service delivery, which they reported allows for better rapport-building, behavioral observations, reduced technological barriers, and fewer distractions. However, most participants reported they intend to continue utilizing telehealth for certain types of behavioral health services (e.g., diagnostic interviews and outpatient therapy) after the pandemic has subsided.","1030":"We conducted an integrative analysis to elucidate the spatial epidemiological patterns of the Vesicular Stomatitis New Jersey virus (VSNJV) during the 2014-15 epizootic cycle in the United States (US). Using georeferenced VSNJV genomics data, confirmed vesicular stomatitis (VS) disease cases from surveillance, and a suite of environmental factors, our study assessed environmental and phylogenetic similarity to compare VS cases reported in 2014 and 2015. Despite uncertainties from incomplete virus sampling and cross-scale spatial processes, patterns suggested multiple independent re-invasion events concurrent with potential viral overwintering between sequential seasons. Our findings pointed to a geographically defined southern virus pool at the US-Mexico interface as the source of VSNJV invasions and overwintering sites. Phylodynamic analysis demonstrated an increase in virus diversity before a rise in case numbers and a pronounced reduction in virus diversity during the winter season, indicative of a genetic bottleneck and a significant narrowing of virus variation between the summer outbreak seasons. Environment-vector interactions underscored the central role of meta-population dynamics in driving disease spread. These insights emphasize the necessity for location- and time-specific management practices, including rapid response, movement restrictions, vector control, and other targeted interventions.","1031":"The role of perceived experts (i.e., medical professionals and biomedical scientists) as potential anti-vaccine influencers has not been characterized systematically. We describe the prevalence and importance of anti-vaccine perceived experts by constructing a coengagement network based on a Twitter data set containing over 4.2 million posts from April 2021. The coengagement network primarily broke into two large communities that differed in their stance toward COVID-19 vaccines, and misinformation was predominantly shared by the anti-vaccine community. Perceived experts had a sizable presence within the anti-vaccine community and shared academic sources at higher rates compared to others in that community. Perceived experts occupied important network positions as central anti-vaccine nodes and bridges between the anti- and pro-vaccine communities. Perceived experts received significantly more engagements than other individuals within the anti- and pro-vaccine communities and there was no significant difference in the influence boost for perceived experts between the two communities. Interventions designed to reduce the impact of perceived experts who spread anti-vaccine misinformation may be warranted.","1032":"Estimating the number of host species that a parasite can infect (i.e. host range) provides key insights into the evolution of host specialism and is a central concept in disease ecology. Host range is rarely estimated in real systems, however, because variation in species relative abundance and the detection of rare species makes it challenging to confidently estimate host range. We applied a non-parametric richness indicator to estimate host range in simulated and empirical data, allowing us to assess the influence of sampling heterogeneity and data completeness. After validating our method on simulated data, we estimated parasite host range for a sparsely sampled global parasite occurrence database (Global Mammal Parasite Database) and a repeatedly sampled set of parasites of small mammals from New Mexico (Sevilleta Long Term Ecological Research Program). Estimation accuracy varied strongly with parasite taxonomy, number of parasite occurrence records, and the shape of host species-abundance distribution (i.e. the dominance and rareness of species in the host community). Our findings suggest that between 20% and 40% of parasite host ranges are currently unknown, highlighting a major gap in our understanding of parasite specificity, host-parasite network structure, and parasite burdens.","1033":"Rats received unilateral stereotaxic injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the medial forebrain bundle on day 0: The contralateral side served as control. Safinamide or vehicle was delivered from days 0 or 1, for 7 days, via sub-cutaneous mini-pumps.Safinamide therapy suppresses microglial activation and protects dopaminergic neurons from degeneration in the 6-hydroxydopamine model of PD, suggesting that the drug not only treats symptoms but also provides neuroprotection.Current therapies in Parkinson's disease mainly treat symptoms rather than provide effective neuroprotection. We examined the effects of safinamide (monoamine oxidase B and sodium channel blocker) on microglial activation and the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in a rat model of PD\u2005in vivo, and on microglia in vitro.In vehicle-treated rats 6-hydroxydopamine caused a significant increase in the number of activated MHC-II(+) microglia compared with the contralateral side, and only 50% of the dopaminergic neurons survived in the ipsilateral SNc. In contrast, rats treated daily with safinamide 50 and 150\u2009mg\/ml (on day 0 or 1) exhibited a significantly reduced number of activated microglia (55% reduction at 150\u2009mg\/ml) and a significant protection of dopaminergic neurons (80% of neurons survived) (P\u2009<\u20090.001) compared with vehicle-treated controls. Rasagiline, a monoamine oxidase B inhibitor, and lamotrigine, a sodium channel blocking drug, also protected dopaminergic neurons, indicating that safinamide may act by either or both mechanisms. Safinamide also reduced the activation of microglial cells in response to lipopolysaccharide exposure in vitro.","1034":"Homeless persons have elevated risk of tuberculosis (TB) and are under-served by conventional health services. Approaches to active case-finding (ACF) and treatment tailored to their needs are required. A transmission-dynamic model was developed to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of screening with mobile Chest X-ray, GeneXpert, or both. Effectiveness of ACF depends upon the prevalence of infection in the population (which determines screening 'yield'), patient willingness to wait for GeneXpert results, and treatment adherence. ACF is efficient when TB prevalence exceeds 78\/100,000 and 46% of drug sensitive TB cases and 33% of multi-drug resistant TB cases complete treatment. This threshold increases to 92\/100,000 if additional post-ACF enhanced case management (ECM) increases treatment completion to 85%. Generally, the most efficient option is one-step screening of all patients with GeneXpert, but if too many patients (>27% without ECM, >19% with ECM) are unwilling to wait the 90\u2009minutes required then two-step screening using chest X-ray (which is rapid) followed by GeneXpert for confirmation of TB is the most efficient option. Targeted ACF and support services benefit health through early successful treatment and averting TB transmission and disease. The optimal strategy is setting-specific, requiring careful consideration of patients' needs regarding testing and treatment.","1035":"Online social networks are the perfect test bed to better understand large-scale human behavior in interacting contexts. Although they are broadly used and studied, little is known about how their terms of service and posting rules affect the way users interact and information spreads. Acknowledging the relation between network connectivity and functionality, we compare the robustness of two different online social platforms, Twitter and Gab, with respect to banning, or dismantling, strategies based on the recursive censor of users characterized by social prominence (degree) or intensity of inflammatory content (sentiment). We find that the moderated (Twitter) vs. unmoderated (Gab) character of the network is not a discriminating factor for intervention effectiveness. We find, however, that more complex strategies based upon the combination of topological and content features may be effective for network dismantling. Our results provide useful indications to design better strategies for countervailing the production and dissemination of anti-social content in online social platforms.","1036":"When predators consume prey, they risk becoming infected with their prey's parasites, which can then establish the predator as a secondary host. A predator population's diet therefore influences what parasites it is exposed to, as has been repeatedly shown in many species such as threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) (more benthic-feeding individuals obtain nematodes from oligocheate prey, whereas limnetic-feeding individuals catch cestodes from copepod prey). These differing parasite encounters, in turn, determine how natural selection acts on the predator's immune system. We might therefore expect that eco-evolutionary dynamics of a predator's diet (as determined by its ecomorphology) should drive correlated evolution of its immune traits. Conversely, the predator's immunity to certain parasites might alter the relative costs and benefits of different prey, driving evolution of its ecomorphology. To evaluate the potential for ecological morphology to drive evolution of immunity, and vice versa, we use a quantitative genetics framework coupled with an ecological model of a predator and two prey species (the diet options). Our analysis reveals fundamental asymmetries in the evolution of ecomorphology and immunity. When ecomorphology rapidly evolves, it determines how immunity evolves, but not vice versa. Weak tradeoffs in ecological morphology select for diet generalists despite strong immunological trade offs, but not vice versa. Only weak immunological trade-offs can explain negative diet-infection correlations across populations. The analysis also reveals that eco-evo-immuno feedbacks destabilize population dynamics when trade-offs are sufficiently weak and heritability is sufficiently high. Collectively, these results highlight the delicate interplay between multivariate trait evolution and the dynamics of ecological\u00a0communities. This article is protected by copyright.

NGS technologies can provide holistic insight into microbial communities and their functional capacities in water and wastewater systems, thus eliminating the need to develop a new assay for each target organism or gene. However, several barriers have hampered wide-scale adoption of NGS by the water industry, including cost, need for specialized expertise and equipment, challenges with data analysis and interpretation, lack of standardized methods, and the rapid pace of development of new technologies. In this critical review, we provide an overview of the current state of the science of NGS technologies as they apply to water, wastewater, and recycled water. In addition, a systematic literature review was conducted in which we identified over 600 peer-reviewed journal articles on this topic and summarized their contributions to six key areas relevant to the water and wastewater fields: taxonomic classification and pathogen detection, functional and catabolic gene characterization, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiling, bacterial toxicity characterization, Cyanobacteria and harmful algal bloom identification, and virus characterization. For each application, we have presented key trends, noteworthy advancements, and proposed future directions. Finally, key needs to advance NGS technologies for broader application in water and wastewater fields are assessed.","1038":"Background.\u2003Plasmodium knowlesi causes severe malaria, but its pathogenesis is poorly understood.

Nonspecific retinal whitening occurred in 3 (35%) and 5 (29%) patients with severe and nonsevere disease, respectively; hemorrhages in 2 (17%) and 3 (18%); loss of retinal pigment epithelium in 1 (8%) and 4 (24%); and drusen in 9 (71%) and 12 (75%).

In particular, experimental evidence suggests that influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) compete with each other, such that infection with one confers temporary protection against the other. However, such interactions are challenging to study using common epidemiologic methods. Here, we use a mathematical modeling approach, in conjunction with detailed surveillance data from Hong Kong and Canada, to infer the strength and duration of the interaction between influenza and RSV. Based on our estimates, we further utilize our model to evaluate the potential conflicting effects of live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) on RSV burden. We find evidence of a moderate to strong, negative, bidirectional interaction, such that infection with either virus yields 40-100% protection against infection with the other for one to five months. Assuming that LAIV reduces RSV susceptibility in a similar manner, we predict that the impact of such a vaccine at the population level would likely depend greatly on underlying viral circulation patterns. More broadly, we highlight the utility of mathematical models as a tool to characterize pathogen-pathogen interactions.","1040":" imaging, biochemical characterization, and behavioral assessments.

Reliable and effective analytical methods are necessary to obtain the required solutions, as it is very difficult to obtain accurate solutions for certain fuzzy differential equations. In this paper, certain fuzzy approximate solutions are constructed and analyzed by means of a residual power series (RPS) technique involving some class of fuzzy fractional differential equations. The considered methodology for finding the fuzzy solutions relies on converting the target equations into two fractional crisp systems in terms of \u03c1-cut representations. The residual power series therefore gives solutions for the converted systems by combining fractional residual functions and fractional Taylor expansions to obtain values of the coefficients of the fractional power series. To validate the efficiency and the applicability of our proposed approach we derive solutions of the fuzzy fractional initial value problem by testing two attractive applications. The compatibility of the behavior of the solutions is determined via some graphical and numerical analysis of the proposed results. Moreover, the comparative results point out that the proposed method is more accurate compared to the other existing methods. Finally, the results attained in this article emphasize that the residual power series technique is easy, efficient, and fast for predicting solutions of the uncertain models arising in real physical phenomena.","1042":"We performed whole-genome sequencing of 174 Salmonella Typhi and 54 Salmonella Paratyphi A isolates collected through prospective surveillance in the context of a phased typhoid conjugate vaccine introduction in Navi Mumbai, India. We investigate the temporal and geographical patterns of emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance. We evaluated the relationship between the spatial distance between households and genetic clustering of isolates. Most isolates were non-susceptible to fluoroquinolones, with nearly 20% containing \u22653 quinolone resistance-determining region mutations. Two H58 isolates carried an IncX3 plasmid containing blaSHV-12, associated with ceftriaxone resistance, suggesting that the ceftriaxone-resistant isolates from India independently evolved on multiple occasions. Among S. Typhi, we identified two main clades circulating (2.2 and 4.3.1 [H58]); 2.2 isolates were closely related following a single introduction around 2007, whereas H58 isolates had been introduced multiple times to the city. Increasing geographic distance between isolates was strongly associated with genetic clustering (odds ratio [OR] = 0.72 per km; 95% credible interval [CrI]: 0.66-0.79). This effect was seen for distances up to 5 km (OR = 0.65 per km; 95% CrI: 0.59-0.73) but not seen for distances beyond 5 km (OR = 1.02 per km; 95% CrI: 0.83-1.26). There was a non-significant reduction in odds of clustering for pairs of isolates in vaccination communities compared with non-vaccination communities or mixed pairs compared with non-vaccination communities. Our findings indicate that S. Typhi was repeatedly introduced into Navi Mumbai and then spread locally, with strong evidence of spatial genetic clustering. In addition to vaccination, local interventions to improve water and sanitation will be critical to interrupt transmission. IMPORTANCE Enteric fever remains a major public health concern in many low- and middle-income countries, as antimicrobial resistance (AMR) continues to emerge. Geographical patterns of typhoidal Salmonella spread, critical to monitoring AMR and planning interventions, are poorly understood. We performed whole-genome sequencing of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A isolates collected in Navi Mumbai, India before and after a typhoid conjugate vaccine introduction. From timed phylogenies, we found two dominant circulating lineages of S. Typhi in Navi Mumbai-lineage 2.2, which expanded following a single introduction a decade prior, and 4.3.1 (H58), which had been introduced repeatedly from other parts of India, frequently containing \"triple mutations\" conferring high-level ciprofloxacin resistance. Using Bayesian hierarchical statistical models, we found that spatial distance between cases was strongly associated with genetic clustering at a fine scale (<5 km). Together, these findings suggest that antimicrobial-resistant S. Typhi frequently flows between cities and then spreads highly locally, which may inform surveillance and prevention strategies.","1043":"As COVID-19 spreads worldwide, an infodemic - i.e., an over-abundance of information, reliable or not - spreads across the physical and the digital worlds, triggering behavioral responses which cause public health concern.We study 200 million interactions captured from Twitter during the early stage of the pandemic, from January to April 2020, to understand its socio-informational structure on a global scale.Contradicting the idea that digital social media favor active participation and co-creation of online content, our results imply that public health policy strategies to counter the effects of the infodemic must not only focus on information content, but also on the social articulation of its diffusion mechanisms, as a given community tends to be relatively impermeable to news generated by non-aligned sources.The COVID-19 global communication network is characterized by knowledge groups, hierarchically organized in sub-groups with well-defined geo-political and ideological characteristics. Communication is mostly segregated within groups and driven by a small number of subjects: 0.1% of users account for up to 45% and 10% of activities and news shared, respectively, centralizing the information flow.","1044":" substitution\/site\/year.

The greatest impact on HIV was estimated to be from interruption to antiretroviral therapy, which could occur during a period of high health system demand. For tuberculosis, the greatest impact would be from reductions in timely diagnosis and treatment of new cases, which could result from any prolonged period of COVID-19 suppression interventions. The greatest impact on malaria burden could be as a result of interruption of planned net campaigns. These disruptions could lead to a loss of life-years over 5 years that is of the same order of magnitude as the direct impact from COVID-19 in places with a high burden of malaria and large HIV and tuberculosis epidemics.Assuming a basic reproduction number of 3\u00b70, we constructed four scenarios for possible responses to the COVID-19 pandemic: no action, mitigation for 6 months, suppression for 2 months, or suppression for 1 year. We used established transmission models of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria to estimate the additional impact on health that could be caused in selected settings, either due to COVID-19 interventions limiting activities, or due to the high demand on the health system due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Maintaining the most critical prevention activities and health-care services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria could substantially reduce the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.COVID-19 has the potential to cause substantial disruptions to health services, due to cases overburdening the health system or response measures limiting usual programmatic activities. We aimed to quantify the extent to which disruptions to services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria in low-income and middle-income countries with high burdens of these diseases could lead to additional loss of life over the next 5 years.Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust, UK Department for International Development, and Medical Research Council.","1046":"Despite the availability of effective vaccines, the persistence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suggests that cocirculation with other pathogens and resulting multiepidemics (of, for example, COVID-19 and influenza) may become increasingly frequent. To better forecast and control the risk of such multiepidemics, it is essential to elucidate the potential interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with other pathogens; these interactions, however, remain poorly defined. Here, we aimed to review the current body of evidence about SARS-CoV-2 interactions. Our review is structured in four parts. To study pathogen interactions in a systematic and comprehensive way, we first developed a general framework to capture their major components: sign (either negative for antagonistic interactions or positive for synergistic interactions), strength (i.e., magnitude of the interaction), symmetry (describing whether the interaction depends on the order of infection of interacting pathogens), duration (describing whether the interaction is short-lived or long-lived), and mechanism (e.g., whether interaction modifies susceptibility to infection, transmissibility of infection, or severity of disease). Second, we reviewed the experimental evidence from animal models about SARS-CoV-2 interactions. Of the 14 studies identified, 11 focused on the outcomes of coinfection with nonattenuated influenza A viruses (IAVs), and 3 with other pathogens. The 11 studies on IAV used different designs and animal models (ferrets, hamsters, and mice) but generally demonstrated that coinfection increased disease severity compared with either monoinfection. By contrast, the effect of coinfection on the viral load of either virus was variable and inconsistent across studies. Third, we reviewed the epidemiological evidence about SARS-CoV-2 interactions in human populations. Although numerous studies were identified, only a few were specifically designed to infer interaction, and many were prone to multiple biases, including confounding. Nevertheless, their results suggested that influenza and pneumococcal conjugate vaccinations were associated with a reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, fourth, we formulated simple transmission models of SARS-CoV-2 cocirculation with an epidemic viral pathogen or an endemic bacterial pathogen, showing how they can naturally incorporate the proposed framework. More generally, we argue that such models, when designed with an integrative and multidisciplinary perspective, will be invaluable tools to resolve the substantial uncertainties that remain about SARS-CoV-2 interactions.","1047":"Institution-based analytical cross-sectional study.Institution-based analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in Ambo town from 15 July 2021 to 15 August 2021. A simple random sampling technique was used to select 420 participants. Data were collected by using structured self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics was used to show the magnitude of WRS. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify variables that are significantly associated with WRS at 95%\u2009CI and p value <0.05.To assess work-related stress (WRS) and associated factors among health professionals working in Ambo town governmental health facilities, in 2021.This study found that the overall prevalence of WRS was 52.33% (47.5, 57.2).

Sex, job insecurity, home-work interface and occurrence of major life events were factors that positively related to WRS and make the work of health professionals stressful. Health facilities, programme managers and policy makers should consider those identified factors while designing public health interventions to reduce WRS among health professionals.A total of 407 participants were involved in the study making the response rate 96.9%. The age of the respondents ranged from 20 to 52 with the mean age of 29 years (SD=4.8).

Evidence-based fall prevention programs are delivered nationwide, largely supported by funding from the Administration for Community Living (ACL), to mitigate fall-related risk. This study utilizes data from 39 ACL grantees in 22 states from 2014 to 2017. The large amount of missing values for falls efficacy in this national database may lead to potentially biased statistical results and make it challenging to implement reliable variable selection. Multiple imputation is used to deal with missing values. To obtain a consistent result of variable selection in multiply-imputed datasets, multiple imputation-stepwise regression (MI-stepwise) and multiple imputation-least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (MI-LASSO) methods are used. To compare the performances of MI-stepwise and MI-LASSO, simulation studies were conducted. In particular, we extended prior work by considering several circumstances not covered in previous studies, including an extensive investigation of data with different signal-to-noise ratios and various missing data patterns across predictors, as well as a data structure that allowed the missingness mechanism to be missing not at random (MNAR). In addition, we evaluated the performance of MI-LASSO method with varying tuning parameters to address the overselection issue in cross-validation (CV)-based LASSO.","1049":"Limited information on costs and the cost-effectiveness of hospital interventions to reduce antibiotic resistance (ABR) hinder efficient resource allocation.Among 20\u2009958 articles, 59 (32 pharmaceutical and 27 non-pharmaceutical interventions) met the inclusion criteria. Non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as hygiene measures, had unit costs as low as $1 per patient, contrasting with generally higher pharmaceutical intervention costs. Several studies found that linezolid-based treatments for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were cost-effective compared with vancomycin (ICER up to $21\u2009488 per treatment success, all 16 studies' ICERs<WTP). Infection control measures such as hand hygiene and gown usage (ICER=$1160\/QALY or $4949 per ABR case averted, all ICERs<WTP) and PCR or chromogenic agar screening for ABR detection were highly cost-effective (eg, ICER=$1206 and $1115 per life-year saved in Europe and the USA). Comparisons were hindered by within-study differences.Robust information on ABR interventions is critical for efficient resource allocation. We highlight cost-effective strategies for mitigating ABR in hospitals, emphasising substantial knowledge gaps, especially in low-income and middle-income countries.

We present five years of surveillance on newly established populations of I. affinis throughout southeastern Virginia and discuss the habitat and host associations of I. affinis in this northernmost extent of its range. We found that I. affinis populations tend to persist once they are established, and populations tend to increase as ecological succession progresses, provided a vegetated understory persists. Populations of I. affinis were never found in the smallest habitat fragments or in xeric dune habitats, and the highest densities of I. affinis were found in mixed pine-hardwood forests with an herbaceous understory. We also document several new mammalian hosts for I. affinis, including house mice (Mus musculus) and coyotes (Canis latrans) and discuss how these hosts may facilitate the continued dispersal of I. affinis and the maintenance of these newly established populations.","1051":"This report describes SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance conducted by the Department of Defense (DoD) Global Emerging Infections Surveillance Branch and the Next-Generation Sequencing and Bioinformatics Consortium (NGSBC) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Samples and sequence data were from SARS-CoV-2 infections occurring among Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries from 1 March to 31 December 2020. There were 1,366 MHS samples sequenced from 10 countries, 36 U.S states or territories, and 5 Geographic Combatant Commands, representing approximately 2% of DoD cases in 2020. Genomes from these samples were compared with other public sequences; observed trends were similar to those of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention national surveillance in the U.S. with B.1, B.1.2, and other sub-lineages comprising the dominant variants of SARS-CoV-2. Sequence data were used to monitor transmission dynamics on U.S. Navy ships and at military training centers and installations. As new variants emerge, DoD medical and public health practitioners should maximize the use of genomic surveillance resources within DoD to inform force health protection measures.","1052":" for 218 of these isolates demonstrated many non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms; the most frequent mutations were G1128R (69% of isolates mixed or mutant), Q1081K\/R (68%), G223S (25%), N1045K (16%) and D1116G\/N\/Y (16%). The G223S mutation was associated with decreased susceptibility to SJ733, PA92 and KAE609. The D1116G\/N\/Y mutations were associated with decreased susceptibility to SJ733, and the presence of mutations at both codons 223 and 1116 was associated with decreased susceptibility to PA92 and SJ733. In all of these cases, absolute differences in susceptibilities of wild type (WT) and mutant parasites were modest. Analysis of clones separated from mixed field isolates consistently identified mutant clones as less susceptible than WT. Analysis of isolates from other sites demonstrated presence of the G223S and D1116G\/N\/Y mutations across Uganda. Our results indicate that malaria parasites circulating in Uganda have a number of polymorphisms in PfATP4 and that modestly decreased susceptibility to PfATP4 inhibitors is associated with some mutations now present in Ugandan parasites.","1053":"The rational design of dengue virus (DENV) vaccines requires a detailed understanding of the molecular basis for antibody-mediated immunity. The durably protective antibody response to DENV after primary infection is serotype specific. However, there is an incomplete understanding of the antigenic determinants for DENV type-specific (TS) antibodies, especially for DENV serotype 3, which has only one well-studied, strongly neutralizing human monoclonal antibody (mAb). Here, we investigated the human B cell response in children after natural DENV infection in the endemic area of Nicaragua and isolated 15 DENV3 TS mAbs recognizing the envelope (E) glycoprotein. Functional epitope mapping of these mAbs and small animal prophylaxis studies revealed a complex landscape with protective epitopes clustering in at least 6-7 antigenic sites. Potently neutralizing TS mAbs recognized sites principally in E glycoprotein domains I and II, and patterns suggest frequent recognition of quaternary structures on the surface of viral particles.","1054":"Forecasting the impacts of climate change on Aedes-borne viruses-especially dengue, chikungunya, and Zika-is a key component of public health preparedness. We apply an empirically parameterized model of viral transmission by the vectors Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus, as a function of temperature, to predict cumulative monthly global transmission risk in current climates, and compare them with projected risk in 2050 and 2080 based on general circulation models (GCMs). Our results show that if mosquito range shifts track optimal temperature ranges for transmission (21.3-34.0\u00b0C for Ae. aegypti; 19.9-29.4\u00b0C for Ae. albopictus), we can expect poleward shifts in Aedes-borne virus distributions. However, the differing thermal niches of the two vectors produce different patterns of shifts under climate change. More severe climate change scenarios produce larger population exposures to transmission by Ae. aegypti, but not by Ae. albopictus in the most extreme cases. Climate-driven risk of transmission from both mosquitoes will increase substantially, even in the short term, for most of Europe. In contrast, significant reductions in climate suitability are expected for Ae. albopictus, most noticeably in southeast Asia and west Africa. Within the next century, nearly a billion people are threatened with new exposure to virus transmission by both Aedes spp. in the worst-case scenario. As major net losses in year-round transmission risk are predicted for Ae. albopictus, we project a global shift towards more seasonal risk across regions. Many other complicating factors (like mosquito range limits and viral evolution) exist, but overall our results indicate that while climate change will lead to increased net and new exposures to Aedes-borne viruses, the most extreme increases in Ae. albopictus transmission are predicted to occur at intermediate climate change scenarios.","1055":"Multi-drug combinations to treat bacterial populations are at the forefront of approaches for infection control and prevention of antibiotic resistance. Although the evolution of antibiotic resistance has been theoretically studied with mathematical population dynamics models, extensions to spatial dynamics remain rare in the literature, including in particular spatial evolution of multi-drug resistance. In this study, we propose a reaction-diffusion system that describes the multi-drug evolution of bacteria based on a drug-concentration rescaling approach. We show how the resistance to drugs in space, and the consequent adaptation of growth rate, is governed by a Price equation with diffusion, integrating features of drug interactions and collateral resistances or sensitivities to the drugs. We study spatial versions of the model where the distribution of drugs is homogeneous across space, and where the drugs vary environmentally in a piecewise-constant, linear and nonlinear manner. Although in many evolution models, per capita growth rate is a natural surrogate for fitness, in spatially-extended, potentially heterogeneous habitats, fitness is an emergent property that potentially reflects additional complexities, from boundary conditions to the specific spatial variation of growth rates. Applying concepts from perturbation theory and reaction-diffusion equations, we propose an analytical metric for characterization of average mutant fitness in the spatial system based on the principal eigenvalue of our linear problem, \u03bb1. This enables an accurate translation from drug spatial gradients and mutant antibiotic susceptibility traits to the relative advantage of each mutant across the environment. Our approach allows one to predict the precise outcomes of selection among mutants over space, ultimately from comparing their \u03bb1 values, which encode a critical interplay between growth functions, movement traits, habitat size and boundary conditions. Such mathematical understanding opens new avenues for multi-drug therapeutic optimization.","1056":"Bedsharing rates were 38%, with higher rates in younger (48%) vs. older (30%) children (p<0.001). In adjusted models, bedsharing was associated with about 30 minutes shorter actigraphy-derived nocturnal sleep duration (p=0.005) and parent-reported later sleep midpoint (p< 0.005) in younger children. In older children, associations of bedsharing with shorter parent-reported sleep duration were more pronounced in children with greater SDB symptom burden (p=0.02), and in children with higher ratings of anxiety (p=0.048) and depressive symptoms (p=0.02).Registry: ClinicalTrials.gov; Name: Pediatric Adenotonsillectomy for Snoring (PATS); Identifier: NCT02562040.In children with mild SDB, bedsharing is associated with shorter sleep duration and later sleep timing in younger children. In older children, these relationships were modified by child factors, including SDB symptom burden and internalizing symptoms. These findings suggest that whereas age and parenting factors may play a greater role in the younger group, SDB and internalizing symptoms may play more of a role in older children who bedshare, suggesting the need to address co-occurring medical and emotional problems in children with SDB.Examine sleep patterns in children with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) who habitually bedshare.We evaluated associations of bedsharing with parent-reported (n=457) and actigraphy-based (n=258) sleep patterns in a diverse child sample (mean age 6.6\u00b12.3 years, range 3.0-12.9) with mild SDB using baseline data from the Pediatric Adenotonsillectomy Trial for Snoring. Multivariable linear regressions examined associations between sleep patterns and bedsharing, adjusting for sociodemographic, child, and parent\/environmental factors. Moderation effects were investigated using interaction terms. Analyses were stratified by age, categorizing children as younger (<6) and older (\u22656) years.","1057":"In our simulation study, no single method consistently outperformed the others, but a researcher's toolkit should include all methodologic options. Our simulations and associated R package can help researchers choose the most appropriate approach for their data.We conducted a simulation study to examine how differing magnitudes of confounding affected the performance of 4 methods used for policy evaluations: (1) the two-way fixed effects difference-in-differences model; (2) a 1-period lagged autoregressive model; (3) augmented synthetic control method; and (4) the doubly robust difference-in-differences approach with multiple time periods from Callaway-Sant'Anna. We simulated our data to have staggered policy adoption and multiple confounding scenarios (i.e., varying the magnitude and nature of confounding relationships).Bias increased for each method: (1) as confounding magnitude increases; (2) when confounding is generated with respect to prior outcome trends (rather than levels), and (3) when confounding associations are nonlinear (rather than linear). The autoregressive model and augmented synthetic control method had notably lower root mean squared error than the two-way fixed effects and Callaway-Sant'Anna approaches for all scenarios; the exception is nonlinear confounding by prior trends, where Callaway-Sant'Anna excels. Coverage rates were unreasonably high for the augmented synthetic control method (e.g., 100%), reflecting large model-based standard errors and wide confidence intervals in practice.Policy evaluation studies that assess how state-level policies affect health-related outcomes are foundational to health and social policy research. The relative ability of newer analytic methods to address confounding, a key source of bias in observational studies, has not been closely examined.","1058":"InterVax-Tool facilitates structured, transparent, and collaborative discussion of trial design, while recording the decision-making process. Users can save and share their decisions, which is useful both for comparing proposed trial designs, and for justifying particular design choices. Here, we describe the goals and features of InterVax-Tool as well as its application to the design of a Zika vaccine efficacy trial.Trial design decisions are complex and interrelated, but current guidance documents do not lend themselves to efficient decision-making. We created InterVax-Tool (http:\/\/vaxeval.com), an online, interactive decision-support tool, to help diverse stakeholders navigate the decisions in the design of phase III vaccine trials. InterVax-Tool offers high-level visual and interactive assistance through a set of four decision trees, guiding users through selection of the: (1) Primary Endpoint, (2) Target Population, (3) Randomization Scheme, and, (4) Comparator. We provide guidance on how key considerations - grouped as Epidemiological, Vaccine-related, Infrastructural, or Sociocultural - inform each decision in the trial design process.Licensed vaccines are urgently needed for emerging infectious diseases, but the nature of these epidemics causes challenges for the design of phase III trials to evaluate vaccine efficacy. Designing and executing rigorous, fast, and ethical, vaccine efficacy trials is difficult, and the decisions and limitations in the design of these trials encompass epidemiological, logistical, regulatory, statistical, and ethical dimensions.","1059":"The Zika pandemic sparked intense interest in whether immune interactions among dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 (DENV1 to -4) extend to the closely related Zika virus (ZIKV). We investigated prospective pediatric cohorts in Nicaragua that experienced sequential DENV1 to -3 (2004 to 2015), Zika (2016 to 2017), and DENV2 (2018 to 2020) epidemics. Risk of symptomatic DENV2 infection and severe disease was elevated by one prior ZIKV infection, one prior DENV infection, or one prior DENV infection followed by one ZIKV infection, compared with being flavivirus-na\u00efve. By contrast, multiple prior DENV infections reduced dengue risk. Further, although high preexisting anti-DENV antibody titers protected against DENV1, DENV3, and ZIKV disease, intermediate titers induced by previous ZIKV or DENV infection enhanced future risk of DENV2 disease and severity, as well as DENV3 severity. The observation that prior ZIKV infection can modulate dengue disease severity like a DENV serotype poses challenges to development of dengue and Zika vaccines.","1060":"Ehrlichia chaffeensis is a tick-borne disease transmitted by ticks to dogs. Few studies have mathematical modelled such tick-borne disease in dogs, and none have developed models that incorporate different ticks' developmental stages (discrete variable) as well as the duration of infection (continuous variable). In this study, we develop and analyze a model that considers these two structural variables using integrated semigroups theory. We address the well-posedness of the model and investigate the existence of steady states. The model exhibits a disease-free equilibrium and an endemic equilibrium. We calculate the reproduction number (T0). We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the bifurcation of an endemic equilibrium. Specifically, we demonstrate that a bifurcation, either backward or forward, can occur at T0=1, leading to the existence, or not, of an endemic equilibrium even when T0<1. Finally, numerical simulations are employed to illustrate these theoretical findings.","1061":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major cause of dementia, disability, and death in the elderly. Despite recent advances in our understanding of the basic biological mechanisms underlying AD, we do not know how to prevent it, nor do we have an approved disease-modifying intervention.

The multifaceted nature of COVID-19 demands a multidisciplinary approach, but the urgency of the crisis combined with the need for social distancing measures present unique challenges to collaborative science. We applied a massive online open publishing approach to this problem using Manubot. Through GitHub, collaborators summarized and critiqued COVID-19 literature, creating a review manuscript. Manubot automatically compiled citation information for referenced preprints, journal publications, websites, and clinical trials. Continuous integration workflows retrieved up-to-date data from online sources nightly, regenerating some of the manuscript's figures and statistics. Manubot rendered the manuscript into PDF, HTML, LaTeX, and DOCX outputs, immediately updating the version available online upon the integration of new content. Through this effort, we organized over 50 scientists from a range of backgrounds who evaluated over 1,500 sources and developed seven literature reviews. While many efforts from the computational community have focused on mining COVID-19 literature, our project illustrates the power of open publishing to organize both technical and non-technical scientists to aggregate and disseminate information in response to an evolving crisis.","1064":"The COVID-19 pandemic offers an unprecedented natural experiment providing insights into the emergence of collective behavioral changes of both exogenous (government mandated) and endogenous (spontaneous reaction to infection risks) origin. Here, we characterize collective physical distancing-mobility reductions, minimization of contacts, shortening of contact duration-in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the pre-vaccine era by analyzing de-identified, privacy-preserving location data for a panel of over 5.5 million anonymized, opted-in U.S. devices. We define five indicators of users' mobility and proximity to investigate how the emerging collective behavior deviates from typical pre-pandemic patterns during the first nine months of the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyze both the dramatic changes due to the government mandated mitigation policies and the more spontaneous societal adaptation into a new (physically distanced) normal in the fall 2020. Using the indicators here defined we show that: a) during the COVID-19 pandemic, collective physical distancing displayed different phases and was heterogeneous across geographies, b) metropolitan areas displayed stronger reductions in mobility and contacts than rural areas; c) stronger reductions in commuting patterns are observed in geographical areas with a higher share of teleworkable jobs; d) commuting volumes during and after the lockdown period negatively correlate with unemployment rates; and e) increases in contact indicators correlate with future values of new deaths at a lag consistent with epidemiological parameters and surveillance reporting delays. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the framework and indicators here presented can be used to analyze large-scale social distancing phenomena, paving the way for their use in future pandemics to analyze and monitor the effects of pandemic mitigation plans at the national and international levels.","1065":"Participants received personalized weekly coupons with nutrition education during the intervention period (A) and occasional generic coupons with nutrition education during the control period (B).

Data analysis was performed from September 2019 to May 2020.This pilot trial demonstrated preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of a novel personalized healthy food incentive algorithm to improve grocery purchase dietary quality.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03748056.The analytical sample included 209 participants (104 in group 1 and 105 in group 2), with a mean (SD) age of 55.4 (14.0) years. They were predominantly non-Hispanic White (193 of 206 participants [94.1%]) and female (187 of 207 participants [90.3%]). Of 161 participants with income data, 81 (50.3%) had annual household incomes greater than or equal to $100\u202f000. Paired t tests showed that the intervention increased GPQI-16 scores (between-group difference, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.27-1.86; P\u2009=\u2009.01) and percentage spending on targeted foods (between-group difference, 1.38%; 95% CI, 0.08%-2.69%; P\u2009=\u2009.04). During the initial intervention period, group 1 (AB) and group 2 (BA) had similar mean (SD) GPQI-16 scores (41.2 [6.6] vs 41.0 [7.5]) and mean (SD) percentage spending on targeted healthy foods (32.0% [10.8%] vs 31.0% [10.5%]). During the crossover intervention period, group 2 had a higher mean (SD) GPQI-16 score than group 1 (42.9 [7.7] vs 41.0 [6.8]) and mean (SD) percentage spending on targeted foods (34.0% [12.1%] vs 32.0% [13.1%]).","1066":"Given current age-specific estimates of the COVID-19 fatality ratio and the age structure of the population in Antananarivo, we estimate that as few as 11 deaths per week in the 60-70 years age group (corresponding to an infection rate of approximately 1%) would detectably exceed the baseline. Data from 2020 will undergo necessary processing and quality control in the coming months. Our results provide a baseline for interpreting this information.Quantitative estimates of the impact of infectious disease outbreaks are required to develop measured policy responses. In many low- and middle-income countries, inadequate surveillance and incompleteness of death registration are important barriers.The weekly mortality rate of children during the 2018-2019 measles outbreak was 161% above the expected value at its peak, and the signal can be detected earlier in children than in the general population. This approach to detect anomalies from expected baseline mortality allows us to delineate the prevalence of COVID-19 at which excess mortality would be detectable with the existing death notification system in Antananarivo.Here, we characterize how large an impact on mortality would have to be for being detectable using the uniquely detailed mortality notification data from the city of Antananarivo, Madagascar, with application to a recent measles outbreak.","1067":"Network science enables the effective analysis of real interconnected systems, characterized by a complex interplay between topology and interconnections strength. It is well-known that the topology of a network affects its resilience to failures or attacks, as well as its functions. Exchanging information is crucial for many real systems: the internet, transportation networks and the brain are key examples. Despite the introduction of measures of efficiency to analyze network flows, i.e. topologies characterized by weighted connectivity, here we show that they fail to capture combined information of link existence and link weight. In this letter we propose a physically-grounded estimator of flow efficiency which can be computed for every weighted network, regardless from the scale and nature of weights and from any (missing) metadata. Remarkably, results show that our estimator captures the heterogeneity of flows along with topological differences and its complement information obtained from percolation analysis of several empirical systems, including transportation, trade, migrations, and brain networks. We show that cutting the heaviest connections may increase the average communication efficiency of the system and hence, counterintuively, a sparser network is not necessarily less efficient. Remarkably, our estimator enables the comparison of communication efficiency of networks arising from different fields, without the possible pitfalls deriving from the scale of flow.","1068":"The relationship between rainfall, especially extreme rainfall, and increases in waterborne infectious diseases is widely reported in the literature. Most of this research, however, has not formally considered the impact of exposure measurement error contributed by the limited spatiotemporal fidelity of precipitation data. Here, we evaluate bias in effect estimates associated with exposure misclassification due to precipitation data fidelity, using extreme rainfall as an example. We accomplished this via a simulation study, followed by analysis of extreme rainfall and incident diarrheal disease in an epidemiologic study in Ecuador. We found that the limited fidelity typical of spatiotemporal rainfall data sets biases effect estimates towards the null. Use of spatial interpolations of rain-gauge data or satellite data biased estimated health effects due to extreme rainfall (occurrence) and wet conditions (accumulated totals) downwards by 35%-45%. Similar biases were evident in the Ecuadorian case study analysis, where spatial incompatibility between exposed populations and rain gauges resulted in the association between extreme rainfall and diarrheal disease incidence being approximately halved. These findings suggest that investigators should pay greater attention to limitations in using spatially heterogeneous environmental data sets to assign exposures in epidemiologic research.","1069":"Obtaining reasonable estimates for transmission rates from observed data is a challenge when using mathematical models to study the dynamics of ?infectious? diseases, like Ebola. Most models assume the transmission rate of a contagion either does not vary over time or change in a fixed pre-determined adhoc ways. However, these rates do vary during an outbreak due to multitude of factors such as environmental conditions, social behaviors, and public-health interventions deployed to control the disease, which are in-part guided by changing size of an outbreak. We derive analytical estimates of time-dependent transmission rate for an epidemic in terms of either incidence or prevalence using a standard mathematical SIR-type epidemic model. We illustrate applicability of our method by applying data on various public health problems, including infectious diseases (Ebola, SARS, and Leishmaniasis) and social issues (obesity and alcohol drinking) to compute transmission rates over time. We show that time-dependent transmission rate estimates can have a large variation, depending on the type of available data and other epidemiological parameters. Time-dependent estimation of transmission rates captures the dynamics of the problem better and can be utilized to understand disease progression more accurately.","1070":"Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF\u03b21) plays a central role in normal and aberrant wound healing, but the precise mechanism in the local environment remains elusive. Here, using a mouse model of aberrant wound healing resulting in heterotopic ossification (HO) after traumatic injury, we find autocrine TGF\u03b21 signaling in macrophages, and not mesenchymal stem\/progenitor cells (MPCs), is critical in HO formation. In-depth single cell transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses in combination with immunostaining of cells from the injury site demonstrate increased TGF\u03b21 signaling in early infiltrating macrophages, with open chromatin regions in TGF\u03b21 stimulated genes at binding sites specific for transcription factors of activated TGF\u03b21 (SMAD2\/3). Genetic deletion of TGF\u03b21 receptor type 1, (Tgfbr1;Alk5) in macrophages, results in increased HO, with a trend toward decreased tendinous HO. To bypass the effect seen by altering the receptor we administered a systemic treatment with TGF\u03b21\/3 ligand trap TGF\u03b2RII-Fc, which results in decreased HO formation and a delay macrophage infiltration to the injury site. Overall, our data support the role of the TGF\u03b21\/ALK5 signaling pathway in HO.","1071":"Antibodies result from the competition of B cell lineages evolving under selection for improved antigen recognition, a process known as affinity maturation. High-affinity antibodies to pathogens such as HIV, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2 are frequently reported to arise from B cells whose receptors, the precursors to antibodies, are encoded by particular immunoglobulin alleles. This raises the possibility that the presence of particular germline alleles in the B cell repertoire is a major determinant of the quality of the antibody response. Alternatively, initial differences in germline alleles' propensities to form high-affinity receptors might be overcome by chance events during affinity maturation. We first investigate these scenarios in simulations: when germline-encoded fitness differences are large relative to the rate and effect size variation of somatic mutations, the same germline alleles persistently dominate the response of different individuals. In contrast, if germline-encoded advantages can be easily overcome by subsequent mutations, allele usage becomes increasingly divergent over time, a pattern we then observe in mice experimentally infected with influenza virus. We investigated whether affinity maturation might nonetheless strongly select for particular amino acid motifs across diverse genetic backgrounds, but we found no evidence of convergence to similar CDR3 sequences or amino acid substitutions. These results suggest that although germline-encoded specificities can lead to similar immune responses between individuals, diverse evolutionary routes to high affinity limit the genetic predictability of responses to infection and vaccination.","1072":"Dissimilar estimates of protection against RVGE may be due in part to age-related, antibody-independent risk for rotavirus infections to cause RVGE.Risk for primary, secondary, and subsequent infections to cause RVGE decreased per log-month of age by 28% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12%-41%), 69% (95% CI, 30%-86%), and 64% (95% CI, -186% to 95%), respectively, in Mexico City, and by 10% (95% CI, -1% to 19%), 51% (95% CI, 41%-59%) and 67% (95% CI, 57%-75%), respectively, in Vellore. Elevated serum immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G titers were associated with partial protection against rotavirus infection. Associations between older age and reduced risk for RVGE or moderate-to-severe RVGE given infection persisted after controlling for antibody levels.We reanalyzed data from 200 Mexican and 373 Indian children followed from birth to 2 and 3 years of age, respectively. We reassessed protection against RVGE, decomposing the incidence rate into the rate of rotavirus infection and the risk of RVGE given infection, and tested for serum antibody correlates of protection using regression models.Observational studies in socioeconomically distinct populations have yielded conflicting conclusions about the strength of naturally acquired immunity against rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE), mirroring vaccine underperformance in low-income countries. We revisited birth cohort studies to understand naturally acquired protection against rotavirus infection and RVGE.","1073":"Community-based.Participants underwent 7 days of continuous wrist actigraphy and completed daily sleep diaries. Studies were scored twice by each of two scorers. Rest intervals were set using a standardized hierarchical approach based on event marker, diary, light, and activity data. Sleep\/wake status was then determined for each 30-sec epoch using a validated algorithm, and this was used to generate 11 variables: mean nightly sleep duration, nap duration, 24-h sleep duration, sleep latency, sleep maintenance efficiency, sleep fragmentation index, sleep onset time, sleep offset time, sleep midpoint time, standard deviation of sleep duration, and standard deviation of sleep midpoint. Intra-scorer intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were high, ranging from 0.911 to 0.995 across all 11 variables. Similarly, inter-scorer ICCs were high, also ranging from 0.911 to 0.995, and mean inter-scorer differences were small. Bland-Altman plots did not reveal any systematic disagreement in scoring.Observational study.With use of a standardized algorithm to set rest intervals, scoring of actigraphy for the purpose of generating a wide array of sleep variables is highly reproducible.While actigraphy is considered objective, the process of setting rest intervals to calculate sleep variables is subjective. We sought to evaluate the reproducibility of actigraphy-derived measures of sleep using a standardized algorithm for setting rest intervals.N\/A.A random sample of 50 adults aged 18-64 years free of severe sleep apnea participating in the Sue\u00f1o sleep ancillary study to the Hispanic Community Health Study\/Study of Latinos.","1074":" This study provides insight into the mechanisms of resistance in a large collection of clinical non-O157 STEC isolates and demonstrates that antibiotic resistance among all STEC serogroups has increased over time, prompting the need for enhanced surveillance.","1075":"Patients with non-diabetic CKD INTERVENTION: Dapagliflozin plus standard care versus standard care only.Determine the cost-effectiveness of adding dapagliflozin to standard management of patients with non-diabetic CKD.Markov model with lifetime time horizon and US healthcare sector perspective.Adding dapagliflozin to standard care improved life expectancy by 2 years, increased discounted QALYS (from 6.75 to 8.06), and reduced the total incidence of kidney failure on kidney replacement therapy (KRT) (from 17.4 to 11.0%) and average years on KRT (from 0.77 to 0.43) over the lifetime of the cohort. Dapagliflozin plus standard care was more effective than standard care alone while increasing lifetime costs (from $245,900 to $324,8900, or $60,000 per QALY gained). Results were robust to variations in assumptions about dapagliflozin's efficacy over time and by CKD stage, added costs of kidney replacement therapy, and expected population annual CKD progression rates and sensitive to the cost of dapagliflozin. The net 1-year budgetary implication of treating all US patients with non-diabetic CKD could be up to $21 billion.Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), all discounted at 3% annually; total incidence of kidney failure on kidney replacement therapy; average years on kidney replacement therapy.In the USA, chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 1 in 7 adults and costs $100 billion annually. The DAPA-CKD trial found dapagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, to be effective in reducing CKD progression and mortality in patients with diabetic and non-diabetic CKD. Currently, SGLT2 inhibitors are not considered standard of care for patients with non-diabetic CKD.Dapagliflozin improved life expectancy and reduced progression of CKD, the proportion of patients requiring kidney replacement therapy, and time on kidney replacement therapy in patients with non-diabetic CKD. Use of dapagliflozin meets conventional criteria for cost-effectiveness.","1076":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, several countries have resorted to self-adaptive mechanisms that tailor non-pharmaceutical interventions to local epidemiological and health care indicators. These mechanisms reinforce the mutual influence between containment measures and the evolution of the epidemic. To account for such interplay, we develop an epidemiological model that embeds an algorithm mimicking the self-adaptive policy mechanism effective in Italy between November 2020 and March 2022. This extension is key to tracking the historical evolution of health outcomes and restrictions in Italy. Focusing on the epidemic wave that started in mid-2021 after the diffusion of Delta, we compare the functioning of alternative mechanisms to show how the policy framework may affect the trade-off between health outcomes and the restrictiveness of mitigation measures. Mechanisms based on the reproduction number are generally highly responsive to early signs of a surging wave but entail severe restrictions. The emerging trade-off varies considerably depending on specific conditions (e.g., vaccination coverage), with less-reactive mechanisms (e.g., those based on occupancy rates) becoming more appealing in favorable contexts.","1077":"Hand hygiene in health care facilities (HCFs) remains a significant public health challenge. Global baseline estimates on water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) in HCFs indicate that 26% of HCFs lack access to an improved water source on the premises. In this study, we sought to assess the proportion of handwashing coverage and the associated factors among healthcare workers in public and private healthcare facilities in Ndejje division, Makindye Ssabagabo municipality, Wakiso district.The majority of 350 (92.6%) of healthcare workers were from private health facilities. We found out that the proportion of handwashing facilities coverage was 97.7%. The proportion of handwashing was good coupled with a positive attitude towards handwashing. Being a nurse was highly associated with washing hands in both private and public health facilities.A descriptive cross-sectional study with both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection was conducted. A total of 350 healthcare workers were interviewed using a self-administered structured open-ended paper questionnaire and Focus Group Discussions (FGD) guide. Data was analysed using STATA 14.2 and ATLAS. ti version 8 software.High hand washing proportion was attributed to the COVID-19 guidelines and enforcement which sparked adherence to the standard operating procedures.","1078":"Fred Brauer (1932-2021), one of the pioneers of mathematical population biology, shaped generations of researchers through his lines of research, his books which have become key references in the field, and his mentoring of junior researchers.

In this paper, we present a large-scale agent-based model of policy interventions that could have been implemented to mitigate the Omicron wave. Our model takes into account the behaviors of individuals and their interactions with one another within a nationally representative population, as well as the efficacy of various interventions such as social distancing, mask wearing, testing, tracing, and vaccination. We use the model to simulate the impact of different policy scenarios and evaluate their potential effectiveness in controlling the spread of the virus. Our results suggest the Omicron wave could have been substantially curtailed via a combination of interventions comparable in effectiveness to extreme and unpopular singular measures such as widespread closure of schools and workplaces, and highlight the importance of early and decisive action.","1080":"A consensus species tree is reconstructed from 11 gene trees for human, bat, and pangolin beta coronaviruses from samples taken early in the pandemic (prior to April 1, 2020). Using coalescent theory, the shallow (short branches relative to the hosts) consensus species tree provides evidence of recent gene flow events between bat and pangolin beta coronaviruses predating the zoonotic transfer to humans. The consensus species tree was also used to reconstruct the ancestral sequence of human SARS-CoV-2, which was 2 nucleotides different from the Wuhan sequence. The time to most recent common ancestor was estimated to be Dec 8, 2019 with a bat origin. Some human, bat, and pangolin coronavirus lineages found in China are phylogenetically distinct, a rare example of a class II phylogeography pattern (Avise et al. in Ann Rev Eco Syst 18:489-422, 1987). The consensus species tree is a product of evolutionary factors, providing evidence of repeated zoonotic transfers between bat and pangolin as a reservoir for future zoonotic transfers to humans.","1081":"Through validation against diverse data sets from the literature, we demonstrate the reliability and versatility of our approach in predicting the time evolution of the disease and assessing the potential efficacy of radiotherapy-immunotherapy combinations. This further supports the promising potential of the abscopal effect, suggesting that in select cases, depending on tumor size, it may confer full efficacy to radiotherapy.While radiotherapy has long been recognized for its ability to directly ablate cancer cells through necrosis or apoptosis, radiotherapy-induced abscopal effect suggests that its impact extends beyond local tumor destruction thanks to immune response. Cellular proliferation and necrosis have been extensively studied using mathematical models that simulate tumor growth, such as Gompertz law, and the radiation effects, such as the linear-quadratic model. However, the effectiveness of radiotherapy-induced immune responses may vary among patients due to individual differences in radiation sensitivity and other factors.Our method leverages macroscopic observations and mathematical modeling to capture the overarching dynamics of this interplay, offering valuable insights for optimizing cancer treatment strategies. One shows that Gompertz law can describe therapy effects with two effective parameters. This result permits quantitative data analyses, which give useful indications for the disease progression and clinical decisions.We present a novel macroscopic approach designed to quantitatively analyze the intricate dynamics governing the interactions among the immune system, radiotherapy, and tumor progression. Building upon previous research demonstrating the synergistic effects of radiotherapy and immunotherapy in cancer treatment, we provide a comprehensive mathematical framework for understanding the underlying mechanisms driving these interactions.","1082":"In early 2020, Ecuador reported one of the highest surges of per capita deaths across the globe.We collected a comprehensive dataset containing individual death records between 2015 and 2020, from the Ecuadorian National Institute of Statistics and Census and the Ecuadorian Ministry of Government. We computed the number of excess deaths across time, geographical locations and demographic groups using Poisson regression methods.Between 1 January and 23 September 2020, the number of excess deaths in Ecuador was 36 402 [95% confidence interval (CI): 35 762-36 827] or 208 per 100 000 people, which is 171% of the expected deaths in that period in a typical year. Only 20% of the excess deaths are attributable to confirmed COVID-19 deaths. Strikingly, in provinces that were most affected by COVID-19 such as Guayas and Santa Elena, the all-cause deaths are more than double the expected number of deaths that would have occurred in a normal year. The extent of excess deaths in men is higher than in women, and the number of excess deaths increases with age. Indigenous populations had the highest level of excess deaths among all ethnic groups.Overall, the exceptionally high level of excess deaths in Ecuador highlights the enormous burden and heterogeneous impact of COVID-19 on mortality, especially in older age groups and Indigenous populations in Ecuador, which was not fully revealed by COVID-19 death counts. Together with the limited testing in Ecuador, our results suggest that the majority of the excess deaths were likely to be undocumented COVID-19 deaths.","1083":"The ubiquity of smartphones, with their increasingly sophisticated array of sensors, presents an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to collect longitudinal, diverse, temporally-dense data about human behavior while minimizing participant burden. Researchers increasingly make use of smartphones for \"digital phenotyping,\" the collection and analysis of raw phone sensor and log data to study the lived experiences of subjects in their natural environments using their own devices. While digital phenotyping has shown promise in fields such as psychiatry and neuroscience, there are fundamental gaps in our knowledge about data collection and non-collection (i.e., missing data) in smartphone-based digital phenotyping. In this meta-study using individual-level data from six different studies, we examined accelerometer and GPS sensor data of 211 participants, amounting to 29,500 person-days of observation, using Bayesian hierarchical negative binomial regression with study- and\u00a0user-level random intercepts. Sensitivity analyses including alternative model specification and stratified models were conducted. We found that iOS users had lower GPS non-collection than Android users. For GPS data, rates of non-collection did not differ by race\/ethnicity, education, age, or gender. For accelerometer data, Black participants had higher rates of non-collection, but rates did not differ by sex, education, or age. For both sensors, non-collection increased by 0.5% to 0.9% per week. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using smartphone-based digital phenotyping across diverse populations, for extended periods of time, and within diverse cohorts. As smartphones become increasingly embedded in everyday life, the insights of this study will help guide the design, planning, and analysis of digital phenotyping studies.","1084":"The evolution and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes throughout the world are clearly affected by the selection and migration of resistant bacteria. However, the relative contributions of selection and migration at a local scale have not been fully explored. We sought to identify which of these factors has the strongest effect through comparisons of antibiotic resistance gene abundance between a distinct location and its surroundings over an extended period of six years. In this work, we used two repositories of extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates collected since 2013 from patients at Dignity Health Mercy Medical Center (DHMMC) in Merced, California, USA, and a nationwide database compiled from clinical isolate genomes reported by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) since 2013. We analyzed the stability of average resistance gene frequencies over the years since collection of these clinical isolates began for each repository. We then compared the frequencies of resistance genes in the DHMMC collection with the averages of the nationwide frequencies. We found DHMMC gene frequencies are stable over time and differ significantly from nationwide frequencies throughout the period of time we examined. Our results suggest that local selective pressures are a more important influence on the population structure of resistance genes in bacterial populations than migration. This, in turn, indicates the potential for antibiotic resistance to be controlled at a regional level, making it easier to limit the spread through local stewardship.","1085":"The aim of epidemiology is to understand the causes of a disease in order to predict its\r\nevolution and then make decisions to contain the epidemic.

Diagnostic criteria that attribute symptoms to a pathogen which is detectable, whether it is or is not the aetiological agent of disease, may lead to outcome misclassification in epidemiological studies. Case-control studies are commonly undertaken to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) and present an opportunity to compare pathogen detection among individuals with and without clinically relevant symptoms. Considering this study context, we present a mathematical framework yielding simple estimators for the direct effects of vaccination on various aspects of host susceptibility. These include protection against acquisition of the pathogen of interest and protection against progression of this pathogen to disease following acquisition. We assess the impact of test sensitivity on these estimators and extend our framework to identify a 'vaccine probe' estimator for pathogen-specific aetiological fractions. We also derive biases affecting VE estimates under the test-negative design, a special case enrolling only symptomatic persons. Our results provide strategies for estimating pathogen-specific VE in the absence of a diagnostic gold standard. These approaches can inform the design and analysis of studies addressing numerous pathogens and vaccines.","1087":"Astroviruses (AstVs) can cause of severe infection of the central nervous system (CNS) in immunocompromised individuals. Here, we identified a human AstV of the VA1 genotype, HAstV-NIH, as the cause of fatal encephalitis in an immunocompromised adult. We investigated the cells targeted by AstV, neurophysiological changes, and host responses by analyzing gene expression, protein expression, and cellular morphology in brain tissue from three cases of AstV neurologic disease (AstV-ND). We demonstrate that neurons are the principal cells targeted by AstV in the brain and that the cerebellum and brainstem have the highest burden of infection. Detection of VA1 AstV in interconnected brain structures such as thalamus, deep cerebellar nuclei, Purkinje cells, and pontine nuclei indicates that AstV may spread between connected neurons transsynaptically. We found transcriptional dysregulation of neural functions and disruption of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic innervation of infected neurons. Importantly, transcriptional dysregulation of neural functions occurred in fatal cases, but not in a patient that survived AstV-ND. We show that the innate, but not adaptive immune response was transcriptionally driving host defense in the brain of immunocompromised patients with AstV-ND. Both transcriptome and molecular pathology studies showed that most of the cellular changes were associated with CNS-intrinsic cells involved in phagocytosis and injury repair (microglia, perivascular\/parenchymal border macrophages, and astrocytes), but not CNS-extrinsic cells (T and B cells), suggesting an imbalance of innate and adaptive immune responses to AstV infection in the brain as a result of the underlying immunodeficiencies. These results show that VA1 AstV infection of the brain in immunocompromised humans is associated with imbalanced host defense responses, disruption of neuronal somatodendritic compartments and synapses and increased phagocytic cellular activity. Improved understanding of the response to viral infections of the human CNS may provide clues for how to manipulate these processes to improve outcomes.","1088":"A retrospective study of children with HCoV detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed for a community cohort and a children's hospital in the same community from January 2013 to December 2014. The RT-PCR assay detected HCoV 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43 in nasal swabs from symptomatic children \u226418 years. Factors associated with increased severity of illness in hospitalized children were assessed by multivariable logistic regression.Children in the community with HCoV detected generally had mild illness as demonstrated by few medically attended cases. In hospitalized children, young age and CCCs, but not HCoV type, were associated with increased severity of illness.Human coronavirus was detected in 261 children, 49 and 212 from the community and hospital, respectively. The distribution of HCoV types and seasonal trends were similar in the community and hospital. Community cases were older than hospitalized cases (median age, 4.4 versus 1.7 years, respectively; P < .01), and a minority of community cases (26.5%) sought medical attention. Among the hospitalized children with HCoV detected, 39 (18.4%) received respiratory support and 24 (11.3%) were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Age <2 years (odds ratio [OR] = 5.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-13.1) and cardiovascular (OR = 3.9; 95% CI, 1.6-9.5), genetic\/congenital (OR = 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1-7.0), and respiratory chronic complex conditions ([CCCs] OR = 4.5; 95% CI, 1.7-12.0) were associated with receiving respiratory support. Genetic\/congenital (OR = 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1-7.4) CCCs were associated with PICU admission. Severity of illness was similar among hospitalized children with different HCoV types.The epidemiology and clinical features of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) in children are not fully characterized.","1089":"The Stokes\u2013Brinkman equations model flow in heterogeneous porous media by combining the Stokes and Darcy models of flow into a single system of equations.

Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Fonds de recherche du Qu\u00e9bec - Sant\u00e9 research.Girls' vaccination could reduce age-standardised cervical cancer incidence from a median of 47.6 (40.9-79.2) in 2020 to 4.5 (3.2-6.3) per 100,000 women-years by 2120, averting on average \u223c4% and \u223c46% of age-standardised cumulative cervical cancer cases over 25 and 100 years, respectively, compared to the basecase. Adding 2 lifetime screens helped achieve elimination over the century among all women (2120 cervical cancer incidence: 3.6 (1.9-3.6) per 100,000 women-years), but not among WLHIV (10.8 (5.3-11.6)), and averted more cumulative cancer cases overall (\u223c45% over 25 years and \u223c61% over 100 years compared to basecase) than girls' vaccination alone. Adding three-yearly cervical screening among WLHIV (to girls' vaccination and 2 lifetime cervical screens) further reduced age-standardised cervical cancer incidence to 3.3 (1.8-3.6) per 100,000 women-years overall and to 5.2 (3.9-8.5) among WLHIV by 2120 and averted on average 12-13% additional cumulative cancer cases among all women and 21-24% among WLHIV than girls' vaccination and 2 lifetime cervical screens over 25 years or longer. Long-term vaccine protection and using the nonavalent vaccine was required for elimination.In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched its initiative to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem. To inform global efforts for countries with high HIV and cervical cancer burden, we assessed the impact of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and cervical cancer screening and treatment in South Africa, on cervical cancer and the potential for achieving elimination before 2120, considering faster HPV disease progression and higher cervical cancer risk among women living with HIV(WLHIV) and HIV interventions.Three independent transmission-dynamic models simulating HIV and HPV infections and disease progression were used to predict the impact on cervical cancer incidence of three scenarios for all women: 1) girls' vaccination (9-14 years old), 2) girls' vaccination plus 1 lifetime cervical screen (at 35 years), and 3) girls' vaccination plus 2 lifetime cervical screens (at 35 and 45 years) and three enhanced scenarios for WLHIV: 4) vaccination of young WLHIV aged 15-24 years, 5) three-yearly cervical screening of WLHIV aged 15-49 years, or 6) both. Vaccination assumed 90% coverage and 100% lifetime protection with the nonavalent vaccine (against HPV-16\/18\/31\/33\/45\/52\/58). Cervical cancer screening assumed HPV testing with uptake increasing from 45% (2023), 70% (2030) to 90% (2045+). We also assumed that UNAIDS 90-90-90 HIV treatment and 70% male circumcision targets are reached by 2030. We examined three elimination thresholds: age-standardised cervical cancer incidence rates below 4 or 10 per 100,000 women-years, and >85% reduction in cervical cancer incidence rate. We conducted sensitivity analyses and presented the median age-standardised predictions of outcomes of the three models (minimum-maximum across models).","1091":"Anthropologists recognize the importance of conceptualizing health in the context of the mutually evolving nature of biology and culture through the biocultural approach, but biocultural anthropological perspectives of infectious diseases and their impacts on humans (and vice versa) through time are relatively underrepresented. Tuberculosis (TB) has been a constant companion of humans for thousands of years and has heavily influenced population health in almost every phase of cultural and demographic evolution. TB in human populations has been dramatically influenced by behavior, demographic and epidemiological shifts, and other comorbidities through history. This paper critically discusses TB and some of its major comorbidities through history within a biocultural framework to show how transitions in human demography and culture affected the disease-scape of TB. In doing so, I address the potential synthesis of biocultural and epidemiological transition theory to better comprehend the mutual evolution of infectious diseases and humans.","1092":"In this paper, we study a mathematical model investigating the impact of unreported cases of the COVID-19 in three North African countries: Algeria, Egypt, and Morocco. To understand how the population respects the restriction of population mobility implemented in each country, we use Google and Apple's mobility reports. These mobility reports help to quantify the effect of the population movement restrictions on the evolution of the active infection cases. We also approximate the number of the population infected unreported, the proportion of those that need hospitalization, and estimate the end of the epidemic wave. Moreover, we use our model to estimate the second wave of the COVID-19 Algeria and Morocco and to project the end of the second wave. Finally, we suggest some additional measures that can be considered to reduce the burden of the COVID-19 and would lead to a second wave of the spread of the virus in these countries.","1093":"We conducted a systematic review of studies that tested \u226510 suspected cholera cases for V. cholerae O1\/O139 using culture, PCR, and\/or a rapid diagnostic test. We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar for studies that sampled at least one suspected case between January 1, 2000 and April 19, 2023, to reflect contemporary patterns in V. cholerae positivity. We estimated diagnostic test sensitivity and specificity using a latent class meta-analysis. We estimated V. cholerae positivity using a random-effects meta-analysis, adjusting for test performance. We included 119 studies from 30 countries. V. cholerae positivity was lower in studies with representative sampling and in studies that set minimum ages in suspected case definitions. After adjusting for test performance, on average, 52% (95% credible interval (CrI): 24%, 80%) of suspected cases represented true V. cholerae infections. After adjusting for test performance and study methodology, the odds of a suspected case having a true infection were 5.71 (odds ratio 95% CrI: 1.53, 15.43) times higher when surveillance was initiated in response to an outbreak than in non-outbreak settings. Variation across studies was high, and a limitation of our approach was that we were unable to explain all the heterogeneity with study-level attributes, including diagnostic test used, setting, and case definitions.Cholera surveillance relies on clinical diagnosis of acute watery diarrhea. Suspected cholera case definitions have high sensitivity but low specificity, challenging our ability to characterize cholera burden and epidemiology. Our objective was to estimate the proportion of clinically suspected cholera that are true Vibrio cholerae infections and identify factors that explain variation in positivity.In this study, we found that burden estimates based on suspected cases alone may overestimate the incidence of medically attended cholera by 2-fold. However, accounting for cases missed by traditional clinical surveillance is key to unbiased cholera burden estimates. Given the substantial variability in positivity between settings, extrapolations from suspected to confirmed cases, which is necessary to estimate cholera incidence rates without exhaustive testing, should be based on local data.","1094":"We incorporated precipitation, minimum temperature, and Ni\u00f1o3\u00b74 index forecasts in a Bayesian hierarchical mixed model to predict dengue incidence. The model was initiated on Jan 1, 2016, producing monthly dengue forecasts until November, 2016. We accounted for misreporting of dengue due to the introduction of chikungunya in 2015, by using active surveillance data to correct reported dengue case data from passive surveillance records. We then evaluated the forecast retrospectively with available epidemiological information.European Union FP7, Royal Society, and National Science Foundation.This dengue prediction framework, which uses seasonal climate and El Ni\u00f1o forecasts, allows a prediction to be made at the start of the year for the entire dengue season. Combining active surveillance data with routine dengue reports improved not only model fit and performance, but also the accuracy of benchmark estimates based on historical seasonal averages. This study advances the state-of-the-art of climate services for the health sector, by showing the potential value of incorporating climate information in the public health decision-making process in Ecuador.El Ni\u00f1o and its effect on local meteorological conditions potentially influences interannual variability in dengue transmission in southern coastal Ecuador. El Oro province is a key dengue surveillance site, due to the high burden of dengue, seasonal transmission, co-circulation of all four dengue serotypes, and the recent introduction of chikungunya and Zika. In this study, we used climate forecasts to predict the evolution of the 2016 dengue season in the city of Machala, following one of the strongest El Ni\u00f1o events on record.The predictions correctly forecast an early peak in dengue incidence in March, 2016, with a 90% chance of exceeding the mean dengue incidence for the previous 5 years. Accounting for the proportion of chikungunya cases that had been incorrectly recorded as dengue in 2015 improved the prediction of the magnitude of dengue incidence in 2016.","1095":"US National Institute of General Medical Sciences, and Fellowship Foundation Ramon Areces.We used a Bayesian modelling approach to estimate the relative capacity for detection of imported cases of COVID-19 for 194 locations (excluding China) compared with that for Singapore. We also built a simple mathematical model of the point prevalence of infection in visitors to an epicentre relative to that in residents.The weighted global ability to detect Wuhan-to-location imported cases of COVID-19 was estimated to be 38% (95% highest posterior density interval [HPDI] 22-64) of Singapore's capacity. This value is equivalent to 2\u00b78 (95% HPDI 1\u00b75-4\u00b74) times the current number of imported and reported cases that could have been detected if all locations had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore was 40% (95% HPDI 22-67) among locations with high surveillance capacity, 37% (18-68) among locations with medium surveillance capacity, and 11% (0-42) among locations with low surveillance capacity. Treating all travellers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travellers in Wuhan) contributed modestly to underestimation of prevalence.The incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, has been estimated using imported case counts of international travellers, generally under the assumptions that all cases of the disease in travellers have been ascertained and that infection prevalence in travellers and residents is the same. However, findings indicate variation among locations in the capacity for detection of imported cases. Singapore has had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact tracing capacity during previous infectious disease outbreaks and has consistently shown high sensitivity of case-detection during the COVID-19 outbreak.Estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of 100% detection in travellers could have been underestimated by several fold. Furthermore, severity estimates will be inflated several fold since they also rely on case count estimates. Finally, our model supports evidence that underdetected cases of COVID-19 have probably spread in most locations around the world, with greatest risk in locations of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicentre of the outbreak.","1096":"Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide and requires regular monitoring upon diagnosis to ascertain whether the disease is stable or progressing. However, making this determination remains a difficult clinical task. Recently, a novel spatiotemporal boundary detection predictor of glaucomatous visual field (VF) progression (STBound) was developed. In this work, we explore the ability of STBound to differentiate progressing and non-progressing glaucoma patients in comparison to existing methods. STBound, Spatial PROGgression, and traditional trend-based progression methods (global index (GI) regression, mean regression slope, point-wise linear regression, permutation of pointwise linear regression) were applied to longitudinal VF data from 191 eyes of 91 glaucoma patients. The ability of each method to identify progression was compared using Akaike information criterion (AIC), full\/partial area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC\/pAUC), sensitivity, and specificity. STBound offered improved diagnostic ability (AIC: 197.77 vs. 204.11-217.55; AUC: 0.74 vs. 0.63-0.70) and showed no correlation (r: -0.01-0.11; p-values: 0.11-0.93) with the competing methods. STBound combined with GI (the top performing competitor) provided improved performance over all individual metrics and compared to all metrics combined with GI (all p-values\u2009<\u20090.05). STBound may be a valuable diagnostic tool and can be used in conjunction with existing methods.","1097":"Many countries worldwide have been affected by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that was first reported in China. To understand and forecast the transmission dynamics of this disease, fractional-order derivative-based modeling can be beneficial. We propose in this paper a fractional-order mathematical model to examine the COVID-19 disease outbreak. This model outlines the multiple mechanisms of transmission within the dynamics of infection. The basic reproduction number and the equilibrium points are calculated from the model to assess the transmissibility of the COVID-19. Sensitivity analysis is discussed to explain the significance of the epidemic parameters. The existence and uniqueness of the solution to the proposed model have been proven using the fixed-point theorem and by helping the Arzela-Ascoli theorem. Using the predictor-corrector algorithm, we approximated the solution of the proposed model. The results obtained are represented by using figures that illustrate the behavior of the predicted model classes. Finally, the study of the stability of the numerical method is carried out using some results and primary lemmas.","1098":"In the test negative design, routine testing at healthcare facilities is leveraged to estimate the effectiveness of an intervention such as a vaccine. The odds of vaccination for individuals who test positive for a target pathogen is compared to the odds of vaccination for individuals who test negative for that pathogen, adjusting for key confounders. The design is rapidly growing in popularity, but many open questions remain about its properties. In this paper, we examine temporal confounding by generalizing derivations to allow for time-varying vaccine status, including out of season controls, and open populations. We confirm that calendar time is an important confounder when vaccine status varies during the study. We demonstrate that, where time is not a confounder, including out of season controls can improve precision. We generalize these results to open populations. We use our theoretical findings to interpret three recent papers utilizing the test negative design. Through careful examination of the theoretical properties of this study design, we provide key insights that can directly inform the implementation and analysis of future test negative studies.","1099":"Wastewater surveillance is considered as a powerful tool in providing cost-effective, population-wide and near real-time surveillance results for controlling infectious diseases (i.e., SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus), complementary to clinical surveillance. To facilitate the utility of this emerging tool, we developed two preanalytical protocols (supernatant-based and pellet-based) for influenza A\/B virus (IAV\/IBV) wastewater surveillance and applied them to the established wastewater surveillance network for large-scale longitudinal monitoring in Hong Kong. We tested 724 wastewater samples from 24 stationary sites for weekly surveillance for 8 months and 458 wastewater samples from 11 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for more frequent (three times per week) city-wide surveillance for 4 months when influenza season commenced. We found the city-wide IAV virus concentration in wastewater were associated with the detection rate and influenza-like illness plus rates (ILI+) of clinical respiratory specimens and increased significantly after the cancelling of mask mandate that was in place for COVID-19. IBV was at low detection rates and low virus concentration levels, consistent with the low detection rates observed by clinical surveillance. In addition, we conducted virus subtype identification in selected wastewater samples, and observed the H1pdm was the major circulation subtype. Moreover, the obtained virus signals were confirmed by Sanger sequencing of PCR products, suggesting the feasibility and applicability of established methods for rapid detection of influenza virus types and subtypes in wastewater surveillance. This study demonstrates the applicability of IAV\/IBV wastewater surveillance to current wastewater infrastructures and it could be used as a rapid and cost-effective surveillance strategy to track virus transmission patterns in the community for timely public health actions in the future.","1100":"We analyzed epidemic growth patterns at three different spatial scales (regional, national, and subnational) of the Ebola virus disease epidemic in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia by compiling publicly available weekly time series of reported EVD case numbers from the patient database available from the World Health Organization website for the period 05-Jan to 17-Dec 2014.The slower than expected growth pattern of local EVD outbreaks could result from a variety of factors, including behavior changes, success of control interventions, or intrinsic features of the disease such as a high level of clustering. Quantifying the contribution of each of these factors could help refine estimates of final epidemic size and the relative impact of different mitigation efforts in current and future EVD outbreaks.While many infectious disease epidemics are initially characterized by an exponential growth in time, we show that district-level Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks in West Africa follow slower polynomial-based growth kinetics over several generations of the disease.We found significant differences in the growth patterns of EVD cases at the scale of the country, district, and other subnational administrative divisions. The national cumulative curves of EVD cases in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia show periods of approximate exponential growth. In contrast, local epidemics are asynchronous and exhibit slow growth patterns during 3 or more EVD generations, which can be better approximated by a polynomial than an exponential function.","1101":"Assessing the factors responsible for differences in outbreak severity for the same pathogen is a challenging task, since outbreak data are often incomplete and may vary in type across outbreaks (e.g., daily case counts, serology, cases per household). We propose that outbreaks described with varied data types can be directly compared by using those data to estimate a common set of epidemiological parameters. To demonstrate this for chikungunya virus (CHIKV), we developed a realistic model of CHIKV transmission, along with a Bayesian inference method that accommodates any type of outbreak data that can be simulated. The inference method makes use of the fact that all data types arise from the same transmission process, which is simulated by the model. We applied these tools to data from three real-world outbreaks of CHIKV in Italy, Cambodia, and Bangladesh to estimate nine model parameters. We found that these populations differed in several parameters, including pre-existing immunity and house-to-house differences in mosquito activity. These differences resulted in posterior predictions of local CHIKV transmission risk that varied nearly fourfold: 16% in Italy, 28% in Cambodia, and 62% in Bangladesh. Our inference method and model can be applied to improve understanding of the epidemiology of CHIKV and other pathogens for which outbreaks are described with varied data types.","1102":"This study addressed the impact on mental health and wellbeing in relation to views of the self, the world, and the future during the early stage of the global novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak. An online survey battery included the 21-item Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Subjective Happiness Scale, Self-Compassion Scale, Adult Hope Scale, and two specifically-written items measuring the valence quality and quantity of the impact of the pandemic. A total of 345 Hong Kong residents (54% females) responded; 17.1%, 24.7%, and 19.7% reported elevated levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. The prevalence of these issues was lower in this Hong Kong sample than reported in other COVID-19 studies, possibly due to the past experience of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong in promoting the voluntary wearing of masks in public places and introducing social distancing measures during the early first wave of the pandemic. Correlational analyses showed associations between positive views about the self (higher self-compassion), the world (higher positive valence), and the future (more hope) and better mental health and psychological wellbeing (fewer depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms; more happiness). Regression analyses indicated a differential predicting power of the three views on the four selected mental health and psychological wellbeing indicators. Intervention programs to alleviate distress and\/or promote better wellbeing should be matched to the specific problems encountered by the sufferers.","1103":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) may indicate actively replicating virus, but sgRNA abundance has not been systematically compared between SARS-CoV-2 variants. sgRNA was quantified in 169 clinical samples by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, demonstrating similar relative abundance among known variants. Thus, sgRNA detection can identify individuals with active viral replication regardless of variant.","1104":" pulmonary dosimetry.","1105":"Predicting how increasing intensity of human-environment interactions affects pathogen transmission is essential to anticipate changing disease risks and identify appropriate mitigation strategies. Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are highly responsive to environmental changes, but such responses are notoriously difficult to isolate because pathogen transmission depends on a suite of ecological and social responses in vectors and hosts that may differ across species. Here we use the emerging tools of cumulative pressure mapping and machine learning to better understand how the occurrence of six medically important VBDs, differing in ecology from sylvatic to urban, respond to multidimensional effects of human pressure. We find that not only is human footprint-an index of human pressure, incorporating built environments, energy and transportation infrastructure, agricultural lands and human population density-an important predictor of VBD occurrence, but there are clear thresholds governing the occurrence of different VBDs. Across a spectrum of human pressure, diseases associated with lower human pressure, including malaria, cutaneous leishmaniasis and visceral leishmaniasis, give way to diseases associated with high human pressure, such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. These heterogeneous responses of VBDs to human pressure highlight thresholds of land-use transitions that may lead to abrupt shifts in infectious disease burdens and public health needs.","1106":"The reduction of genetic diversity due to genetic hitchhiking is widely used to find past selective sweeps from sequencing data, but very little is known about how spatial structure affects hitchhiking. We use mathematical modeling and simulations to find the unfolded site frequency spectrum (SFS) left by hitchhiking in the genomic region of a sweep in a population occupying a one-dimensional range. For such populations, sweeps spread as Fisher waves, rather than logistically. We find that this leaves a characteristic three-part SFS at loci very close to the swept locus. Very low frequencies are dominated by recent mutations that occurred after the sweep and are unaffected by hitchhiking. At moderately low frequencies, there is a transition zone primarily composed of alleles that briefly \"surfed\" on the wave of the sweep before falling out of the wavefront, leaving a spectrum close to that expected in well-mixed populations. However, for moderate-to-high frequencies, there is a distinctive scaling regime of the SFS produced by alleles that drifted to fixation in the wavefront and then were carried throughout the population. For loci slightly farther away from the swept locus on the genome, recombination is much more effective at restoring diversity in one-dimensional populations than it is in well-mixed ones. We find that these signatures of space can be strong even in apparently well-mixed populations with negligible spatial genetic differentiation, suggesting that spatial structure may frequently distort the signatures of hitchhiking in natural populations.","1107":"Consumer wearables and sensors are a rich source of data about patients' daily disease and symptom burden, particularly in the case of movement disorders like Parkinson's disease (PD). However, interpreting these complex data into so-called digital biomarkers requires complicated analytical approaches, and validating these biomarkers requires sufficient data and unbiased evaluation methods. Here we describe the use of crowdsourcing to specifically evaluate and benchmark features derived from accelerometer and gyroscope data in two different datasets to predict the presence of PD and severity of three PD symptoms: tremor, dyskinesia, and bradykinesia. Forty teams from around the world submitted features, and achieved drastically improved predictive performance for PD status (best AUROC\u2009=\u20090.87), as well as tremor- (best AUPR\u2009=\u20090.75), dyskinesia- (best AUPR\u2009=\u20090.48) and bradykinesia-severity (best AUPR\u2009=\u20090.95).","1108":"WGS is a useful tool for understanding SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in professional sports teams.In the fall of 2021, all 30 players from 1 MLS team underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing per protocol; 27 (90%) were vaccinated. One player who had recently traveled to Africa tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; within the following 2 weeks, 10 additional players and 1 staff member tested positive. WGS yielded full genome sequences for 10 samples, including 1 from the traveler. The traveler's sample was Delta sublineage AY.36 and was closely related to a sequence from Africa. Nine samples yielded other Delta sublineages including AY.4 (n = 7), AY.39 (n = 1), and B.1.617.2 (n = 1). The 7 AY.4 sequences clustered together; suggesting a common source of infection. Transmission from a family member visiting from England to an MLS player was identified as the potential index case. The other 2 AY.4 sequences differed from this group by 1-3 nucleotides, as did a partial genome sequence from an additional team member.Professional soccer athletes are at risk of acquiring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). United States Major League Soccer (MLS) uses protocol-based SARS-CoV-2 testing for identification of individuals with coronavirus disease 2019.Per MLS protocol, fully vaccinated players underwent SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction testing weekly; unvaccinated players were tested every other day.

Given the elusive nature of the disease, a systematic approach to identify efficient interventions would be useful for policymakers in addressing LD. We used Markov modeling to investigate the efficiency of interventions. These interventions range from awareness-based to behavioral-based strategies. Targeting animal reservoirs of LD using fungal spray or bait boxes did not prove to be an effective intervention. Results of awareness-based interventions, including distribution of signage, fliers, and presentations, implementable in different geographical scales, suggest that policymakers should focus on these interventions, as they are both cost-effective and have the highest impact on lowering LD risk. Populations may lose focus of LD warnings over time, thus quick succession of these interventions is vital. Our modeling results identify the awareness-based intervention as the most cost-effective strategy to lower the number of LD cases. These results can aid in the establishment of effective LD risk reduction policy at various scales of implementation.","1111":"Human agency has been a focus of philosophical and sociological concern from early debates about \"free will\" to recent themes in poststructuralism. Debates over the proper understanding of structure, agency, and constraint are hindered by the fact that few if any empirical measures of these concepts have been proposed. As sociologists have long recognized, the total results of the decisions of a group's members can be viewed as a distribution, and parameters can be fit to obtain a description of observed distributions. Here we propose the use of negative binomial curve to model population survival outcomes, and suggest that the parameters of such a curve represent reasonable surrogates for measures of agency, opportunity, and constraint when the decision process can be thought of as akin to a Bernoulli process. To provide an illustration of this approach, we discuss participation of legal minors in commercial sex (commonly referred to as victims of domestic minor sex trafficking (VDMST) or commercially sexually exploited children (CSEC)). In popular and advocacy-based accounts, considerable focus has been placed on the relative powerlessness of female VDMST. Using the proposed modeling technique, we test the extent to which male versus female VDMST appear to possess greater agency (or function under more limiting constraint) when deciding whether to remain in sex work or \"leave the life\". Contrary to existing literature, our results indicate that male and female underage sex workers are experiencing similar levels of agency, and differ mainly in opportunity, and constraint. Other individual circumstances are shown to contribute to varying levels of agency and constraint among sex workers, including street work status, community trouble, drug use, and the availability of an alternative income.","1112":"The recurrent multiwave nature of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) necessitates updating its symptomatology. We characterize the effect of variants on symptom presentation, identify the symptoms predictive and protective of death, and quantify the effect of vaccination on symptom development. With the COVID-19 cases reported up to August\u00a025, 2022 in Hong Kong, an iterative multitier text-matching algorithm was developed to identify symptoms from free text. Multivariate regression was used to measure associations between variants, symptom development, death, and vaccination status. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator technique was used to identify a parsimonious set of symptoms jointly associated with death. Overall, 70.9% (54\u2009450\/76\u2009762) of cases were symptomatic with 102 symptoms identified. Intrinsically, the wild-type and delta variant caused similar symptoms among unvaccinated symptomatic cases, whereas the wild-type and omicron BA.2 subvariant had heterogeneous patterns, with seven symptoms (fatigue, fever, chest pain, runny nose, sputum production, nausea\/vomiting, and sore throat) more frequent in the BA.2 cohort. With \u22652 vaccine doses, BA.2 was more likely than delta to cause fever among symptomatic cases. Fever, blocked nose, pneumonia, and shortness of breath remained jointly predictive of death among unvaccinated symptomatic elderly in the wild-type-to-omicron transition. Number of vaccine doses required for reducing occurrence varied by symptoms. We substantiate that omicron has a different clinical presentation compared to previous variants. Syndromic surveillance can be bettered with reduced reliance on symptom-based case identification, increased weighing on symptoms predictive of death in outcome prediction, individual-based risk assessment in care homes, and incorporating free-text symptom reporting.","1113":"Personal protection (PP) techniques, such as insecticide-treated nets, repellents and medications, include some of the most important and commonest ways used today to protect individuals from vector-borne infectious diseases. In this study, we explore the possibility that a PP intervention with partial coverage may have the counterintuitive effect of increasing disease burden at the population level, by increasing the biting intensity on the unprotected portion of the population. To this end, we have developed a dynamic model which incorporates parameters that describe the potential effects of PP on vector searching and biting behaviour and calculated its basic reproductive rate, R0. R0 is a well-established threshold of disease risk; the higher R0 is above unity, the stronger the disease onset intensity. When R0 is below unity, the disease is typically unable to persist. The model analysis revealed that partial coverage with popular PP techniques can realistically lead to a substantial increase in the reproductive number. An increase in R0 implies an increase in disease burden and difficulties in eradication efforts within certain parameter regimes. Our findings therefore stress the importance of studying vector behavioural patterns in response to PP interventions for future mitigation of vector-borne diseases.

To inform policy on the introduction of the EV-A71 vaccine into the National Immunization Programme, we investigated the seroepidemiological characteristics of EV-A71 in two prospective cohorts of children in southern China conducted between 2013 and 2018. Our results show that maternal antibody titres declined rapidly in neonates, with over half becoming susceptible to EV-A71 at 1 month of age. Between 6 months and 2 years of age, over 80% of study participants were susceptible, while one third remained susceptible at 5 years old. The highest incidence of EV-A71 infections was observed in children aged 5-6 months. Our findings support EV-A71 vaccination before 6 months for birth cohorts in southern China, potentially with a one-time catch-up vaccination for children 6 months-5 years old. More regionally representative longitudinal seroepidemiological studies are needed to further validate these findings.","1115":"Our findings support ACIP recommendations for annual influenza vaccination. Benefits of current season vaccination varied among participants with and without prior season vaccination, by virus type\/subtype and season.We compared effects of prior vaccination and added or lost protection from current season vaccination among those previously vaccinated.Our analysis included data from the US Flu VE Network among participants \u22659 years old with acute respiratory illness from 2012-13 through 2017-18. Vaccine protection was estimated using multivariate logistic regression with an interaction term for effect of prior season vaccination on current season vaccine effectiveness. Models were adjusted for age, calendar time, high-risk status, site, and season for combined estimates. We estimated protection by combinations of current and prior vaccination compared to unvaccinated in both seasons or current vaccination compared to prior vaccinated.31,819 participants were included. Vaccine protection against any influenza averaged 42% (38 to 47) among those vaccinated only the current season, 37% (33 to 40) among those vaccinated both seasons, and 26% (18 to 32) among those vaccinated only the prior season, compared to participants vaccinated neither season. Current season vaccination reduced the odds of any influenza among patients unvaccinated the prior season by 42% (37 to 46), including 57%, 27% and 55% against A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and influenza B, respectively. Among participants vaccinated the prior season, current season vaccination further reduced the odds of any influenza by 15% (7 to 23), including 29% against A(H1N1) and 26% against B viruses, but not against A(H3N2).","1116":"Using the itinerary and epidemiological data of COVID-19 cases and close contacts on domestic airplanes departing from Wuhan city in China before the lockdown on January 23, 2020, we estimated the upper and lower bounds of overall transmission risk of COVID-19 among travellers.The ARs among travellers varied by seat distance from the index case and joint travel time, but the variation was not significant between the types of aircraft. The overall risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during domestic travel on planes was relatively low. These findings can improve our understanding of COVID-19 spread during travel and inform response efforts in the pandemic.Modern transportation plays a key role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and new variants. However, little is known about the exact transmission risk of the virus on airplanes.175 index cases were identified among 5797 passengers on 177 airplanes. The upper and lower attack rates (ARs) of a seat were 0.60% (34\/5622, 95%CI 0.43%-0.84%) and 0.33% (18\/5400, 95%CI 0.21%-0.53%), respectively. In the upper- and lower-bound risk estimates, each index case infected 0.19 (SD 0.45) and 0.10 (SD 0.32) cases respectively. The seats immediately adjacent to the index cases had an AR of 9.2% (95%CI 5.7%-14.4%), with a relative risk 27.8 (95%CI 14.4-53.7) compared to other seats in the upper limit estimation. The middle seat had the highest AR (0.7%, 95%CI 0.4%-1.2%). The upper-bound AR increased from 0.7% (95%CI 0.5%-1.0%) to 1.2% (95%CI 0.4%-3.3%) when the co-travel time increased from 2.0 hours to 3.3 hours.","1117":"Typhoid fever is an acute systemic infectious disease responsible for an estimated 12-20 million illnesses and over 150\u2008000 deaths annually. In March, 2018, a new recommendation was issued by WHO for the programmatic use of typhoid conjugate vaccines in endemic countries. Health economic analyses of typhoid vaccines have informed funding decisions and national policies regarding vaccine rollout. However, by focusing only on averted typhoid cases and their associated costs, traditional cost-effectiveness analyses might underestimate crucial benefits of typhoid vaccination programmes, because the potential effect of typhoid vaccines on the treatment of patients with non-specific acute febrile illnesses is not considered. For every true case of typhoid fever, three to 25 patients without typhoid disease are treated with antimicrobials unnecessarily, conservatively amounting to more than 50 million prescriptions per year. Antimicrobials for suspected typhoid might therefore be an important selective pressure for the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance globally. We propose that large-scale, more aggressive typhoid vaccination programmes-including catch-up campaigns in children up to 15 years of age, and vaccination in lower incidence settings-have the potential to reduce the overuse of antimicrobials and thereby reduce antimicrobial resistance in many bacterial pathogens. Funding bodies and national governments must therefore consider the potential for broad reductions in antimicrobial use and resistance in decisions related to the rollout of typhoid conjugate vaccines.","1118":"We estimate the potential impact of COVID-19 on the United Kingdom economy, including direct disease effects, preventive public actions and associated policies. A sectoral, whole-economy macroeconomic model was linked to a population-wide epidemiological demographic model to assess the potential macroeconomic impact of COVID-19, together with policies to mitigate or suppress the pandemic by means of home quarantine, school closures, social distancing and accompanying business closures. Our simulations indicate that, assuming a clinical attack rate of 48% and a case fatality ratio of 1.5%, COVID-19 alone would impose a direct health-related economic burden of \u00a339.6bn (1.73% of GDP) on the UK economy. Mitigation strategies imposed for 12 weeks reduce case fatalities by 29%, but the total cost to the economy is \u00a3308bn (13.5% of GDP); \u00a366bn (2.9% of GDP) of which is attributable to labour lost from working parents during school closures, and \u00a3201bn (8.8% of GDP) of which is attributable to business closures. Suppressing the pandemic over a longer period of time may reduce deaths by 95%, but the total cost to the UK economy also increases to \u00a3668bn (29.2% of GDP), where \u00a3166bn (7.3% of GDP) is attributable to school closures and 502bn (21.9% of GDP) to business closures. Our analyses suggest Covid-19 has the potential to impose unprecedented economic costs on the UK economy, and whilst public actions are necessary to minimise mortality, the duration of school and business closures are key to determining the economic cost. The initial economic support package promised by the UK government may be proportionate to the costs of mitigating Covid-19, but without alternative measures to reduce the scale and duration of school and business closures, the economic support may be insufficient to compensate for longer term suppression of the pandemic which could generate an even greater health impact through major recession.","1119":"The patient records were retrospectively analyzed for whom a polysomnography was conducted at our sleep. Sex, age, Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), waist circumference, height, and BMI values of those patients were recorded. AHI scores were used to classify severity of OSAS.A high value of waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, and BMI is associated with the presence and severity of OSAS. We have determined the cutoff values of the studied anthropometric measurements in both sexes for OSAS and severe OSAS.The study included 437 OSAS patients and 72 control cases. Out of the patient group, OSAS was severe in 208 (47%) patients, moderate in 124 (28%), and mild in 105 (24%) of them. In the group of OSAS patients, waist-to-height ratio, waist circumference, and BMI were higher compared to the control group with a further difference of all three parameters among severe, moderate, mild OSAS, and controls both in males and females. Cutoff values for OSAS of females were 95.5\u00a0cm for waist circumference, 0.595 for waist-to-height ratio, and 27.75 for BMI whereas the cutoff values of males were 100.5\u00a0cm, 0.575, and 27.75, respectively.Obesity is among the known risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). In this study, our aim was to investigate the correlation of waist-to-height ratio, an indicator of central obesity, with presence and severity of OSAS; to compare the use of this ratio with the use of waist circumference and body mass index (BMI); and to determine OSAS-related cutoff values.","1120":"Our understanding of cholera transmission and burden largely rely on clinic-based surveillance, which can obscure trends, bias burden estimates and limit the impact of targeted cholera-prevention measures. Serologic surveillance provides a complementary approach to monitoring infections, though the link between serologically-derived infections and medically-attended disease - shaped by immunological, behavioral, and clinical factors - remains poorly understood. We unravel this cascade in a cholera-endemic Bangladeshi community by integrating clinic-based surveillance, healthcare seeking, and longitudinal serological data through statistical modeling. We found >50% of the study population had a V. cholerae O1 infection annually, and infection timing was not consistently correlated with reported cases. Four in 2,340 infections resulted in symptoms, only one of which was reported through the surveillance system. These results provide new insights into cholera transmission dynamics and burden in the epicenter of the 7th cholera pandemic and provide a framework to synthesize serological and clinical surveillance data.","1121":"Patients with obesity were more likely to have poor outcomes even without increased inflammation.Patients with Covid-19 and obesity have worse clinical outcomes which may be driven by increased inflammation. This study aimed to characterize the association between clinical outcomes in patients with obesity and inflammatory markers.Of 791 patients with Covid-19, 361 (45.6%) had obesity. In multivariate analyses, BMI \u226535 was associated with a higher odds of ICU transfer (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.388 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.074-5.310) and hospital mortality (aOR = 4.3, 95% CI: 1.69-10.82). Compared to those with BMI<30, patients with obesity had lower ferritin (444 vs 637 ng\/mL; p<0.001) and lower D-dimer (293 vs 350 mcg\/mL; p = 0.009), non-significant differences in CRP (72.8 vs 84.1 mg\/L, p = 0.099), and higher LDH (375 vs 340, p = 0.009) on the first hospital day.We analyzed data for patients aged \u226518 years admitted with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. We used multivariate logistic regression to determine the association between BMI and intensive care unit (ICU) transfer and all-cause mortality. Inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], ferritin, and D-dimer) were compared between patients with and without obesity (body mass index [BMI] \u226530 kg\/m2).","1122":"United States kindergarten measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination rates are typically reported at the state level by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The lack of local MMR data prevents identification of areas with low vaccination rates that would be vulnerable to the spread of disease. We collected county-level vaccination rates for the 2014-2015 school year with the objective of identifying these regions. We requested county-level kindergarten vaccination data from state health departments, and mapped these data to visualize geographic patterns in achievement of the 95% MMR vaccination target. We aggregated the county-level data to the state level for comparison against CDC state estimates. We also analyzed the relationship of MMR vaccination level with county-level and state-level poverty (using U.S. census data), using both a national mixed model with state as a random effect, and individual linear regression models by state. We received county vaccination data from 43 states. The median kindergarten MMR vaccination rate was 96.0% (IQR 89-98) across all counties, however, we estimated that 48.4% of the represented counties had vaccination rates below 95%. Our state estimates closely reflected CDC values. Nationally, every 10% increase in under-18 county poverty was associated with a 0.24% increase in MMR vaccination rates (95% CI: -0.07%; 0.54%), but the direction of this relationship varied by state. We found that county data can reveal vaccination trends that are unobservable from state-level data, but we also discovered that the current availability of county-level data is inadequate. Our findings can be used by state health departments to identify target areas for vaccination programs.","1123":"Photosynthesis fuels primary production at the base of marine food webs. Yet, in many surface ocean ecosystems, diel-driven primary production is tightly coupled to daily loss. This tight coupling raises the question: which top-down drivers predominate in maintaining persistently stable picocyanobacterial populations over longer time scales? Motivated by high-frequency surface water measurements taken in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG), we developed multitrophic models to investigate bottom-up and top-down mechanisms underlying the balanced control of Prochlorococcus populations. We find that incorporating photosynthetic growth with viral- and predator-induced mortality is sufficient to recapitulate daily oscillations of Prochlorococcus abundances with baseline community abundances. In doing so, we infer that grazers in this environment function as the predominant top-down factor despite high standing viral particle densities. The model-data fits also reveal the ecological relevance of light-dependent viral traits and non-canonical factors to cellular loss. Finally, we leverage sensitivity analyses to demonstrate how variation in life history traits across distinct oceanic contexts, including variation in viral adsorption and grazer clearance rates, can transform the quantitative and even qualitative importance of top-down controls in shaping Prochlorococcus population dynamics.","1124":"Drug resistance is a long-standing economic, veterinary and human health concern in human and animal populations. Efficacy of prophylactic drug treatments targeting a particular pathogen is often short-lived, as drug-resistant pathogens evolve and reach high frequency in a treated population. Methods to combat drug resistance are usually costly, including use of multiple drugs that are applied jointly or sequentially, or development of novel classes of drugs. Alternatively, there is growing interest in exploiting untreated host populations, refugia, for the management of drug resistance. Refugia do not experience selection for resistance, and serve as a reservoir for native, drug-susceptible pathogens. The force of infection from refugia may dilute the frequency of resistant pathogens in the treated population, potentially at an acceptable cost in terms of overall disease burden. We examine this concept using a simple mathematical model that captures the core mechanisms of transmission and selection common to many host-pathogen systems. We identify the roles of selection and gene flow in determining the utility of refugia. ","1125":"A total of 30,647 cases were reported of whom household RCD was completed for 21,443 (63%) index case households and 85,318 household members tested for malaria. The findings show that younger age (p-value for trend [Ptrend]\u2009<\u20090.001), history of fever in the last 2 weeks (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u200935.7; 95% CI 32.3-39.5), travel outside Zanzibar in the last 30 days (OR\u2009=\u20092.5; 95% CI 2.3-2.8) and living in Unguja (OR\u2009=\u20091.2; 95% CI 1.0-1.5) were independently associated with increased odds of RDT positivity. In contrast, male gender (OR=0.8; 95% CI 0.7-0.9), sleeping under an LLIN the previous night (OR\u2009=\u20090.9; 95% CI 0.7-0.9), having higher household net access (Ptrend\u2009<\u20090.001), and living in a household that received IRS in the last 12 months (OR\u2009=\u20090.8; 95% CI 0.7-0.9) were independently associated with reduced odds of RDT positivity. A significant effect modification of combining IRS and LLIN was also noted (OR\u2009=\u20090.7; 95% CI 0.6-0.8).Over the past two decades, Zanzibar substantially reduced malaria burden. As malaria decreases, sustainable improvements in control interventions may increasingly depend on accurate knowledge of malaria risk factors to further target interventions. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors associated with malaria infection in Zanzibar.Surveillance data from Zanzibar's Malaria Case Notification system from August 2012 and December 2019 were analyzed. This system collects data on malaria cases passively detected and reported by all health facilities (index cases), and household-based reactive case detection (RCD) activities linked to those primary cases. All members of households of the index cases were screened for malaria using a malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Individuals with a positive RDT were treated with artemisinin-based combination therapy. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were done to investigate the association between RDT positivity among the household members and explanatory factors with adjustment for seasonality and clustering at Shehia level.The findings suggest that vector control remains an important malaria prevention intervention: they underscore the need to maintain universal access to LLINs, the persistent promotion of LLIN use, and application of IRS. Additionally, enhanced behavioural change and preventive strategies targeting children aged 5-14 years and travellers are needed.","1126":"With the rapidly increasing abundance and accessibility of genomic data, there is a growing interest in using population genetic approaches to characterize fine-scale dispersal of organisms, providing insight into biological processes across a broad range of fields including ecology, evolution and epidemiology. For sexually recombining haploid organisms such as the human malaria parasite P. falciparum, however, there have been no systematic assessments of the type of data and methods required to resolve fine scale connectivity. This analytical gap hinders the use of genomics for understanding local transmission patterns, a crucial goal for policy makers charged with eliminating this important human pathogen. Here we use data collected from four clinics with a catchment area spanning approximately 120 km of the Thai-Myanmar border to compare the ability of divergence (FST) and relatedness based on identity by descent (IBD) to resolve spatial connectivity between malaria parasites collected from proximal clinics. We found no relationship between inter-clinic distance and FST, likely due to sampling of highly related parasites within clinics, but a significant decline in IBD-based relatedness with increasing inter-clinic distance. This association was contingent upon the data set type and size. We estimated that approximately 147 single-infection whole genome sequenced parasite samples or 222 single-infection parasite samples genotyped at 93 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were sufficient to recover a robust spatial trend estimate at this scale. In summary, surveillance efforts cannot rely on classical measures of genetic divergence to measure P. falciparum transmission on a local scale. Given adequate sampling, IBD-based relatedness provides a useful alternative, and robust trends can be obtained from parasite samples genotyped at approximately 100 SNPs.","1127":"A prophylactic vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a top priority in biomedical research. Given the failure of conventional immunization protocols to confer robust protection against HIV, new and unconventional approaches may be needed to generate protective anti-HIV immunity. Here we vaccinated rhesus macaques (RMs) with a recombinant (r)DNA prime (without any exogenous adjuvant), followed by a booster with rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (RRV)-a herpesvirus that establishes persistent infection in RMs (Group 1). Both the rDNA and rRRV vectors encoded a near-full-length simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVnfl) genome that assembles noninfectious SIV particles and expresses all nine SIV gene products. This rDNA\/rRRV-SIVnfl vaccine regimen induced persistent anti-Env antibodies and CD8+ T-cell responses against the entire SIV proteome. Vaccine efficacy was assessed by repeated, marginal-dose, intrarectal challenges with SIVmac239. Encouragingly, vaccinees in Group 1 acquired SIVmac239 infection at a significantly delayed rate compared to unvaccinated controls (Group 3). In an attempt to improve upon this outcome, a separate group of rDNA\/rRRV-SIVnfl-vaccinated RMs (Group 2) was treated with a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4)-blocking monoclonal antibody during the vaccine phase and then challenged in parallel with Groups 1 and 3. Surprisingly, Group 2 was not significantly protected against SIVmac239 infection. In sum, SIVnfl vaccination can protect RMs against rigorous mucosal challenges with SIVmac239, a feat that until now had only been accomplished by live-attenuated strains of SIV. Further work is needed to identify the minimal requirements for this protection and whether SIVnfl vaccine efficacy can be improved by means other than anti-CTLA-4 adjuvant therapy.","1128":"Anthropogenic activities expose many ecosystems to multiple novel disturbances simultaneously. Despite this, how biodiversity responds to simultaneous disturbances remains unclear, with conflicting empirical results on their interactive effects. Here, we experimentally test how one disturbance (an invasive species) affects the diversity of a community over multiple levels of another disturbance regime (pulse mortality). Specifically, we invade stably coexisting bacterial communities under four different pulse frequencies, and compare their final resident diversity to uninvaded communities under the same pulse mortality regimes. Our experiment shows that the disturbances synergistically interact, such that the invader significantly reduces resident diversity at high pulse frequency, but not at low. This work therefore highlights the need to study simultaneous disturbance effects over multiple disturbance regimes as well as to carefully document unmanipulated disturbances, and may help explain the conflicting results seen in previous multiple-disturbance work.","1129":"Zanzibar has made significant progress toward malaria elimination, but recent stagnation requires novel approaches. We developed a highly multiplexed droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)-based amplicon sequencing method targeting 35 microhaplotypes and drug-resistance loci, and successfully sequenced 290 samples from five districts covering both main islands. Here, we elucidate fine-scale Plasmodium falciparum population structure and infer relatedness and connectivity of infections using an identity-by-descent (IBD) approach. Despite high genetic diversity, we observe pronounced fine-scale spatial and temporal parasite genetic structure. Clusters of near-clonal infections on Pemba indicate persistent local transmission with limited parasite importation, presenting an opportunity for local elimination efforts. Furthermore, we observe an admixed parasite population on Unguja and detect a substantial fraction (2.9%) of significantly related infection pairs between Zanzibar and the mainland, suggesting recent importation. Our study provides a high-resolution view of parasite genetic structure across the Zanzibar archipelago and provides actionable insights for prioritizing malaria elimination efforts.","1130":"We included studies that were primarily designed to estimate the quantitative impact of one or more implemented COVID-19 policies on direct SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 outcomes. After searching PubMed for peer-reviewed articles published on November 26 or earlier and screening, all studies were reviewed by three reviewers independently and in consensus. The review tool was based on review guidance for assessing COVID-19 health policy impact evaluation analyses, including first identifying the assumptions behind the methods used, followed by assessing graphical display of outcomes data, functional form for the outcomes, timing between policy and impact, concurrent changes to the outcomes, and an overall rating.After 102 articles were identified as potentially meeting inclusion criteria, we identified 36 published articles that evaluated the quantitative impact of COVID-19 policies on direct COVID-19 outcomes. The majority (n=23\/36) of studies in our sample examined the impact of stay-at-home requirements. Nine studies were set aside due to inappropriate study design (n=8 pre\/post; n=1 cross-section), and 27 articles were given a full consensus assessment. 20\/27 met criteria for graphical display of data, 5\/27 for functional form, 19\/27 for timing between policy implementation and impact, and only 3\/27 for concurrent changes to the outcomes. Only 1\/27 studies passed all of the above checks, and 4\/27 were rated as overall appropriate. Including the 9 studies set aside, we found that only four (or by a stricter standard, only one) of the 36 identified published and peer-reviewed health policy impact evaluation studies passed a set of key design checks for identifying the causal impact of policies on COVID-19 outcomes.The current literature directly evaluating the impact of COVID-19 policies largely fails to meet key design criteria for useful inference. This may be partially due to the circumstances for evaluation being particularly difficult, as well as a context with desire for rapid publication, the importance of the topic, and weak peer review processes. Importantly, weak evidence is non-informative and does not indicate how effective these policies were on COVID-19 outcomes.The impact of policies on COVID-19 outcomes is one of the most important questions of our time. Unfortunately, there are substantial concerns about the strength and quality of the literature examining policy impacts. This study systematically assessed the currently published COVID-19 policy impact literature for a checklist of study design elements and methodological issues.","1131":" PET\/MRI neuroimaging revealed regional alterations in glycolytic metabolism and vascular perfusion. Transcriptional profiling by RNA-Seq of brain hemispheres identified sex and age as the main sources of variation between genotypes including age-specific enrichment of AD-related processes. Similarly, age was the strongest determinant of behavioral change. In the absence of mouse amyloid plaque formation, many of the hallmarks of AD were not observed in this strain. However, as a sensitized baseline model with many additional alleles and environmental modifications already appended, the dataset from this initial MODEL-AD strain serves an important role in establishing the individual effects and interaction between two strong genetic risk factors for LOAD in a mouse host.","1132":"Limited data exist on the impact of maternal Tetanus, Diphtheria, acellular Pertussis (aP) (Tdap) vaccination for preterm born infants. We report its effect at birth and on antibody-mediated immune responses to a DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP~T vaccine in preterm compared to term infants.Women delivering at term or prematurely were either vaccinated with a Tdap vaccine (Boostrix\u00ae, GSK) during pregnancy or not vaccinated in the last 5 years. Cord and maternal blood were collected at delivery. Infants were vaccinated with DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP~T vaccine (Hexyon\u00ae, Sanofi Pasteur) and bled before and one month after primary (8-12-16 weeks) and before and one month after booster vaccination (13 or 15 months for preterm and term respectively). Immunoglobulin G antibodies against all antigens included in DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP~T vaccine were measured (NCT02511327).Cord blood Geometric Mean Concentrations (GMCs) in preterm infants from Tdap-vaccinated women were significantly higher than in term and preterm infants from unvaccinated women. A longer time interval between maternal vaccination and delivery resulted in higher cord blood GMCs in preterm infants. Equal GMCs in term and preterm infants from Tdap-vaccinated women were observed after primary vaccination. After boosting, significantly lower GMCs were seen for PT, FHA and TT in preterm compared to term infants from Tdap-vaccinated women, yet still comparable to GMCs in both term and preterm infants from unvaccinated women.Preterm infants profit from maternal Tdap vaccination. Prematurity did not influence primary immune responses in the presence of maternal antibodies, but was associated with a lower booster immune response.","1133":"We used an age-structured compartmental dynamic model, the Dynamic Measles Immunization Calculation Engine (DynaMICE), to assess the effects of different vaccination strategies on measles susceptibility and burden during 2000-20 in 14 countries with high measles incidence (containing 53% of the global birth cohort and 78% of the global measles burden). Country-specific routine MCV1 and MCV2 coverage data during 1980-2020 were obtained from the WHO and UNICEF Estimates of National Immunization Coverage database for all modelled countries and SIA data were obtained from the WHO summary of measles and rubella SIAs. We estimated the incremental health effects of different vaccination strategies using prevented cases of measles and deaths from measles and their efficiency using the incremental number needed to vaccinate (NNV) to prevent an additional measles case.Vaccination strategies, including non-selective SIAs, reach a greater proportion of children who are unvaccinated and reduce measles burden more than MCV2 alone, but efficiency is lower because of the wide age range targeted by SIAs. This analysis provides information to help improve the health effects and efficiency of measles vaccination strategies. The interplay between MCV1, MCV2, and SIAs should be considered when planning future measles vaccination strategies.Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.Compared with no vaccination, MCV1 implementation was estimated to have prevented 824 million cases of measles and 9\u00b76 million deaths from measles, with a median NNV of 1\u00b741 (IQR 1\u00b735-1\u00b744). Adding routine MCV2 to MCV1 was estimated to have prevented 108 million cases and 404\u2008270 deaths, whereas adding SIAs to MCV1 was estimated to have prevented 256 million cases and 4\u00b74 million deaths. Despite larger incremental effects, adding SIAs to MCV1 (median incremental NNV 6\u00b702, 5\u00b730-7\u00b768) showed reduced efficiency compared with adding routine MCV2 (5\u00b741, 4\u00b776-6\u00b711).WHO recommends at least 95% population coverage with two doses of measles-containing vaccine (MCV). Most countries worldwide use routine services to offer a first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) and later, a second dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV2). Many countries worldwide conduct supplementary immunisation activities (SIAs), offering vaccination to all people in a specific age range irrespective of previous vaccination history. We aimed to estimate the relative effects of each dose and delivery route in 14 countries with high measles burden.","1134":"Geosocial-networking smartphone applications are commonly used by gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) to meet sexual partners. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate awareness of and willingness to use pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among MSM who use geosocial-networking smartphone applications residing in New York City. Recruitment utilizing broadcast advertisements on a popular smartphone application for MSM yielded a sample of 152 HIV-uninfected MSM. Multivariable models were used to assess demographic and behavioral correlates of awareness of and willingness to use PrEP. Most participants (85.5\u00a0%) had heard about PrEP but few (9.2\u00a0%) reported current use. Unwillingness to use PrEP was associated with concerns about side effects (PR\u00a0=\u00a00.303; 95\u00a0% CI 0.130, 0.708; p\u00a0=\u00a00.006). Given that more than half (57.6\u00a0%) of participants were willing to use PrEP, future research is needed to elucidate both individual and structural barriers to PrEP use among MSM.","1135":"The use of social contact rates is widespread in infectious disease modeling since it has been shown that they are key driving forces of important epidemiological parameters. Quantification of contact patterns is crucial to parameterize dynamic transmission models and to provide insights on the (basic) reproduction number. Information on social interactions can be obtained from population-based contact surveys, such as the European Commission project POLYMOD. Estimation of age-specific contact rates from these studies is often done using a piecewise constant approach or bivariate smoothing techniques. For the latter, typically, smoothness is introduced in the dimensions of the respondent's and contact's age (i.e., the rows and columns of the social contact matrix). We propose a smoothing constrained approach-taking into account the reciprocal nature of contacts-introducing smoothness over the diagonal (including all subdiagonals) of the social contact matrix. This modeling approach is justified assuming that when people age their contact behavior changes smoothly. We call this smoothing from a cohort perspective. Two approaches that allow for smoothing over social contact matrix diagonals are proposed, namely (i) reordering of the diagonal components of the contact matrix and (ii) reordering of the penalty matrix ensuring smoothness over the contact matrix diagonals. Parameter estimation is done in the likelihood framework by using constrained penalized iterative reweighted least squares. A simulation study underlines the benefits of cohort-based smoothing. Finally, the proposed methods are illustrated on the Belgian POLYMOD data of 2006. Code to reproduce the results of the article can be downloaded on this GitHub repository https:\/\/github.com\/oswaldogressani\/Cohort_smoothing.","1136":"Although measles incidence has reached historic lows in many parts of the world, the disease still causes substantial morbidity globally. Even where control programs have succeeded in driving measles locally extinct, unless vaccination coverage is maintained at extremely high levels, susceptible numbers may increase sufficiently to spark large outbreaks. Human mobility will drive potentially infectious contacts and interact with the landscape of susceptibility to determine the pattern of measles outbreaks. These interactions have proved difficult to characterise empirically. We explore the degree to which new sources of data combined with existing public health data can be used to evaluate the landscape of immunity and the role of spatial movement for measles introductions by retrospectively evaluating our ability to predict measles outbreaks in vaccinated populations. Using inferred spatial patterns of accumulation of susceptible individuals and travel data, we predicted the timing of epidemics in each district of Pakistan during a large measles outbreak in 2012-2013 with over 30 000 reported cases. We combined these data with mobility data extracted from over 40 million mobile phone subscribers during the same time frame in the country to quantify the role of connectivity in the spread of measles. We investigate how different approaches could contribute to targeting vaccination efforts to reach districts before outbreaks started. While some prediction was possible, accuracy was low and we discuss key uncertainties linked to existing data streams that impede such inference and detail what data might be necessary to robustly infer timing of epidemics.","1137":"We generated Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) data of much higher resolution than usual on retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness of a given eye. These consist of measurements made at hundreds of angular-points defined on a circular coordinate system. Traditional analysis of OCT RNFL data does not utilize insightful characteristics such as its circularity and granularity for common downstream applications. To address this, we present a new circular statistical framework that defines an Angular Decay function and thereby provides a directionally precise representation of an eye with attention to patterns of focused RNFL loss. By applying to a clinical cohort of Asian Indian eyes, the generated circular data were modeled with a finite mixture of von Mises distributions, which led to an unsupervised identification in different age-groups of recurrent clusters of glaucomatous eyes with distinct directional signatures of RNFL decay. New indices of global and local RNFL loss were computed for comparing the structural differences between these glaucoma clusters across the age-groups and improving classification. Further, we built a catalog of directionally precise statistical distributions of RNFL thickness for the said population of normal eyes as stratified by their age and optic disc size.","1138":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, mask wearing in public settings has been a key control measure. However, the reported effectiveness of masking has been much lower than laboratory measures of efficacy, leading to doubts on the utility of masking. Here, we develop an agent-based model that comprehensively accounts for individual masking behaviours and infectious disease dynamics, and test the impact of masking on epidemic outcomes. Using realistic inputs of mask efficacy and contact data at the individual level, the model reproduces the lower effectiveness as reported in randomized controlled trials. Model results demonstrate that transmission within households, where masks are rarely used, can substantially lower effectiveness, and reveal the interaction of nonlinear epidemic dynamics, control measures and potential measurement biases. Overall, model results show that, at the individual level, consistent masking can reduce the risk of first infection and, over time, reduce the frequency of repeated infection. At the population level, masking can provide direct protection to mask wearers, as well as indirect protection to non-wearers, collectively reducing epidemic intensity. These findings suggest it is prudent for individuals to use masks during an epidemic, and for policymakers to recognize the less-than-ideal effectiveness of masking when devising public health interventions.","1139":"Using patient-level data from a single site combined with only aggregated information from other sites, we constructed a surrogate likelihood function, approximating the Cox partial likelihood function obtained using patient-level data from all sites. By maximizing the surrogate likelihood function, each site obtained a local estimate of the model parameter, and the ODAC estimator was constructed as a weighted average of all the local estimates. We evaluated the performance of ODAC with (1) a simulation study and (2) a real-world use case study using 4 datasets from the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics network.We developed and evaluated a privacy-preserving One-shot Distributed Algorithm to fit a multicenter Cox proportional hazards model (ODAC) without sharing patient-level information across sites.On the one hand, our simulation study showed that ODAC provided estimates nearly the same as the estimator obtained by analyzing, in a single dataset, the combined patient-level data from all sites (ie, the pooled estimator). The relative bias was <0.1% across all scenarios. The accuracy of ODAC remained high across different sample sizes and event rates. On the other hand, the meta-analysis estimator, which was obtained by the inverse variance weighted average of the site-specific estimates, had substantial bias when the event rate is <5%, with the relative bias reaching 20% when the event rate is 1%. In the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics network application, the ODAC estimates have a relative bias <5% for 15 out of 16 log hazard ratios, whereas the meta-analysis estimates had substantially higher bias than ODAC.ODAC is a privacy-preserving and noniterative method for implementing time-to-event analyses across multiple sites. It provides estimates on par with the pooled estimator and substantially outperforms the meta-analysis estimator when the event is uncommon, making it extremely suitable for studying rare events and diseases in a distributed manner.","1140":"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and buprenorphine decrease HIV acquisition. Between November, 2016 and July, 2017, we surveyed persons (N\u2009=\u2009200) at a drug detoxification center to assess their interest in PrEP and in buprenorphine, and to examine factors associated with such interests. Over the previous 6\u00a0months, 58% (117\/200) injected drugs, 87% (173\/200) used opioids, 50% (85\/171) had condomless sex. Only 22% (26\/117) of persons who injected drugs were aware of PrEP, yet 74% (86\/116) and 72% (84\/116) were interested in oral or injectable PrEP, respectively. Thirty-eight percent (47\/125) of persons not receiving buprenorphine or methadone expressed interest in buprenorphine. After multivariable adjustment, Latinx ethnicity was associated with interest in PrEP (aOR 3.80; 95% CI 1.37-10.53), while male gender (aOR 2.76; 95% CI 1.21-6.34) was associated with interest in buprenorphine. Opportunities exist to implement PrEP and buprenorphine within drug detoxification centers.Clinical trial registration NCT02869776.

Data were analyzed from January to May 2022.Clinicians are a key component of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) care. Yet, no prior studies have quantitatively investigated how PrEP adherence differs by clinician specialty.To understand the association between prescribing clinician specialty and patients not picking up (reversal\/abandonment) their initial PrEP prescription.Clinician specialties included primary care practitioners (PCPs), infectious disease (ID), or other specialties. Reversal was defined as a patient not picking up their insurer-approved initial PrEP prescription. Abandonment was defined as a patient who reversed and still did not pick their prescription within 365 days.Of the 37\u202f003 patients, 4439 (12%) were female and 32\u202f564 (88%) were male, and 77% were aged 25 to 54 years. A total of 24\u202f604 (67%) received prescriptions from PCPs, 3571 (10%) from ID specialists, and 8828 (24%) from other specialty clinicians. The prevalence of reversals for patients of PCPs, ID specialists, and other specialty clinicians was 18%, 18%, and 25%, respectively, and for abandonments was 12%, 12%, and 20%, respectively. After adjusting for confounding, logistic regression models showed that, compared with patients who were prescribed PrEP by a PCP, patients prescribed PrEP by ID specialists had 10% lower odds of reversals (odds ratio [OR], 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81-0.99) and 12% lower odds of abandonment (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78-0.98), while patients prescribed by other clinicians had 33% higher odds of reversals (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.25-1.41) and 54% higher odds of abandonment (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.44-1.65).The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that PCPs do most of the new PrEP prescribing and are a critical entry point for patients. PrEP adherence differs by clinician specialties, likely due to the populations served by them. Future studies to test interventions that provide adherence support and education are needed.","1142":"Using publicly available data we examined the association between state-level influenza vaccination and all-age P&I associated deaths in the US from the 2013-2014 influenza season to the 2018-2019 season. In the main model, we evaluated influenza vaccine uptake in all those age 6\u00a0months and older. We used a mixed-effects regression analysis with generalised least squares estimation to account for within state correlation in P&I mortality.These results using a population-level statistical approach provide additional support for the overall effectiveness of the US influenza vaccination program. This reassurance is critical given the importance of ensuring confidence in this life saving program. Future research is needed to expand on our approach using more refined data.From 2013-2014 through 2018-2019, the total number of all-age P&I related deaths during the influenza seasons was 480,111. The mean overall cumulative influenza vaccine uptake (age 6\u00a0months and older) across the states and years considered was 46.7%, with higher uptake (64.8%) observed in those aged\u00a0\u2265\u00a065\u00a0years. We found that overall influenza vaccine uptake (6\u00a0months and older) had a statistically significant protective association with the P&I death rate. This translated to a 0.33 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.47) per 100,000 population reduction in P&I deaths in the influenza season per 1% increase in overall influenza vaccine uptake.The influenza mortality burden has remained substantial in the United States (US) despite relatively high levels of influenza vaccine uptake. This has led to questions regarding the effectiveness of the program against this outcome, particularly in the elderly. The aim of this evaluation was to develop and explore a new approach to estimating the population-level effect of influenza vaccination uptake on pneumonia and influenza (P&I) associated deaths.","1143":"The human pathogens N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis display robust intra- and interstrain glycan diversity associated with their O-linked protein glycosylation (pgl) systems. In an effort to better understand the evolution and function of protein glycosylation operating there, we aimed to determine if other human-restricted, Neisseria species similarly glycosylate proteins and if so, to assess the levels of glycoform diversity. Comparative genomics revealed the conservation of a subset of genes minimally required for O-linked protein glycosylation glycan and established those pgl genes as core genome constituents of the genus. In conjunction with mass spectrometric-based glycan phenotyping, we found that extant glycoform repertoires in N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis and the closely related species N. polysaccharea and N. lactamica reflect the functional replacement of a progenitor glycan biosynthetic pathway. This replacement involved loss of pgl gene components of the primordial pathway coincident with the acquisition of two exogenous glycosyltransferase genes. Critical to this discovery was the identification of a ubiquitous but previously unrecognized glycosyltransferase gene (pglP) that has uniquely undergone parallel but independent pseudogenization in N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis. We suggest that the pseudogenization events are driven by processes of compositional epistasis leading to gene decay. Additionally, we documented instances where inter-species recombination influences pgl gene status and creates discordant genetic interactions due ostensibly to the multi-locus nature of pgl gene networks. In summary, these findings provide a novel perspective on the evolution of protein glycosylation systems and identify phylogenetically informative, genetic differences associated with Neisseria species.","1144":"). This data-driven result could help inform decisions by policy makers on collecting data during future equine disease outbreaks, as well as policies for AHS control.","1145":"Humans are exposed to a diverse mixture of chemical and non-chemical exposures across their lifetimes. Well-designed epidemiology studies as well as sophisticated exposure science and related technologies enable the investigation of the health impacts of mixtures. While existing statistical methods can address the most basic questions related to the association between environmental mixtures and health endpoints, there were gaps in our ability to learn from mixtures data in several common epidemiologic scenarios, including high correlation among health and exposure measures in space and\/or time, the presence of missing observations, the violation of important modeling assumptions, and the presence of computational challenges incurred by current implementations. To address these and other challenges, NIEHS initiated the Powering Research through Innovative methods for Mixtures in Epidemiology (PRIME) program, to support work on the development and expansion of statistical methods for mixtures. Six independent projects supported by PRIME have been highly productive but their methods have not yet been described collectively in a way that would inform application. We review 37 new methods from PRIME projects and summarize the work across previously published research questions, to inform methods selection and increase awareness of these new methods. We highlight important statistical advancements considering data science strategies, exposure-response estimation, timing of exposures, epidemiological methods, the incorporation of toxicity\/chemical information, spatiotemporal data, risk assessment, and model performance, efficiency, and interpretation. Importantly, we link to software to encourage application and testing on other datasets. This review can enable more informed analyses of environmental mixtures. We stress training for early career scientists as well as innovation in statistical methodology as an ongoing need. Ultimately, we direct efforts to the common goal of reducing harmful exposures to improve public health.","1146":"The mean age of the COVID-19 group was 56.0 \u00b1 6.6 years old, while the control group was 58.1 \u00b1 7.3 years old. Longitudinal models indicated a significant decline in cognitive throughput (\u03b2 = -0.168, P = .001) following COVID-19, after adjustment for pre-COVID-19 functioning, demographics, and medical factors. Associations were larger in those with more severe COVID-19 and those who reported PASC. Observed changes in throughput were equivalent to 10.6 years of normal aging.Findings from this longitudinal causal modeling study revealed that COVID-19 and PASC appeared to cause clincially relevant cognitive deterioration.We analyzed longitudinal cognitive data collected during a cohort study of essential workers at midlife that continued through the COVID-19 pandemic. We used longitudinal discontinuity models, a form of causal modeling, to examine the change in cognitive performance among 276 participants with COVID-19 in comparison to contemporaneously-collected information from 217 participants who did not have COVID-19. Cognitive performance across four domains was measured before and after the pandemic. Eligible study participants were those with validated COVID-19 diagnoses who were observed before having a verified COVID-19 infection who survived their initial infection, and for whom post-COVID-19 information was also available.Research into COVID-19-related cognitive decline has focused on individuals who are cognitively impaired following hospitalization for COVID-19. Our objective was to determine whether cognitive decline emerged after the onset of COVID-19 and was more pronounced in patients with postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC).","1147":"Climate change impacts on health, including increased exposures to heat, poor air quality, extreme weather events, and altered vector-borne disease transmission, reduced water quality, and decreased food security, affect men and women differently due to biologic, socioeconomic, and cultural factors. In India, where rapid environmental changes are taking place, climate change threatens to widen existing gender-based health disparities. Integration of a gendered perspective into existing climate, development, and disaster-risk reduction policy frameworks can decrease negative health outcomes. Modifying climate risks requires multisector coordination, improvement in data acquisition, monitoring of gender specific targets, and equitable stakeholder engagement. Empowering women as agents of social change can improve mitigation and adaptation policy interventions.","1148":"Limited initial supply of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine raises the question of how to prioritize available doses. Here, we used a mathematical model to compare five age-stratified prioritization strategies. A highly effective transmission-blocking vaccine prioritized to adults ages 20-49 years minimized cumulative incidence, but mortality and years of life lost were minimized in most scenarios when the vaccine was prioritized to adults over 60 years old. Use of individual-level serological tests to redirect doses to seronegative individuals improved the marginal impact of each dose while potentially reducing existing inequities in COVID-19 impact. While maximum impact prioritization strategies were broadly consistent across countries, transmission rates, vaccination rollout speeds, and estimates of naturally acquired immunity, this framework can be used to compare impacts of prioritization strategies across contexts.","1149":"Understanding healthcare system resilience has become paramount, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which imposed unprecedented burdens on healthcare services and severely impacted public health. Resilience is defined as the system's ability to absorb, recover from and adapt to disruptions; however, despite extensive studies on this subject, we still lack empirical evidence and mathematical tools to quantify its adaptability (the ability of the system to adjust to and learn from disruptions). By analyzing millions of patients' electronic medical records across US states, we find that the COVID-19 pandemic caused two successive waves of disruptions within the healthcare systems, enabling natural experiment analysis of the adaptive capacity of each system to adapt to past disruptions. We generalized the quantification framework and found that the US healthcare systems exhibit substantial adaptability (\u03c1\u2009=\u20090.58) but only a moderate level of resilience (r\u2009=\u20090.70). When considering system responses across racial groups, Black and Hispanic groups were more severely impacted by pandemic disruptions than white and Asian groups. Physician abundance was the key characteristic for determining healthcare system resilience. Our results offer vital guidance in designing resilient and sustainable healthcare systems to prepare for future waves of disruptions akin to COVID-19 pandemics.","1150":"Inverse probability weighted Cox models can be used to estimate marginal hazard ratios under different point treatments in observational studies. To obtain variance estimates, the robust sandwich variance estimator is often recommended to account for the induced correlation among weighted observations. However, this estimator does not incorporate the uncertainty in estimating the weights and tends to overestimate the variance, leading to inefficient inference. Here we propose a new variance estimator that combines the estimation procedures for the hazard ratio and weights using stacked estimating equations, with additional adjustments for the sum of terms that are not independently and identically distributed in a Cox partial likelihood score equation. We prove analytically that the robust sandwich variance estimator is conservative and establish the asymptotic equivalence between the proposed variance estimator and one obtained through linearization by Hajage et\u00a0al. in 2018. In addition, we extend our proposed variance estimator to accommodate clustered data. We compare the finite sample performance of the proposed method with alternative methods through simulation studies. We illustrate these different variance methods in both independent and clustered data settings, using a bariatric surgery dataset and a multiple readmission dataset, respectively. To facilitate implementation of the proposed method, we have developed an R package ipwCoxCSV.","1151":"The first year of the COVID-19 pandemic put considerable strain on healthcare systems worldwide. In order to predict the effect of the local epidemic on hospital capacity in England, we used a variety of data streams to inform the construction and parameterisation of a hospital progression model, EpiBeds, which was coupled to a model of the generalised epidemic. In this model, individuals progress through different pathways (e.g. may recover, die, or progress to intensive care and recover or die) and data from a partially complete patient-pathway line-list was used to provide initial estimates of the mean duration that individuals spend in the different hospital compartments. We then fitted EpiBeds using complete data on hospital occupancy and hospital deaths, enabling estimation of the proportion of individuals that follow the different clinical pathways, the reproduction number of the generalised epidemic, and to make short-term predictions of hospital bed demand. The construction of EpiBeds makes it straightforward to adapt to different patient pathways and settings beyond England. As part of the UK response to the pandemic, EpiBeds provided weekly forecasts to the NHS for hospital bed occupancy and admissions in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland at national and regional scales.","1152":"Noroviruses are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in the United States and outbreaks frequently occur in daycare settings. Results of norovirus vaccine trials have been promising, however there are open questions as to whether vaccination of daycare children would be cost-effective. We investigated the incremental cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical norovirus vaccination for children in daycare settings compared to no vaccination.We conducted a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis using a disease transmission model of children attending daycare. Vaccination with a 90% coverage rate in addition to the observed standard of care (exclusion of symptomatic children from daycare) was compared to the observed standard of care. The main outcomes measures were infections and deaths averted, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Cost-effectiveness was analyzed from a societal perspective, including medical costs to children as well as productivity losses of parents, over a two-year time horizon. Data sources included outbreak surveillance data and published literature.Due to the large disease burden associated with norovirus, it is likely that vaccinating children in daycares could be cost-effective, even with modest vaccine efficacy and a high per-child cost of vaccination. Norovirus vaccination of children in daycare has a cost-effectiveness ratio similar to other commonly recommended childhood vaccines.A 50% efficacious norovirus vaccine averts 571.83 norovirus cases and 0.003 norovirus-related deaths per 10,000 children compared to the observed standard of care. A $200 norovirus vaccine that is 50% efficacious has a net cost increase of $178.10 per child and 0.025 more QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $7,028\/QALY. Based on the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, we estimated that a $200 vaccination with 50% efficacy was 94.0% likely to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of $100,000\/QALY threshold and 95.3% likely at a $150,000\/QALY threshold.","1153":"Our study computed, for the Indian states in the EIGP region, the first area-level small area estimates of food insecurity as well as poverty over the past decade, and generated a ranked list of districts upon combining these data with measures of crop diversity and climatic vulnerability.Our district-level estimates and maps can be effective for informed policy-making to build local resiliency and address systemic vulnerabilities where they matter most in the post-pandemic era.Our Small Area Estimation approach estimated food insecurity prevalence, gap, and severity of each rural district of the Eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain (EIGP) region by modeling the HCES data, guided by local covariates from the 2011 Indian Population Census.In HCES, 5915 (34429), 3310 (17534) and 3566 (15223) households (persons) were surveyed from the 71, 38 and 18 districts of the EIGP states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal respectively.The latest round of available data from the Household Consumer Expenditure Survey (HCES 2011-12) done by the National Sample Survey Office of India used stratified multi-stage random sampling with districts as strata, villages as first stage and households as second stage units.We estimated the district-specific food insecurity indicators, and mapped their local disparities over the EIGP region. By comparing food insecurity with indicators of climate vulnerability, poverty and crop diversity, we shortlisted the vulnerable districts in EIGP.Food security is an important policy issue in India. As India recently ranked 107th out of 121 countries in the 2022 Global Hunger Index, there is an urgent need to dissect, and gain insights into, such a major decline at the national level. However, the existing surveys, due to small sample sizes, cannot be used directly to produce reliable estimates at local administrative levels such as districts.","1154":"The model suggested that with age-targeted screening programmes incidence elimination could be brought forward by several years. However, WHO elimination goals may not be met by 2030.Population structure did not appear to affect the timeline of elimination targets and screening individuals over the age of 30 at a high (50% per year) coverage could bring forward achievement of the incidence elimination target by four years compared to baseline (approximately 6% per year). Achievement of mortality elimination targets was not reached until after the end of the simulation (2040), and intensive screening strategies did not appear to lead to incidence elimination by 2030.Hepatitis C Virus is endemic to many areas of Thailand, whose population structure is tending towards older age groups as birth rate and mortality decrease. With around 790,000 cases in 2019, prevalence is still relatively high, but the World Health Organisation has called for elimination of HCV by 2030.An age structured compartmental transmission model was used to explore the effectiveness of screening strategies with respect to WHO elimination goals, as well as the effect of changing population structure on the success or failure of such strategies.","1155":"NCT02618902 and NCT02903537; EudraCT numbers: 2015-002975-16 and 2015-003541-26.Here, we will evaluate the clinical use of tolDC in a well-defined population of MS patients in two phase I clinical trials. In doing so, we aim to compare two ways of tolDC administration, namely intradermal and intranodal. The cells will be injected at consecutive intervals in three cohorts receiving incremental doses of tolDC, according to a best-of-five design. The primary objective is to assess the safety and feasibility of tolDC administration. For safety, the number of adverse events including MRI and clinical outcomes will be assessed. For feasibility, successful production of tolDC will be determined. Secondary endpoints include clinical and MRI outcome measures. The patients' immune profile will be assessed to find presumptive evidence for a tolerogenic effect in vivo.Based on the advances in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), currently available disease-modifying treatments (DMT) have positively influenced the disease course of MS. However, the efficacy of DMT is highly variable and increasing treatment efficacy comes with a more severe risk profile. Hence, the unmet need for safer and more selective treatments remains. Specifically restoring immune tolerance towards myelin antigens may provide an attractive alternative. In this respect, antigen-specific tolerisation with autologous tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDC) is a promising approach.Ethics approval was obtained for the two phase I clinical trials. The results of the trials will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal, at scientific conferences and to patient associations.","1156":"Nationwide nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been effective at mitigating the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but their broad impact on other diseases remains under-investigated. Here we report an ecological analysis comparing the incidence of 31 major notifiable infectious diseases in China in 2020 to the average level during 2014-2019, controlling for temporal phases defined by NPI intensity levels. Respiratory diseases and gastrointestinal or enteroviral diseases declined more than sexually transmitted or bloodborne diseases and vector-borne or zoonotic diseases. Early pandemic phases with more stringent NPIs were associated with greater reductions in disease incidence. Non-respiratory diseases, such as hand, foot and mouth disease, rebounded substantially towards the end of the year 2020 as the NPIs were relaxed. Statistical modeling analyses confirm that strong NPIs were associated with a broad mitigation effect on communicable diseases, but resurgence of non-respiratory diseases should be expected when the NPIs, especially restrictions of human movement and gathering, become less stringent.","1157":"Anti-M\u03cbllerian hormone varies between women and declines exponentially during pregnancy.

Anti-M\u03cbllerian hormone (pmol\/L) was measured in plasma samples collected at 5 prenatal care visits throughout gestation.Anti-M\u03cbllerian hormone (AMH) plays an important role regulating ovarian sensitivity to follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone in folliculogenesis. Anti-M\u03cbllerian hormone is well established as a biomarker of ovarian reserve but may also have utility in predicting pregnancy outcomes. Few studies have described AMH levels in pregnancy and, among those that have, most have used cross-sectional study designs and are limited to participants seeking fertility treatment.

Targeting HCWs had a higher per-regimen impact than population-wide vaccination.Despite large outbreaks in humans seeming improbable for a number of zoonotic pathogens, several pose a concern due to their epidemiological characteristics and evolutionary potential. To enable effective responses to these pathogens in the event that they undergo future emergence, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations is advancing the development of vaccines for several pathogens prioritized by the World Health Organization. A major challenge in this pursuit is anticipating demand for a vaccine stockpile to support outbreak response.Our framework provides a flexible methodology for estimating vaccine stockpile needs and the geographic distribution of demand under a range of outbreak response scenarios. Uncertainties in our model estimates highlight several knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to target vulnerable populations more accurately. These include surveillance gaps that mask the true geographic distribution of each pathogen, details of key routes of spillover from animal reservoirs to humans, and the role of human-to-human transmission outside of healthcare settings. In addition, our estimates are based on the current epidemiology of each pathogen, but pathogen evolution could alter vaccine stockpile requirements.We developed a modeling framework for outbreak response for emerging zoonoses under three reactive vaccination strategies to assess sustainable vaccine manufacturing needs, vaccine stockpile requirements, and the potential impact of the outbreak response. This framework incorporates geographically variable zoonotic spillover rates, human-to-human transmission, and the implementation of reactive vaccination campaigns in response to disease outbreaks. As proof of concept, we applied the framework to four priority pathogens: Lassa virus, Nipah virus, MERS coronavirus, and Rift Valley virus.","1159":"Several observational studies have shown decreases in measured influenza vaccine effectiveness (mVE) during influenza seasons. One study found decreases of 6%-11% per month during the 2011-12 to 2014-15 seasons. These findings could indicate waning immunity but could also occur if vaccine effectiveness is stable and vaccine provides partial protection in all vaccinees (\"leaky\") rather than complete protection in a subset of vaccinees. Since it is not known whether influenza vaccine is leaky, we simulated the 2011-12 to 2014-15 influenza seasons to estimate the potential contribution of leaky vaccine effect to the observed decline in mVE.We used available data to estimate daily numbers of vaccinations and infections with A\/H1N1, A\/H3N2 and B viruses. We assumed that vaccine effect was leaky, calculated mVE as 1 minus the Mantel-Haenszel relative risk of vaccine on incident cases and determined the mean mVE change per 30 days since vaccination. Because change in mVE was highly dependent on infection rates, we performed simulations using low (15%) and high (31%) total (including symptomatic and asymptomatic) seasonal infection rates.For the low infection rate, decreases (absolute) in mVE per 30 days after vaccination were 2% for A\/H1N1 and 1% for A\/H3N2and B viruses. For high infection rate, decreases were 5% for A\/H1N1, 4% for A\/H3, and 3% for B viruses.The leaky vaccine bias could account for some, but probably not all of the observed intra-seasonal decreases in mVE. These results underscore the need for strategies to deal with intra-seasonal vaccine effectiveness decline.","1160":"Livestock has been implicated as a reservoir for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes that can spread to humans when antimicrobials are used in animals for food production to treat clinical diseases and prevent and control common disease events. In Vietnam, mcr-1-harboring Escherichia coli (MCRPEC) strains have been isolated from humans, animals (chickens, pigs, and dogs) feces, flies, foods, and the environment (rainwater, well water, and irrigation water) in communities and from clinical specimens in hospitals. The relationship between levels of AMR in livestock and its occurrence in humans is complex and is driven by many factors. We conducted whole genome sequencing of MCRPEC to analyze the molecular epidemiological characteristics, history, and relatedness of 50 isolates obtained in 2019 from different reservoirs in farms and markets in Ha Nam province, Vietnam. 34 sequence types (STs) with 3 new STs were identified in multilocus sequence typing analysis: ST12945 and ST12946 from chicken feces, and ST12947 from flies. The AMR phenotypes of 50 MCRPEC isolates were as follows: ampicillin (100%, 50\/50), cefotaxime (10%, 5\/50), gentamicin (60%, 30\/50), amikacin (8%, 4\/50), meropenem (6%, 3\/50), ceftazidime (18%, 9\/50), colistin (24%, 12\/50) and ciprofloxacin (80%, 40\/50). All 50 MCRPEC isolates were identified as MDR. 100% (50\/50) isolates carried AMR genes, ranging from 5 to 22 genes. The most prevalent plasmid replicon types carrying mcr-1 were IncP-1 (17\/37, 45.9%), IncX4 (7\/37, 18.9%), and IncHI2\/IncHI2A (6\/37, 16.2%). These data suggest that the epidemiology of the mcr-1 gene is mostly determined by plasmid spreading instead of clonal dissemination of MCRPE strains. The co-occurrence of several STs such as ST10, ST48, ST155, ST206, ST2705 in various sample types, joined to the higher prevalence of a few types of Inc plasmids, confirms the dissemination of the mcr-1 carrying plasmids in E. coli clones established in livestock. 5 over 8 STs identified in flies (ST206, ST2705, ST155, ST10, and ST48) suggested the fly contribution in the transmission of AMR bacteria in environments. These popular STs also occur in human samples and 100% of the human samples were positive for the mcr-1 gene.","1161":"Human movement is increasingly being recognized as a major driver of arbovirus risk and dissemination. The Communities Organized to Prevent Arboviruses (COPA) study is a cohort in southern Puerto Rico to measure arboviral prevalence, evaluate interventions, and collect mobility data. To quantify the relationship between arboviral prevalence and human mobility patterns, we fit multilevel logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios for mobility-related predictors of positive chikungunya IgG or Zika IgM test results collected from COPA, assuming mobility data does not change substantially from year to year. From May 8, 2018-June 8, 2019, 39% of the 1,845 active participants during the study period had a positive arboviral seroprevalence result. Most (74%) participants reported spending five or more weekly hours outside of their home. A 1% increase in weekly hours spent outside the home was associated with a 4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2-7%) decrease in the odds of testing positive for arbovirus. After adjusting for age and whether a person had air conditioning (AC) at home, any time spent in a work location was protective against arbovirus infection (32% decrease, CI: 9-49%). In fact, there was a general decreased prevalence for individuals who visited locations that were inside and had AC or screens, regardless of the type of location (32% decrease, CI: 12-47%). In this population, the protective characteristics of locations visited appear to be the most important driver of the relationship between mobility and arboviral prevalence. This relationship indicates that not all mobility is the same, with elements like screens and AC providing protection in some locations. These findings highlight the general importance of AC and screens, which are known to be protective against mosquitoes and mosquito-transmitted diseases.","1162":"There were approximately 781\u202f000 total deaths in the United States from March 1 to May 30, 2020, representing 122\u202f300 (95% prediction interval, 116\u202f800-127\u202f000) more deaths than would typically be expected at that time of year. There were 95\u202f235 reported deaths officially attributed to COVID-19 from March 1 to May 30, 2020. The number of excess all-cause deaths was 28% higher than the official tally of COVID-19-reported deaths during that period. In several states, these deaths occurred before increases in the availability of COVID-19 diagnostic tests and were not counted in official COVID-19 death records. There was substantial variability between states in the difference between official COVID-19 deaths and the estimated burden of excess deaths.To estimate the burden of all deaths related to COVID-19 in the United States from March to May 2020.Excess deaths provide an estimate of the full COVID-19 burden and indicate that official tallies likely undercount deaths due to the virus. The mortality burden and the completeness of the tallies vary markedly between states.This observational study evaluated the numbers of US deaths from any cause and deaths from pneumonia, influenza, and\/or COVID-19 from March 1 through May 30, 2020, using public data of the entire US population from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). These numbers were compared with those from the same period of previous years. All data analyzed were accessed on June 12, 2020.Increases in weekly deaths due to any cause or deaths due to pneumonia\/influenza\/COVID-19 above a baseline, which was adjusted for time of year, influenza activity, and reporting delays. These estimates were compared with reported deaths attributed to COVID-19 and with testing data.Efforts to track the severity and public health impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States have been hampered by state-level differences in diagnostic test availability, differing strategies for prioritization of individuals for testing, and delays between testing and reporting. Evaluating unexplained increases in deaths due to all causes or attributed to nonspecific outcomes, such as pneumonia and influenza, can provide a more complete picture of the burden of COVID-19.","1163":"Streptococcus pneumoniae causes a high disease burden including pneumonia, meningitis and septicemia. Both a polysaccharide vaccine targeting 23\u00a0serotypes (PPV23) and a 13-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV13) are indicated for persons aged over 50\u00a0years. We developed and parameterized a static multi-cohort model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness and budget-impact of these vaccines at different uptake levels. Using three different vaccine efficacy scenarios regarding non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia and extensive uni- and multivariate sensitivity analyses, we found a strong preference for PPV23 over PCV13 in all age groups at willingness to pay levels below \u20ac300 000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY). PPV23 vaccination would cost on average about \u20ac83\u00a0000, \u20ac60\u00a0000 and \u20ac52\u00a0000 per QALY gained in 50-64, 65-74 and 75-84\u00a0year olds, whereas for PCV13 this is about \u20ac171\u00a0000, \u20ac201\u00a0000 and \u20ac338\u00a0000, respectively. Strategies combining PPV23 and PCV13 vaccines were most effective but generally less cost-effective. When assuming a combination of increased duration of PCV13 protection, increased disease burden preventable by PCV13 and a 75% reduction of the PCV13 price, PCV13 could become more attractive in <75 year olds, but would remain less attractive than PPV23 from age 75\u00a0years onwards. These observations are independent of the assumption that PPV23 has 0% efficacy against non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia. Pneumococcal vaccination would be most cost-effective in Belgium, when achieving high uptake with PPV23 in 75-84 year olds, as well as by negotiating a lower market-conform PPV23 price to improve uptake and cost-effectiveness.","1164":"This study considers demographic, clinical, and geographic correlates of influenza vaccination among Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries in 2015-2016 and maps the data on a geographic information system (GIS) at the zip code level.Urgent and targeted efforts are needed to equitably increase IIV rates, thus protecting the most vulnerable populations from the negative health impact of influenza as well as the tax-paying public from the Medicare costs from failing to do so.Despite improved understanding of the risks of influenza and better vaccines for older patients, influenza vaccination rates remain subpar, including in high-risk groups such as older adults, and demonstrate significant racial and ethnic disparities.Analyses confirm that only half of the senior beneficiaries evidenced a claim for receiving an inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), with significant disparities observed among black, Hispanic, rural, and poorer beneficiaries. More extensive disparities were observed for the high-dose (HD) vaccine, with its added protection for older populations and confirmed economic benefit. Most white beneficiaries received HD; no non-white subgroup did so. Mapping of the data confirmed subpar vaccination in vulnerable populations with wide variations at the zip code level.","1165":"Using mathematical modeling, we find that workers in enclosed food manufacturing facilities are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection from close contact transmission (exposure to large droplets and small aerosol particles) than fomite transmission. Thus, strategies protecting workers should prioritize close contact transmission pathways, such as physical distancing, universal mask use, and room air changes, with surface disinfection (reducing fomite transmission) and handwashing of secondary importance. Our work supports current international (EU-OSHA), domestic (FDA, OSHA), and food industry-standard guidance for managing COVID-19 transmission in essential workers in the food manufacturing sector. Although our model was designed for an indoor food manufacturing setting, it can be readily adapted to other indoor environments and infectious respiratory pathogens.The SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic poses significant health risks to workers who are essential to maintaining the food supply chain. Using a quantitative risk assessment model, this study characterized the impact of risk reduction strategies for controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission (droplet, aerosol, fomite-mediated) among front-line workers in a representative enclosed food manufacturing facility. We simulated: 1) individual and cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infection risks from close contact (droplet and aerosols at 1-3m), aerosol, and fomite-mediated exposures to a susceptible worker following exposure to an infected worker during an 8h-shift; and 2) the relative reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection risk attributed to infection control interventions (physical distancing, mask use, ventilation, surface disinfection, hand hygiene). Without mitigation measures, the SARS-CoV-2 infection risk was largest for close contact (droplet and aerosol) at 1m (0.96, 95%CI: 0.67-1.0). In comparison, risk associated with fomite (0.26, 95%CI: 0.10-0.56) or aerosol exposure alone (0.05, 95%CI: 0.01-0.13) at 1m distance was substantially lower (73-95%). At 1m, droplet transmission predominated over aerosol and fomite-mediated transmission, however, this changed by 3m, with aerosols comprising the majority of the exposure dose. Increasing physical distancing reduced risk by 84% (1 to 2m) and 91% (1 to 3m). Universal mask use reduced infection risk by 52-88%, depending on mask type. Increasing ventilation (from 0.1 to 2-8 air changes\/hour) resulted in risk reductions of 14-54% (1m) and 55-85% (2m). Combining these strategies, together with handwashing and surface disinfection, resulted in <1% infection risk. Current industry SARS-CoV-2 risk reduction strategies, particularly when bundled, provide significant protection to essential food workers.","1166":"Leptospirosis is a zoonosis with global public health impact, particularly in poor socio-economic settings in tropical regions. Transmitted through urine-contaminated water or soil from rodents, dogs, and livestock, leptospirosis causes over a million clinical cases annually. Risk factors include outdoor activities, livestock production, and substandard housing that foster high densities of animal reservoirs. This One Health study in southern Chile examined Leptospira serological evidence of exposure in people from urban slums, semi-rural settings, and farm settings, using the Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm to identify key influencing factors. In urban slums, age, shrub terrain, distance to Leptospira-positive households, and neighborhood housing density were contributing factors. Human exposure in semi-rural communities was linked to environmental factors (trees, shrubs, and lower vegetation terrain) and animal variables (Leptospira-positive dogs and rodents and proximity to Leptospira-positive households). On farms, dog counts, animal Leptospira prevalence, and proximity to Leptospira-contaminated water samples were significant drivers. The study underscores that disease dynamics vary across landscapes, with distinct drivers in each community setting. This case study demonstrates how the integration of machine learning with comprehensive cross-sectional epidemiological and geospatial data provides valuable insights into leptospirosis eco-epidemiology. These insights are crucial for informing targeted public health strategies and generating hypotheses for future research.","1167":"Performance of the NAATs for chlamydia and gonorrhoea detection using vaginal specimens was similar to that of cervical and urine specimens relative to PIS. As vaginal samples have a higher acceptability and lower cost, the study can support clinical testing guidelines by providing evidence that vaginal samples are a suitable alternative to traditionally used specimens.Performance is defined as the sensitivity of a NAAT using a specimen site and PIS of the patient. We assessed risk of bias using modified QUADAS-2.Nine publications met the inclusion criteria (eight for chlamydia; six for gonorrhoea) and were narratively reviewed. Pooled summary estimates were not calculated due to the variable methodology and PIS definitions. Tests performed on vaginal specimens accomplished similar performance to cervical and urine specimens for chlamydia (range of performance estimates: vaginal 65%-100%, cervical 59%-97%, urine 57%-100%) and gonorrhoea (vaginal 64%-100%, cervical 85%-100%, urine 67%-94%). Vaginal specimens were estimated to have a performance >80% for chlamydia and gonorrhoea infections in all but one study.We evaluated the performance of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) using vaginal specimens in comparison to specimens from the cervix or urine in their ability to detect chlamydia and gonorrhoea infection in women based on patient infection status (PIS).We included studies that tested samples from the vagina and \u22651\u2009other site (cervix and\/or urine) with \u22652 NAATs for chlamydia and \u22652 NAATs or 1 NAAT and culture for gonorrhoea for each site.Systematic review.EMBASE and Ovid MEDLINE databases were searched through 3 October 2017.","1168":"This is a perspective article entitled \"Frontiers in computational biophysics: understanding conformational dynamics of complex lipid mixtures relevant to biology\" which is following a CECAM meeting with the same name.","1169":"Background. The Mobility and Vitality Lifestyle Program (MOVE UP) is a behavioral weight-management intervention for improving mobility among community-dwelling older adults. We examined program factors that affect implementation outcomes and participant-level health outcomes. Methods. The MOVE UP program was implemented in the greater Pittsburgh area from January 2015 to June 2019 to improve lower extremity performance in community-dwelling older adults who were overweight or obese. Thirty-two sessions were delivered over 13 months. All sessions were designed to be 1-hour in length, on-site, group-based, and led by trained and supported community health workers (CHWs). Participants completed weekly Lifestyle Logs for self-monitoring of body weight, diet, and physical activity. We evaluated the MOVE UP program using the RE-AIM framework, and collected quantitative data at baseline, 5-, 9-, and 13-months. Multilevel linear regression models assessed the impacts of program factors (site, CHW, and participant characteristics) on implementation outcomes and participant-level health outcomes. Results. Twenty-two CHWs delivered MOVE UP program to 303 participants in 26 cohorts. Participants were similar to the target source population in weight but differed in some demographic characteristics. The program was effective for weight loss and lower extremity function in both intervention and maintenance periods (Ps < .01), with an independent effect for Lifestyle Logs submission but not session attendance. Discussion. CHWs were able to deliver a multi-component weight loss intervention effectively in community settings. CHW and site characteristics had independent impacts on participants' adherence. Lifestyle Log submission may be a more potent measure of adherence in weight loss interventions than attendance.","1170":"Mosquito borne flaviviruses, including dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses, have caused global epidemics in areas with high HIV prevalence due to the expanded geographic range of arthropod vectors. Despite the occurrence of large flavivirus outbreaks in countries with high HIV prevalence, there is little knowledge regarding the effects of flavivirus infection in people living with HIV (PLWH). Here, we use a pigtail macaque model of HIV\/AIDS to investigate the impact of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-induced immunosuppression on ZIKV replication and pathogenesis. Early acute SIV infection induced expansion of peripheral ZIKV cellular targets and increased innate immune activation and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from SIV infected macaques were less permissive to ZIKV infection in vitro. In SIV-ZIKV co-infected animals, we found increased persistence of ZIKV in the periphery and tissues corresponding to alterations in innate cellular (monocytes, neutrophils) recruitment to the blood and tissues, decreased anti-ZIKV immunity, and chronic peripheral inflammatory and innate immune gene expression. Collectively, these findings suggest that untreated SIV infection may impair cellular innate responses and create an environment of chronic immune activation that promotes prolonged ZIKV viremia and persistence in the gastrointestinal tract. These results suggest that PLWH or other immunocompromised individuals could be at a higher risk for chronic ZIKV replication, which in turn could increase the timeframe of ZIKV transmission. Thus, PLWH are important populations to target during the deployment of vaccine and treatment strategies against ZIKV.","1171":"Electronic medical record reviews, infection control observations, and environmental sampling completed the epidemiologic outbreak investigation. A laboratory analysis, conducted on patient and environmental isolates, included long-read whole-genome sequencing to fully elucidate plasmid DNA structures. Bioinformatics analyses were applied to infer plasmid transmission chains and results were subsequently confirmed using plasmid conjugation experiments.Antibiotic resistance is often spread through bacterial populations via conjugative plasmids. However, plasmid transfer is not well recognized in clinical settings because of technical limitations, and health care-associated infections are usually caused by clonal transmission of a single pathogen. In 2015, multiple species of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), all producing a rare carbapenemase, were identified among patients in an intensive care unit. This observation suggested a large, previously unrecognized plasmid transmission chain and prompted our investigation.We identified 14 Verona integron-encoded metallo-\u00df-lactamase (VIM)-producing CRE in 12 patients, and 1 additional isolate was obtained from a patient room sink drain. Whole-genome sequencing identified the horizontal transfer of blaVIM-1, a rare carbapenem resistance mechanism in the United States, via a promiscuous incompatibility group A\/C2 plasmid that spread among 5 bacterial species isolated from patients and the environment.This investigation represents the largest known outbreak of VIM-producing CRE in the United States to date, which comprises numerous bacterial species and strains. We present evidence of in-hospital plasmid transmission, as well as environmental contamination. Our findings demonstrate the potential for 2 types of hospital-acquired infection outbreaks: those due to clonal expansion and those due to the spread of conjugative plasmids encoding antibiotic resistance across species.","1172":"Express lanes (ELs) implementation is a proven strategy to deal with freeway traffic congestion. Dynamic toll pricing schemes effectively achieve reliable travel time on ELs. The primary inputs for the typical dynamic pricing algorithms are vehicular volumes and speeds derived from the data collected by sensors installed along the ELs. Thus, the operation of dynamic pricing critically depends on the accuracy of data collected by such traffic sensors. However, no previous research has been conducted to explicitly investigate the impact of sensor failures and erroneous sensors' data on toll computations. This research fills this gap by examining the effects of sensor failure and faulty detection scenarios on ELs tolls calculated by a dynamic pricing algorithm. The paper's methodology relies on applying the dynamic toll pricing algorithm implemented in the field and utilizing the fundamental speed-volume relationship to 'simulate' the sensors' reported data. We implemented the methodology in a case study of ELs on Interstate-95 in Southeast Florida. The results have shown that the tolls increase when sensors erroneously report higher than actual traffic demand. Moreover, it has been found that the accuracy of individual sensors and the number of sensors utilized to estimate traffic conditions are critical for accurate toll calculations.","1173":"First identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has affected over 16,800,000 people worldwide as of July 29, 2020 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. Influenza studies have shown that influenza viruses survive longer on surfaces or in droplets in cold and dry air, thus increasing the likelihood of subsequent transmission. A similar hypothesis has been postulated for the transmission of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. It is important to propose methodologies to understand the effects of environmental factors on this ongoing outbreak to support decision-making pertaining to disease control. Here, we examine the spatial variability of the basic reproductive numbers of COVID-19 across provinces and cities in China and show that environmental variables alone cannot explain this variability. Our findings suggest that changes in weather (i.e., increase of temperature and humidity as spring and summer months arrive in the Northern Hemisphere) will not necessarily lead to declines in case counts without the implementation of drastic public health interventions.","1174":"Individual behavior change is a critical ingredient in efforts to improve global health. Central to the focus on behavior has been a growing understanding of how the human brain makes decisions, from motivations and mindsets to unconscious biases and cognitive shortcuts. Recent work in the field of behavioral economics and related fields has contributed to a rich menu of insights and principles that can be engineered into global health programs to increase impact and reach. However, there is little research on the process of designing and testing interventions informed by behavioral insights.In a study focused on increasing household participation in a Chagas disease vector control campaign in Arequipa, Peru, we applied Datta and Mullainathan's \"behavioral design\" approach to formulate and test specific interventions. In this Technical Advance article we describe the behavioral design approach in detail, including the Define, Diagnosis, Design, and Test phases. We also show how the interventions designed through the behavioral design process were adapted for a pragmatic randomized controlled field trial.The behavioral design framework provided a systematic methodology for defining the behavior of interest, diagnosing reasons for household reluctance or refusal to participate, designing interventions to address actionable bottlenecks, and then testing those interventions in a rigorous counterfactual context. Behavioral design offered us a broader range of strategies and approaches than are typically used in vector\u00a0control campaigns.Careful attention to how behavioral design may affect internal and external validity of evaluations and the scalability of interventions is needed going forward. We recommend behavioral design as a useful complement to other intervention design and evaluation approaches in global health programs.","1175":"Community-driven responses are essential to ensure the adoption, reach and sustainability of evidence-based practices (EBPs) to prevent new cases of opioid use disorder (OUD) and reduce fatal and non-fatal overdoses. Most organizational approaches for selecting and implementing EBPs remain top-down and individually oriented without community engagement (CE). Moreover, few CE approaches have leveraged systems science to integrate community resources, values and priorities. This paper provides a novel CE paradigm that utilizes a data-driven and systems science approach; describes the composition, functions, and roles of researchers in CE; discusses unique ethical considerations that are particularly salient to CE research; and provides a description of how systems science and data-driven approaches to CE may be employed to select a range of EBPs that collectively address community needs. Finally, we conclude with scientific recommendations for the use of CE in research. Greater investment in CE research is needed to ensure contextual, equitable, and sustainable access to EBPs, such as medications for OUD (MOUD) in communities heavily impacted by the opioid epidemic. A data-driven approach to CE research guided by systems science has the potential to ensure adequate saturation and sustainability of EBPs that could significantly reduce opioid overdose and health inequities across the US.","1176":"Thyroid cancer incidence increased over 200% from 1992 to 2018, while mortality rates had not increased proportionately. The increased incidence has been attributed primarily to the detection of subclinical disease, raising important questions related to thyroid cancer control. We developed the Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma Microsimulation model (PATCAM) to answer them including the impact of overdiagnosis on thyroid cancer incidence.PATCAM successfully reproduced observed US thyroid cancer incidence and mortality over time and was externally validated. PATCAM can be used to identify factors that influence the detection of subclinical PTCs.PATCAM simulates individuals from age 15 until death in birth cohorts starting from 1975 using four inter-related components including natural history, detection, post-diagnosis, and other-cause mortality. PATCAM was built using high-quality data and calibrated against observed age-, sex- and stage-specific incidence in the US as reported by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. PATCAM was validated against US thyroid cancer mortality and three active surveillance studies including the largest and longest running thyroid cancer active surveillance cohort in the world (from Japan) and two from the US.PATCAM successfully replicated age- and stage-specific PTC incidence and mean tumor size at diagnosis and PTC mortality in the US between 1975 and 2015. PATCAM accurately predicted the proportion of tumors that grew more than 3 mm and 5 mm in 5 years and 10 years, aligning with the 95% confidence intervals of the reported rates from active surveillance studies in most cases.","1177":" (SP) serotypes, in response to the introduction of a cohort vaccination program which targets one of the two serotypes. The model is fitted to a pediatric SP carriage prevalence data from Atlanta, GA. The model, which is rigorously analysed to investigate the existence and asymptotic stability properties of the associated equilibria (in addition to exploring conditions for competitive exclusion), is simulated to assess the impact of vaccination under different levels of serotype-specific competition and illustrate the phenomenon of serotype replacement. The calibrated model is used to forecast the carriage prevalence in the pediatric cohort over 30 years.","1178":"Whole genome sequencing in conjunction with traditional epidemiology has been used to reconstruct transmission networks of Mycobacterium tuberculosis during outbreaks. Given its low mutation rate, genetic diversity within M. tuberculosis outbreaks can be extremely limited - making it difficult to determine precisely who transmitted to whom. In addition to consensus SNPs (cSNPs), examining heterogeneous alleles (hSNPs) has been proposed to improve resolution. However, few studies have examined the potential biases in detecting these hSNPs. Here, we analysed genome sequence data from 25 specimens from British Columbia, Canada. Specimens were sequenced to a depth of 112-296\u00d7. We observed biases in read depth, base quality, strand distribution and read placement where possible hSNPs were initially identified, so we applied conservative filters to reduce false positives. Overall, there was phylogenetic concordance between the observed 2542 cSNP and 63 hSNP loci. Furthermore, we identified hSNPs shared exclusively by epidemiologically linked patients, supporting their use in transmission inferences. We conclude that hSNPs may add resolution to transmission networks, particularly where the overall genetic diversity is low.","1179":"Among 59,794 residents and 16,572 staff, the estimated effectiveness of previous infection against omicron infection among unvaccinated persons who had been infected before or during the period of delta predominance ranged from 16.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.1 to 23.7) to 48.9% (95% CI, 41.6 to 55.3). Depending on previous infection status, the estimated effectiveness of vaccination (relative to being unvaccinated and without previous documented infection) ranged from 18.6% (95% CI, 7.7 to 28.1) to 83.2% (95% CI, 77.7 to 87.4) with two vaccine doses and from 40.9% (95% CI, 31.9 to 48.7) to 87.9% (95% CI, 76.0 to 93.9) with three vaccine doses. Incremental effectiveness estimates of a third (booster) dose (relative to two doses) ranged from 25.0% (95% CI, 16.6 to 32.5) to 57.9% (95% CI, 48.4 to 65.7) among persons who either had not had previous documented infection or had been infected before the period of delta predominance.We evaluated the protection conferred by mRNA vaccines and previous infection against infection with the omicron variant in two high-risk populations: residents and staff in the California state prison system. We used a retrospective cohort design to analyze the risk of infection during the omicron wave using data collected from December 24, 2021, through April 14, 2022. Weighted Cox models were used to compare the effectiveness (measured as 1 minus the hazard ratio) of vaccination and previous infection across combinations of vaccination history (stratified according to the number of mRNA doses received) and infection history (none or infection before or during the period of B.1.617.2 [delta]-variant predominance). A secondary analysis used a rolling matched-cohort design to evaluate the effectiveness of three vaccine doses as compared with two doses.Information regarding the protection conferred by vaccination and previous infection against infection with the B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is limited.Our findings in two high-risk populations suggest that mRNA vaccination and previous infection were effective against omicron infection, with lower estimates among those infected before the period of delta predominance. Three vaccine doses offered significantly more protection than two doses, including among previously infected persons.","1180":"Introduction. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to all antibiotic classes has been found in the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. The reported prevalence of these resistances varies, driven by within-host AMR evolution at the patient level, and between-host transmission at the hospital level. Without dense longitudinal sampling, pragmatic analysis of AMR dynamics at multiple levels using routine surveillance data is essential to inform control measures.Gap Statement. The value and limitations of routinely collected hospital data to gain insight into AMR dynamics at the hospital and individual levels simultaneously are unclear.Methodology. We explored S. aureus AMR diversity in 70\u200a000 isolates from a UK paediatric hospital between 2000-2021, using electronic datasets containing multiple routinely collected isolates per patient with phenotypic antibiograms and information on hospitalization and antibiotic consumption.Results. At the hospital level, the proportion of isolates that were meticillin-resistant (MRSA) increased between 2014-2020 from 25-50\u200a%, before sharply decreasing to 30%, likely due to a change in inpatient demographics. Temporal trends in the proportion of isolates resistant to different antibiotics were often correlated in MRSA, but independent in meticillin-susceptible S. aureus. Ciprofloxacin resistance in MRSA decreased from 70-40\u200a% of tested isolates between 2007-2020, likely linked to a national policy to reduce fluoroquinolone usage in 2007. At the patient level, we identified frequent AMR diversity, with 4\u200a% of patients ever positive for S. aureus simultaneously carrying, at some point, multiple isolates with different resistances. We detected changes over time in AMR diversity in 3\u200a% of patients ever positive for S. aureus. These changes equally represented gain and loss of resistance.Conclusion. Within this routinely collected dataset, we found that 65\u200a% of changes in resistance within a patient's S. aureus population could not be explained by antibiotic exposure or between-patient transmission of bacteria, suggesting that within-host evolution via frequent gain and loss of AMR genes may be responsible for these changing AMR profiles. Our study highlights the value of exploring existing routine surveillance data to determine underlying mechanisms of AMR. These insights may substantially improve our understanding of the importance of antibiotic exposure variation, and the success of single S. aureus clones.","1181":"We analyzed data from a cross-sectional survey conducted from April through June of 2020 linking risk factors for occupational and community exposure to COVID-19 with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. A multivariable logistic regression model was fit to quantify risk factors for infection. Participants were employees and medical staff members who elected to participate in SARS-CoV-2 serology testing offered to all healthcare workers as part of a quality initiative, and who completed a survey on exposure to COVID-19 and use of personal protective equipment. Exposures of interest included known demographic risk factors for COVID-19, residential zip code incidence of COVID-19, occupational exposure to PCR test-positive healthcare workers or patients, and use of personal protective equipment. The primary outcome of interest was SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity.Quantifying occupational risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers can inform efforts to improve healthcare worker and patient safety and reduce transmission. This study aimed to quantify demographic, occupational, and community risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among healthcare workers in a large metropolitan healthcare system.SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was estimated to be 5.7% (95% CI: 5.2%-6.1%) among 10,275 healthcare workers. Community contact with a person known or suspected to have COVID-19 (aOR=1.9, 95% CI:1.4-2.5) and zip code level COVID-19 incidence (aOR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0-2.0) increased the odds of infection. Black individuals were at high risk (aOR=2.0, 95% CI:1.6-2.4). Overall, occupational risk factors accounted for 27% (95% CI: 25%-30%) of the risk among healthcare workers and included contact with a PCR test-positive healthcare worker (aOR=1.2, 95% CI:1.0-1.6).Community risk factors, including contact with a COVID-19 positive individual and residential COVID-19 incidence, are more strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among healthcare workers than exposure in the workplace.","1182":"Social networks provide an established tool to implement heterogeneous contact structures in epidemiological models. Dynamic temporal changes in contact structure and ranging behaviour of wildlife may impact disease dynamics. A consensus has yet to emerge, however, concerning the conditions in which network dynamics impact model outcomes, as compared to static approximations that average contact rates over longer time periods. Furthermore, as many pathogens can be transmitted both environmentally and via close contact, it is important to investigate the relative influence of both transmission routes in real-world populations. Here, we use empirically derived networks from a population of wild primates, Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi), and simulated networks to investigate pathogen spread in dynamic vs. static social networks. First, we constructed a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model of Cryptosporidium spread in wild Verreaux's sifakas. We incorporated social and environmental transmission routes and parameterized the model for two different climatic seasons. Second, we used simulated networks and greater variation in epidemiological parameters to investigate the conditions in which dynamic networks produce larger outbreak sizes than static networks. We found that average outbreak size of Cryptosporidium infections in sifakas was larger when the disease was introduced in the dry season than in the wet season, driven by an increase in home range overlap towards the end of the dry season. Regardless of season, dynamic networks always produced larger average outbreak sizes than static networks. Larger outbreaks in dynamic models based on simulated networks occurred especially when the probability of transmission and recovery were low. Variation in tie strength in the dynamic networks also had a major impact on outbreak size, while network modularity had a weaker influence than epidemiological parameters that determine transmission and recovery. Our study adds to emerging evidence that dynamic networks can change predictions of disease dynamics, especially if the disease shows low transmissibility and a long infectious period, and when environmental conditions lead to enhanced between-group contact after an infectious agent has been introduced.","1183":"In 2023, a series of climatological and political events unfolded, partly driving forward the global climate and health agenda while simultaneously exposing important disparities and vulnerabilities to climate-related events. On the policy front, a significant step forward was marked by the inaugural Health Day at COP28, acknowledging the profound impacts of climate change on health. However, the first-ever Global Stocktake showed an important gap between the current progress and the targets outlined in the Paris Agreement, underscoring the urgent need for further and decisive action. From a Latin American perspective, some questions arise: How do we achieve the change that is needed? How to address the vulnerabilities to climate change in a region with long-standing social inequities? How do we promote intersectoral collaboration to face a complex problem such as climate change? The debate is still ongoing, and in many instances, it is just starting. The renamed regional centre Lancet Countdown Latin America (previously named Lancet Countdown South America) expanded its geographical scope adding Mexico and five Central American countries: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama, as a response to the need for stronger collaboration in a region with significant social disparities, including research capacities and funding. The centre is an independent and multidisciplinary collaboration that tracks the links between health and climate change in Latin America, following the global Lancet Countdown's methodologies and five domains. The Lancet Countdown Latin America work hinges on the commitment of 23 regional academic institutions, United Nations agencies, and 34 researchers who generously contribute their time and expertise. Building from the first report, the 2023 report of the Lancet Countdown Latin America, presents 34 indicators that track the relationship between health and climate change up to 2022, aiming at providing evidence to public decision-making with the purpose of improving the health and wellbeing of Latin American populations and reducing social inequities through climate actions focusing on health. This report shows that Latin American populations continue to observe a growing exposure to changing climatic conditions. A warming trend has been observed across all countries in Latin America, with severe direct impacts. In 2022, people were exposed to ambient temperatures, on average, 0.38\u00a0\u00b0C higher than in 1986-2005, with Paraguay experiencing the highest anomaly (+1.9\u00a0\u00b0C), followed by Argentina (+1.2\u00a0\u00b0C) and Uruguay (+0.9\u00a0\u00b0C) (indicator 1.1.1). In 2013-2022, infants were exposed to 248% more heatwave days and people over 65 years old were exposed to 271% more heatwave days than in 1986-2005 (indicator 1.1.2). Also, compared to 1991-2000, in 2013-2022, there were 256 and 189 additional annual hours per person, during which ambient heat posed at least moderate and high risk of heat stress during light outdoor physical activity in Latin America, respectively (indicator 1.1.3). Finally, the region had a 140% increase in heat-related mortality from 2000-2009 to 2013-2022 (indicator 1.1.4). Changes in ecosystems have led to an increased risk of wildfires, exposing individuals to very or extremely high fire danger for more extended periods (indicator 1.2.1). Additionally, the transmission potential for dengue by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes has risen by 54% from 1951-1960 to 2013-2022 (indicator 1.3), which aligns with the recent outbreaks and increasing dengue cases observed across Latin America in recent months. Based on the 2023 report of the Lancet Countdown Latin America, there are three key messages that Latin America needs to further explore and advance for a health-centred climate-resilient development. Latin American countries require intersectoral public policies that simultaneously increase climate resilience, reduce social inequities, improve population health, and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The findings show that adaptation policies in Latin America remain weak, with a pressing need for robust vulnerability and adaptation (V&A) assessments to address climate risks effectively. Unfortunately, such assessments are scarce. Up to 2021, Brazil is the only country that has completed and officially reported a V&A to the 2021 Global Survey conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO). Argentina, Guatemala, and Panama have also conducted them, but they have not been reported (indicator 2.1.1). Similarly, efforts in developing and implementing Health National Adaptation Plans (HNAPs) are varied and limited in scope. Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay are the only countries that have an HNAP (indicator 2.1.2). Moreover, self-reported city-level climate change risk assessments are very limited in the region (indicator 2.1.3). The collaboration between meteorological and health sectors remains insufficient, with only Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Guatemala self-reporting some level of integration (indicator 2.2.1), hindering comprehensive responses to climate-related health risks in the region. Additionally, despite the urgent need for action, there has been minimal progress in increasing urban greenspaces across the region since 2015, with only Colombia, Nicaragua, and Venezuela showing slight improvements (indicator 2.2.2). Compounding these challenges is the decrease in funding for climate change adaptation projects in Latin America, as evidenced by the 16% drop in funds allocated by the Green Climate Fund (GCF) in 2022 compared to 2021. Alarmingly, none of the funds approved in 2022 were directed toward climate change and health projects, highlighting a critical gap in addressing health-related climate risks (indicator 2.2.3). From a vulnerability perspective, the Mosquito Risk Index (MoRI) indicates an overall decrease in severe mosquito-borne disease risk in the region due to improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) (indicator 2.3.1). Brazil and Paraguay were the only countries that showed an increase in this indicator. It is worth noting that significant temporal variation within and between countries still persists, suggesting inadequate preparedness for climate-related changes. Overall, population health is not solely determined by the health sector, nor are climate policies a sole responsibility of the environmental sector. More and stronger intersectoral collaboration is needed to pave development pathways that consider solid adaptation to climate change, greater reductions of GHG emissions, and that increase social equity and population health. These policies involve sectors such as finance, transport, energy, housing, health, and agriculture, requiring institutional structures and policy instruments that allow long-term intersectoral collaboration. Latin American countries need to accelerate an energy transition that prioritises people's health and wellbeing, reduces energy poverty and air pollution, and maximises health and economic gains. In Latin America, there is a notable disparity in energy transition, with electricity generation from coal increasing by an average of 2.6% from 1991-2000 to 2011-2020, posing a challenge to efforts aimed at phasing out coal (indicator 3.1.1). However, this percentage increase is conservative as it may not include all the fossil fuels for thermoelectric electricity generation, especially during climate-related events and when hydropower is affected (Panel 4). Yet, renewable energy sources have been growing, increasing by an average of 5.7% during the same period. Access to clean fuels for cooking remains a concern, with 46.3% of the rural population in Central America and 23.3% in South America lacking access to clean fuels in 2022 (indicator 3.1.2). It is crucial to highlight the concerning overreliance on fossil fuels, particularly liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), as a primary cooking fuel. A significant majority of Latin American populations, approximately 74.6%, rely on LPG for cooking. Transitioning to cleaner heating and cooking alternatives could also have a health benefit by reducing household air pollution-related mortality. Fossil fuels continue to dominate road transport energy in Latin America, accounting for 96%, although some South American countries are increasing the use of biofuels (indicator 3.1.3). Premature mortality attributable to fossil-fuel-derived PM2.5 has shown varied trends across countries, increasing by 3.9% from 2005 to 2020 across Latin America, which corresponds to 123.5 premature deaths per million people (indicator 3.2.1). The Latin American countries with the highest premature mortality rate attributable to PM2.5 in 2020 were Chile, Peru, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Paraguay. Of the total premature deaths attributable to PM2.5 in 2020, 19.1% was from transport, 12.3% from households, 11.6% from industry, and 11% from agriculture. From emission and capture of GHG perspective, commodity-driven deforestation and expansion of agricultural land remain major contributors to tree cover loss in the region, accounting for around 80% of the total loss (indicator 3.3). Additionally, animal-based food production in Latin America contributes 85% to agricultural CO2 equivalent emissions, with Argentina, Brazil, Panama, Paraguay, and Uruguay ranking highest in per capita emissions (indicator 3.4.1). From a health perspective, in 2020, approximately 870,000 deaths were associated with imbalanced diets, of which 155,000 (18%) were linked to high intake of red and processed meat and dairy products (indicator 3.4.2). Energy transition in Latin America is still in its infancy, and as a result, millions of people are currently exposed to dangerous levels of air pollution and energy poverty (i.e., lack of access to essential energy sources or services). As shown in this report, the levels of air pollution, outdoors and indoors, are a significant problem in the whole region, with marked disparities between urban and rural areas. In 2022, Peru, Chile, Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, El Salvador, Brazil, Uruguay, Honduras, Panama, and Nicaragua were in the top 100 most polluted countries globally. Transitioning to cleaner sources of energy, phasing out fossil fuels, and promoting better energy efficiency in the industrial and housing sectors are not only climate mitigation measures but also huge health and economic opportunities for more prosperous and healthy societies. Latin American countries need to increase climate finance through permanent fiscal commitments and multilateral development banks to pave climate-resilient development pathways. Climate change poses significant economic costs, with investments in mitigation and adaptation measures progressing slowly. In 2022, economic losses due to weather-related extreme events in Latin America were US$15.6 billion -an amount mainly driven by floods and landslides in Brazil-representing 0.28% of Latin America's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (indicator 4.1.1). In contrast to high-income countries, most of these losses lack insurance coverage, imposing a substantial financial strain on affected families and governments. Heat-related mortality among individuals aged 65 and older in Latin America reached alarming levels, with losses exceeding the equivalent of the average income of 451,000 people annually (indicator 4.1.2). Moreover, the total potential income loss due to heat-related labour capacity reduction amounted to 1.34% of regional GDP, disproportionately affecting the agriculture and construction sectors (indicator 4.1.3). Additionally, the economic toll of premature mortality from air pollution was substantial, equivalent to a significant portion of regional GDP (0.61%) (indicator 4.1.4). On a positive note, clean energy investments in the region increased in 2022, surpassing fossil fuel investments. However, in 2020, all countries reviewed continued to offer net-negative carbon prices, revealing fossil fuel subsidies totalling US$23 billion. Venezuela had the highest net subsidies relative to current health expenditure (123%), followed by Argentina (10.5%), Bolivia (10.3%), Ecuador (8.3%), and Chile (5.6%) (indicator 4.2.1). Fossil fuel-based energy is today more expensive than renewable energy. Fossil fuel burning drives climate change and damages the environment on which people depend, and air pollution derived from the burning of fossil fuels causes seven million premature deaths each year worldwide, along with a substantial burden of disease. Transitioning to sustainable, zero-emission energy sources, fostering healthier food systems, and expediting adaptation efforts promise not only environmental benefits but also significant economic gains. However, to implement mitigation and adaptation policies that also improve social wellbeing and prosperity, stronger and solid financial systems are needed. Climate finance in Latin American countries is scarce and strongly depends on political cycles, which threatens adequate responses to the current and future challenges. Progress on the climate agenda is lagging behind the urgent pace required. While engagement with the intersection of health and climate change is increasing, government involvement remains inadequate. Newspaper coverage of health and climate change has been on the rise, peaking in 2022, yet the proportion of climate change articles discussing health has declined over time (indicator 5.1). Although there has been significant growth in the number of scientific papers focusing on Latin America, it still represents less than 4% of global publications on the subject (indicator 5.3). And, while health was mentioned by most Latin American countries at the UN General Debate in 2022, only a few addressed the intersection of health and climate change, indicating a lack of awareness at the governmental level (indicator 5.4). The 2023 Lancet Countdown Latin America report underscores the cascading and compounding health impacts of anthropogenic climate change, marked by increased exposure to heatwaves, wildfires, and vector-borne diseases. Specifically, for Latin America, the report emphasises three critical messages: the urgent action to implement intersectoral public policies that enhance climate resilience across the region; the pressing need to prioritise an energy transition that focuses on health co-benefits and wellbeing, and lastly, that need for increasing climate finance by committing to sustained fiscal efforts and engaging with multilateral development banks. By understanding the problems, addressing the gaps, and taking decisive action, Latin America can navigate the challenges of climate change, fostering a more sustainable and resilient future for its population.

These were issued by 15 different forecasting models, run by independent research teams. Moreover, we study the performance of combined ensemble forecasts. Evaluation of probabilistic forecasts is based on proper scoring rules, along with interval coverage proportions to assess calibration. The presented work is part of a pre-registered evaluation study.Multi-model approaches can help to improve the performance of epidemiological forecasts. However, while death numbers can be predicted with some success based on current case and hospitalization data, predictability of case numbers remains low beyond quite short time horizons. Additional data sources including sequencing and mobility data, which were not extensively used in the present study, may help to improve performance.We find that many, though not all, models outperform a simple baseline model up to four weeks ahead for the considered targets. Ensemble methods show very good relative performance. The addressed time period is characterized by rather stable non-pharmaceutical interventions in both countries, making short-term predictions more straightforward than in previous periods. However, major trend changes in reported cases, like the rebound in cases due to the rise of the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant in March 2021, prove challenging to predict.During the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a strong interest in forecasts of the short-term development of epidemiological indicators to inform decision makers. In this study we evaluate probabilistic real-time predictions of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 in Germany and Poland for the period from January through April 2021.","1185":"Children with neurologic disorders are at high risk for influenza-associated complications. We identified 184,460 children 1-17 years of age with neurologic disorders and 204,966 siblings in a commercial insurance claims database from July 2006 to June 2014. Among children with neurologic disorders, coverage increased from 22.4% in 2006-2007 to 42.3% in 2013-2014, but remained suboptimal. A lower proportion of siblings were vaccinated.","1186":"Infectious diseases are a significant burden in global healthcare. Pathogens engage with different host defense mechanisms. However, it is currently unknown if there are disease-specific immune signatures and\/or if different pathogens elicit common immune-associated molecular entities to common therapeutic interventions. We studied patients enrolled through the Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC), which focuses on immune responses to various infections. Blood samples were collected and analyzed from patients during infection and follow-up time points at the convalescent stage. The study included samples from patients with Lyme disease (LD), tuberculosis (TB), malaria (MLA), dengue virus (DENV), and West Nile virus (WNV), as well as kidney transplant patients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) and polyomavirus (BKV) infections. Using an antibody-based assay, we quantified\u2009~\u2009350 cell surface markers, cytokines, and chemokines involved in inflammation and immunity. Unique protein signatures were identified specific to the acute phase of infection irrespective of the pathogen type, with significant changes during convalescence. In addition, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6 (TNR6), C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 7 (CCR7), and C-C motif chemokine ligand-1 (CCL1) were increased in the acute and convalescent phases across all viral, bacterial, and protozoan compared to blood from healthy donors. Furthermore, despite the differences between pathogens, proteins were enriched in common biological pathways such as cell surface receptor signaling pathway and response to external stimulus. In conclusion, we demonstrated that irrespective of the pathogen type, there are common immunoregulatory and proinflammatory signals.","1187":"A stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial (CRT) is a unidirectional crossover study in which timings of treatment initiation for clusters are randomized. Because the timing of treatment initiation is different for each cluster, an emerging question is whether the treatment effect depends on the exposure time, namely, the time duration since the initiation of treatment. Existing approaches for assessing exposure-time treatment effect heterogeneity either assume a parametric functional form of exposure time or model the exposure time as a categorical variable, in which case the number of parameters increases with the number of exposure-time periods, leading to a potential loss in efficiency. In this article, we propose a new model formulation for assessing treatment effect heterogeneity over exposure time. Rather than a categorical term for each level of exposure time, the proposed model includes a random effect to represent varying treatment effects by exposure time. This allows for pooling information across exposure-time periods and may result in more precise average and exposure-time-specific treatment effect estimates. In addition, we develop an accompanying permutation test for the variance component of the heterogeneous treatment effect parameters. We conduct simulation studies to compare the proposed model and permutation test to alternative methods to elucidate their finite-sample operating characteristics, and to generate practical guidance on model choices for assessing exposure-time treatment effect heterogeneity in stepped-wedge\u00a0CRTs.","1188":"Empirically demonstrated improvements in the PrEP continuum of care in response to existing interventions can substantially reduce incident HIV infections among adolescent sexual minority males.As compared to no PrEP use, baseline PrEP adherence and retention among adolescent sexual minority males drawn from the ATN113 and Enhancing Preexposure Prophylaxis in Community studies averted from 2.8% to 41.0% of HIV infections depending on the fraction of eligible adolescent sexual minority males that initiated PrEP at their annual health-care visit. Improved adherence and retention achieved with an array of focused interventions from real-world settings increased the percent of infections averted by as much as 26%-70%.Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)-an effective and safe intervention to prevent HIV transmission-was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use by adolescents. Informed by studies of sexual behavior and PrEP adherence, retention, and promotion, we model the potential impact of PrEP use among at-risk adolescent sexual minority males.We simulate an HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) aged 13-39. We assume adult MSM ages 19-39 have had PrEP available for 3 years with 20% coverage among eligible MSM based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. PrEP interventions for ages 16-18 are then simulated using adherence and retention profiles drawn from the ATN113 and Enhancing Preexposure Prophylaxis in Community studies across a range of uptake parameters (10%-100%). Partnerships across age groups were modeled using parameterizations from the RADAR study. We compare the percent of incident infections averted (impact), person-years on PrEP per infection averted (efficiency), and changes in prevalence over 10\u00a0years.","1189":"Trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV3s) protect against 2 A strains and one B lineage; quadrivalent versions (IIV4s) protect against an additional B lineage. The objective was to assess projected health and economic outcomes associated with IIV4\u00a0versus IIV3 for preventing seasonal influenza in the US. A cost-effectiveness model was developed to interact with a dynamic transmission model. The transmission model tracked vaccination, influenza cases, infection-spreading interactions, and recovery over 10 y (2012-2022). The cost-effectiveness model estimated influenza-related complications, direct and indirect costs (2013-2014 US$), health outcomes, and cost-effectiveness. Inputs were taken from published\/public sources or estimated using regression or calibration. Outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. Scenario analyses tested the reliability of the results. Seasonal vaccination with IIV4 versus IIV3 is predicted to reduce annual influenza cases by 1,973,849 (discounted; 2,325,644 undiscounted), resulting in 12-13% fewer cases and influenza-related complications and deaths. These reductions are predicted to translate into 18,485 more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) accrued annually for IIV4\u00a0versus IIV3. Increased vaccine-related costs ($599 million; 5.7%) are predicted to be more than offset by reduced influenza treatment costs ($699 million; 12.2%), resulting in direct medical cost saving annually ($100 million; 0.6%). Including indirect costs, savings with IIV4 are predicted to be $7.1 billion (5.6%). Scenario analyses predict IIV4 to be cost-saving in all scenarios tested apart from low infectivity, where IIV4 is predicted to be cost-effective. In summary, seasonal influenza vaccination in the US with IIV4 versus IIV3 is predicted to improve health outcomes and reduce costs.","1190":"Improve models for estimating HIV epidemic trends in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).The r-hybrid and r-spline models typically provided similar HIV prevalence trends, but sometimes qualitatively different assessments of recent incidence trends because of different structural assumptions about the HIV transmission rate. The r-hybrid model had the lowest average continuous ranked probability score, indicating the best model predictions. Coverage of 95% posterior predictive intervals was 91.5% for the r-hybrid model, versus 87.2 and 85.5% for r-spline and r-trend, respectively.Mathematical epidemic model fit to national HIV survey and ANC sentinel surveillance (ANC-SS) data.The EPP-ASM and r-hybrid models improve consistency of EPP and Spectrum, improve the epidemiological assumptions underpinning recent HIV incidence estimates, and improve estimates and short-term projections of HIV prevalence trends. Countries that use general population survey and ANC-SS data to estimate HIV epidemic trends should consider using these tools.We modified EPP to incorporate age and sex stratification (EPP-ASM) to more accurately capture the shifting demographics of maturing HIV epidemics. Secondly, we developed a new functional form for the HIV transmission rate, termed 'r-hybrid', which combines a four-parameter logistic function for the initial epidemic growth, peak, and decline followed by a first-order random walk for recent trends after epidemic stabilization. We fitted the r-hybrid model along with previously developed r-spline and r-trend models to HIV prevalence data from household surveys and ANC-SS in 177 regions in 34 SSA countries. We used leave-one-out cross validation with household survey HIV prevalence to compare model predictions.","1191":"H3N2 viruses continuously acquire mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein that abrogate binding of human antibodies. During the 2014-2015 influenza season, clade 3C.2a H3N2 viruses possessing a new predicted glycosylation site in antigenic site B of HA emerged, and these viruses remain prevalent today. The 2016-2017 seasonal influenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3C.2a H3N2 strain; however, the egg-adapted version of this viral strain lacks the new putative glycosylation site. Here, we biochemically demonstrate that the HA antigenic site B of circulating clade 3C.2a viruses is glycosylated. We show that antibodies elicited in ferrets and humans exposed to the egg-adapted 2016-2017 H3N2 vaccine strain poorly neutralize a glycosylated clade 3C.2a H3N2 virus. Importantly, antibodies elicited in ferrets infected with the current circulating H3N2 viral strain (that possesses the glycosylation site) and humans vaccinated with baculovirus-expressed H3 antigens (that possess the glycosylation site motif) were able to efficiently recognize a glycosylated clade 3C.2a H3N2 virus. We propose that differences in glycosylation between H3N2 egg-adapted vaccines and circulating strains likely contributed to reduced vaccine effectiveness during the 2016-2017 influenza season. Furthermore, our data suggest that influenza virus antigens prepared via systems not reliant on egg adaptations are more likely to elicit protective antibody responses that are not affected by glycosylation of antigenic site B of H3N2 HA.","1192":"Automatic car counting is an important component in the automated traffic system. Car counting is very important to understand the traffic load and optimize the traffic signals. In this paper, we implemented the Gaussian Background Subtraction Method and OverFeat Framework to count cars. OverFeat Framework is a combination of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and one machine learning classifier (like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Logistic Regression). With this study, we showed another possible application area for the OverFeat Framework. The advantages and shortcomings of the Background Subtraction Method and OverFeat Framework were analyzed using six individual traffic videos with different perspectives, such as camera angles, weather conditions and time of the day. In addition, we compared the two algorithms above with manual counting and a commercial software called Placemeter. The OverFeat Framework showed significant potential in the field of car counting with the average accuracy of 96.55% in our experiment.","1193":"Honeybee declines are a serious threat to global agricultural security and productivity. Although multiple factors contribute to these declines, parasites are a key driver. Disease problems in honeybees have intensified in recent years, despite increasing attention to addressing them. Here we argue that we must focus on the principles of disease ecology and evolution to understand disease dynamics, assess the severity of disease threats, and control these threats via honeybee management. We cover the ecological context of honeybee disease, including both host and parasite factors driving current transmission dynamics, and then discuss evolutionary dynamics including how beekeeping management practices may drive selection for more virulent parasites. We then outline how ecological and evolutionary principles can guide disease mitigation in honeybees, including several practical management suggestions for addressing short- and long-term disease dynamics and consequences.","1194":"When a novel pathogen emerges there may be opportunities to eliminate transmission - locally or globally - whilst case numbers are low. However, the effort required to push a disease to elimination may come at a vast cost at a time when uncertainty is high. Models currently inform policy discussions on this question, but there are a number of open challenges, particularly given unknown aspects of the pathogen biology, the effectiveness and feasibility of interventions, and the intersecting political, economic, sociological and behavioural complexities for a novel pathogen. In this overview, we detail how models might identify directions for better leveraging or expanding the scope of data available on the pathogen trajectory, for bounding the theoretical context of emergence relative to prospects for elimination, and for framing the larger economic,\u00a0behavioural and social context that will influence policy decisions and the pathogen's outcome.","1195":"The invasion ecology principles illustrated in many ecosystems have not yet been explored in the context of fomite transmission. We hypothesized that invaders in fomite transmission are trackable, are neutrally distributed between hands and environmental surfaces, and exhibit a proximity effect. To test this hypothesis, a surrogate invader, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, was spread by a root carrier in an office housing more than 20 participants undertaking normal activities, and the microbiotas on skin and environmental surfaces were analyzed before and after invasion. First, we found that the invader was trackable. Its identity and emission source could be determined using microbial-interaction networks, and the root carrier could be identified using a rank analysis. Without prior information, L. bulgaricus could be identified as the invader emitted from a source that exclusively contained the invader, and the probable root carrier could be located. In addition to the single-taxon invasion by L. bulgaricus, multiple-taxon invasion was observed, as genera from sputum\/saliva exhibited co-occurrence relationships on skin and environmental surfaces. Second, the invader had a below-neutral distribution in a neutral community model, suggesting that hands accrued heavier invader contamination than environmental surfaces. Third, a proximity effect was observed on a surface touch network. Invader contamination on surfaces decreased with increasing geodesic distance from the hands of the carrier, indicating that the carrier's touching behaviors were the main driver of fomite transmission. Taken together, these results demonstrate the invasion ecology principles in fomite transmission and provide a general basis for the management of ecological fomite transmission. IMPORTANCE Fomite transmission contributes to the spread of many infectious diseases. However, pathogens in fomite transmission typically are either investigated individually without considering the context of native microbiotas or investigated in a nondiscriminatory way from the dispersal of microbiotas. In this study, we adopted an invasion ecology framework in which we considered pathogens as invaders, the surface environment as an ecosystem, and human behaviors as the driver of microbial dispersal. With this approach, we assessed the ability of quantitative ecological theories to track and forecast pathogen movements in fomite transmission. By uncovering the relationships between the invader and native microbiotas and between human behaviors and invader\/microbiota dispersal, we demonstrated that fomite transmission follows idiosyncratic invasion ecology principles. Our findings suggest that attempts to manage fomite transmission for public health purposes should focus on the microbial communities and anthropogenic factors involved, in addition to the pathogens.","1196":"For an RSV EHL-mAb with 70% efficacy, 6-18 infants would need to be immunized to prevent one RSV-associated outpatient visit, and 13-33 infants would need to be immunized to prevent one RSV-associated LRI outpatient visit. To prevent one RSV-associated hospitalization, 37-85 infants 0-5\u00a0months of age, and 107-280 infants 6-11\u00a0months of age would need to be immunized.We combined RSV hospitalization, outpatient and outpatient lower respiratory tract infection (LRI) incidence estimates and a range of immunization efficacies to estimate the annual NNI. We calculated the absolute incidence rate reduction (ARR) by multiplying the incidence rates by immunization efficacy. NNI was calculated as the reciprocal of the ARR.Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most important respiratory pathogens in young children. Infants <6\u00a0months of age and infants and young children with extreme pre-term birth, and cardiac and pulmonary co-morbidities experience the highest incidence of severe RSV disease. There are no licensed vaccines; immunoprophylaxis is recommended for the highest risk children. Extended half-life RSV monoclonal antibodies (EHL-mAbs) are under development intended for immunization of all infants and high-risk children <2\u00a0years of age. We modeled the anticipated public health benefits of RSV EHL-mAb immunization using the number needed to immunize (NNI).Public health benefits, such as disease cases averted due to immunization, are essential elements in consideration of candidate vaccines for a national immunization program. An RSV EHL-mAb of moderate efficacy could have high impact. These data provide an additional perspective for public health decision making.","1197":"Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs), aimed at reducing the diffusion of the COVID-19 pandemic, have dramatically influenced our everyday behaviour. In this work, we study how individuals adapted their daily movements and person-to-person contact patterns over time in response to the NPIs. We leverage longitudinal GPS mobility data of hundreds of thousands of anonymous individuals to empirically show and quantify the dramatic disruption in people's mobility habits and social behaviour. We find that local interventions did not just impact the number of visits to different venues but also how people experience them. Individuals spend less time in venues, preferring simpler and more predictable routines, also reducing person-to-person contacts. Moreover, we find that the individual patterns of visits are influenced by the strength of the NPIs policies, the local severity of the pandemic and a risk adaptation factor, which increases the people's mobility regardless of the stringency of interventions. Finally, despite the gradual recovery in visit patterns, we find that individuals continue to keep person-to-person contacts low. This apparent conflict hints that the evolution of policy adherence should be carefully addressed by policymakers, epidemiologists and mobility experts.","1198":"Reported rates of invasive pneumococcal disease were markedly lower than normal during the 2020\/2021 winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the first year after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known about rates of carriage of pneumococcus among adults during this period. Between October 2020-August 2021, couples in the Greater New Haven Area, USA, were enrolled if both individuals were aged 60\u2009years and above and did not have any individuals under the age of 60\u2009years living in the household. Saliva samples and questionnaires regarding social activities and contacts and medical history were obtained every 2\u2009weeks for a period of 10\u2009weeks. Following culture-enrichment, extracted DNA was tested using qPCR for pneumococcus-specific sequences piaB and lytA. Individuals were considered positive for pneumococcal carriage when Ct values for piaB were \u226440. Results. We collected 567 saliva samples from 95 individuals (47 household pairs and 1 singleton). Of those, 7.1% of samples tested positive for pneumococcus, representing 22\/95 (23.2%) individuals and 16\/48 (33.3%) households. Study participants attended few social events during this period. However, many participants continued to have regular contact with children. Individuals who had regular contact with preschool and school-aged children (i.e., 2 to 9\u2009year olds) had a higher prevalence of carriage (15.9% versus 5.4%). Despite COVID-19-related disruptions, a large proportion of older adults continued to carry pneumococcus. Prevalence was particularly high among those who had contact with school-aged children, but carriage was not limited to this group. IMPORTANCE Carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) in the upper respiratory tract is considered a prerequisite to invasive pneumococcal disease. During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, markedly lower rates of invasive pneumococcal disease were reported worldwide. Despite this, by testing saliva samples with PCR, we found that older adults continued to carry pneumococcus at pre-pandemic levels. Importantly, this study was conducted during a period when transmission mitigation measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic were in place. However, our observations are in line with reports from Israel and Belgium where carriage was also found to persist in children. In line with this, we observed that carriage prevalence was particularly high among the older adults in our study who maintained contact with school-aged children.","1199":" and farms located at a range within 0.5\u00a0km and 0.7\u00a0km from major roads were more likely to be infected by PRRSV, whereas farms at an elevation of 41 to 61 meters and surrounded by denser vegetation were less likely to be infected, indicating their role as dissemination barriers. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that external dissemination was intense, and reinforce the importance of farm proximity on PRRSV spread. Thus, consideration of farm location, geographic characteristics and animal densities across production systems may help to forecast PRRSV collateral dissemination.","1200":"We found no CpG loci associated with 0-18 week GWG after adjusting for the set of covariates used in the ALSPAC study (i.e. child's sex and maternal age) and for multiple testing (q > 0.9, both 1,505 and 473,731 tests). Hence, none of the CpG loci linked with the genes found significantly associated with 0-18 week GWG in the ALSPAC study were significant in our study.Several epidemiologic studies indicate that maternal gestational weight gain (GWG) influences health outcomes in offspring. Any underlying mechanisms have, however, not been established. A recent study of 88 children based on the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort examined the methylation levels at 1,505 Cytosine-Guanine methylation (CpG) loci and found several to be significantly associated with maternal weight gain between weeks 0 and 18 of gestation. Since these results could not be replicated we wanted to examine associations between 0 and 18 week GWG and genome-wide methylation levels using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450K) platform on a larger sample size, i.e. 729 newborns sampled from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa).The inconsistency in the results with the ALSPAC study with regards to the 0-18 week GWG model may arise for several reasons: sampling from different populations, dissimilar methylome coverage, sample size and\/or false positive findings.","1201":"Many of the world's vaccine supply chains do not adequately provide vaccines, prompting several questions: how are vaccine supply chains currently structured, are these structures closely tailored to individual countries, and should these supply chains be radically redesigned?The majority of supply chains (34 of 57) consist of four levels, despite serving a wide diversity of geographical areas and population sizes. These four-level supply chains loosely fall into three clusters [(1) 18 countries relatively more bottom-heavy, i.e., many more storage locations lower in the supply chain, (2) seven with relatively more storage locations in both top and lower levels, and (3) nine comparatively more top-heavy] which do not correlate closely with any of the country characteristics considered. For all three cluster types, our HERMES modeling found that simplified systems (a central location shipping directly to immunization locations with a limited number of Hubs in between) resulted in lower operating costs.We segmented the 57 GAVI-eligible countries' vaccine supply chains based on their structure\/morphology, analyzed whether these segments correlated with differences in country characteristics, and then utilized HERMES to develop a detailed simulation model of three sample countries' supply chains and explore the cost and impact of various alternative structures.A standard four-tier design template may have been followed for most countries and raises the possibility that simpler and more tailored designs may be warranted.","1202":") indicate that the model offers much to livestock vaccination modeling among small-scale herders.","1203":"A total of 48,898 outpatient visits were recorded across the two sites over the study period. HMIS incidence correlated with cohort incidence over time at both study sites (correlation in Kihihi\u2009=\u20090.64, p\u2009<\u20090.001; correlation in Nagongera\u2009=\u20090.34, p\u2009=\u20090.045). HMIS incidence measures with denominators unweighted by probability of attendance underestimated cohort incidence aggregated over the 3\u00a0years in Kihihi (0.5 cases per person-year (PPY) vs 1.7 cases PPY) and Nagongera (0.3 cases PPY vs 3.0 cases PPY). HMIS incidence measures with denominators weighted by probability of attendance were closer to cohort incidence, but remained underestimates (1.1 cases PPY in Kihihi and 1.4 cases PPY in Nagongera).Outpatient data from two public health facilities in Uganda (Kihihi and Nagongera) over a 3-year period (2011-2014) were used to model the relationship between travel time from patient village of residence (available for each individual) to the facility and the relative probability of attendance using Poisson generalized additive models. Outputs from the model were used to generate a weighted population denominator for each health facility and estimate malaria incidence. Among children aged 6\u00a0months to 11\u00a0years, monthly HMIS-derived incidence estimates, with and without population denominators weighted by probability of attendance, were compared with gold standard measures of malaria incidence measured in prospective cohorts.Accurate measures of malaria incidence are essential to track progress and target high-risk populations. While health management information system (HMIS) data provide counts of malaria cases, quantifying the denominator for incidence using these data is challenging because catchment areas and care-seeking behaviours are not well defined. This study's aim was to estimate malaria incidence using HMIS data by adjusting the population denominator accounting for travel time to the health facility.Although malaria incidence measured using HMIS underestimated incidence measured in cohorts, even when adjusting for probability of attendance, HMIS surveillance data are a promising and scalable source for tracking relative changes in malaria incidence over time, particularly when the population denominator can be estimated by incorporating information on village of residence.","1204":"Modern HIV research depends crucially on both viral sequencing and population measurements. To directly link mechanistic biological processes and evolutionary dynamics during HIV infection, we developed multiple within-host phylodynamic models of HIV primary infection for comparative validation against viral load and evolutionary dynamics data. The optimal model of primary infection required no positive selection, suggesting that the host adaptive immune system reduces viral load but surprisingly does not drive observed viral evolution. Rather, the fitness (infectivity) of mutant variants is drawn from an exponential distribution in which most variants are slightly less infectious than their parents (nearly neutral evolution). This distribution was not largely different from either in\u00a0vivo fitness distributions recorded beyond primary infection or in\u00a0vitro distributions that are observed without adaptive immunity, suggesting the intrinsic viral fitness distribution may drive evolution. Simulated phylogenetic trees also agree with independent data and illuminate how phylogenetic inference must consider viral and immune-cell population dynamics to gain accurate mechanistic insights.","1205":"Monitoring HPV antibodies non-invasively would be a major advantage for large epidemiological studies and follow-up of vaccinees.In this case-control study, 55 paired first-void urine and serum samples were included from 19- to 26-year-old women, unvaccinated (n\u2009=\u200919) or vaccinated (n\u2009=\u200936) with the bi- or quadrivalent HPV vaccine during adolescence (NCT02714114). Human IgA, total human IgG, and HPV6\/11\/16\/18-Ig(M\/G\/A) were measured in paired samples.This study investigated the presence of HPV-specific antibody transudates from systemic circulation in first-void urine of (un)vaccinated subjects and the agreement with paired sera.\u2009=\u20090.636 (p\u2009<\u20090.001)). In both first-void urine and serum, significantly higher HPV6\/11\/16\/18 antibody levels were observed in vaccinated compared with unvaccinated women (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.017).The present study provides the first proof that vaccine-induced HPV antibodies are detectable in the first-void urine of young women. Moreover, significant positive correlations were observed between HPV6\/11\/16\/18-antibodies in first-void urine and paired sera. Further optimization and validation are required to demonstrate its potential use in epidemiological studies and follow-up of HPV vaccination.","1206":"Modelling the spatial spread of vector-borne zoonotic pathogens maintained in enzootic transmission cycles remains a major challenge. The best available spatio-temporal data on pathogen spread often take the form of human disease surveillance data. By applying a classic ecological approach-occupancy modelling-to an epidemiological question of disease spread, we used surveillance data to examine the latent ecological invasion of tick-borne pathogens. Over the last half-century, previously undescribed tick-borne pathogens including the agents of Lyme disease and human babesiosis have rapidly spread across the northeast United States. Despite their epidemiological importance, the mechanisms of tick-borne pathogen invasion and drivers underlying the distinct invasion trajectories of the co-vectored pathogens remain unresolved. Our approach allowed us to estimate the unobserved ecological processes underlying pathogen spread while accounting for imperfect detection of human cases. Our model predicts that tick-borne diseases spread in a diffusion-like manner with occasional long-distance dispersal and that babesiosis spread exhibits strong dependence on Lyme disease.","1207":"The results of this study will inform the design and feasibility of a definitive trial to address the use of local gentamicin in open tibial fractures. If proven effective, local gentamicin would be a low-cost strategy to reduce complications and disability from open tibial fractures that could impact care in both high- and low-income countries.ClinicalTrials.gov, Registration # NCT03559400 ; Registered June 18, 2018.Open tibia fractures are a major source of disability in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to the high incidence of complications, particularly infection and chronic osteomyelitis. One proposed adjunctive measure to reduce infection is prophylactic local antibiotic delivery, which can achieve much higher concentrations at the surgical site than can safely be achieved with systemic administration. Animal studies and retrospective clinical studies support the use of gentamicin for this purpose, but no high-quality clinical trials have been conducted to date in high- or low-income settings.We describe a protocol for a pilot study conducted in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to assess the feasibility of a single-center masked randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of locally applied gentamicin to placebo for the prevention of fracture-related infection in open tibial shaft fractures.","1208":"These findings reinforce the importance of ensuring adequate PPE supplies even in the absence of testing and provide support for strict subcohorting regimens to reduce outbreak potential in healthcare institutions.Since its onset, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, with particularly severe outcomes in healthcare institutions and congregate settings. To mitigate spread, healthcare systems have been cohorting patients to limit contacts between uninfected patients and potentially infected patients or healthcare workers (HCWs). A major challenge in managing the pandemic is the presence of currently asymptomatic\/presymptomatic individuals capable of transmitting the virus, who could introduce COVID-19 into uninfected cohorts. The optimal combination of personal protective equipment (PPE), testing and other approaches to prevent these events is unclear, especially in light of ongoing limited resources.Using stochastic simulations with a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered dynamic model, we quantified and compared the impacts of PPE use, patient and HCWs surveillance testing and subcohorting strategies.In the base case without testing or PPE, the healthcare system was rapidly overwhelmed, and became a net contributor to the force of infection. We found that effective use of PPE by both HCWs and patients could prevent this scenario, while random testing of apparently asymptomatic\/presymptomatic individuals on a weekly basis was less effective. We also found that even imperfect use of PPE could provide substantial protection by decreasing the force of infection. Importantly, we found that creating smaller patient\/HCW-interaction subcohorts can provide additional resilience to outbreak development with limited resources.","1209":"COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a sustained reduction in mortality at state level during the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron periods. The effect did not vary by naturally acquired immunity.COVID-19 mortality decreased as coverage of \u22651 dose increased among people \u226565 years of age, and this effect did not vary by seroprevalence or proportion of the total population ever infected. Seroprevalence and proportion ever infected were not associated with COVID-19 mortality, after controlling for vaccine coverage. These findings were consistent in all evaluation periods.Immune protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be induced by natural infection or vaccination or both. Interaction between vaccine-induced immunity and naturally acquired immunity at the population level has been understudied.We used regression models to evaluate whether the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines differed across states with different levels of naturally acquired immunity from March 2021 to April 2022 in the United States. Analysis was conducted for 3 evaluation periods separately (Alpha, Delta, and Omicron waves). As a proxy for the proportion of the population with naturally acquired immunity, we used either the reported seroprevalence or the estimated proportion of the population ever infected in each state.","1210":"Duration of mechanical ventilation is associated with adverse outcomes in critically ill patients and increased use of resources. The increasing complexity of medication regimens has been associated with increased mortality, length of stay, and fluid overload but has never been studied specifically in the setting of mechanical ventilation.The 318 patients [age 59.9 (SD 16.9), female 39.3%, medical 28.6%] had mean 24-hour MRC-ICU score of 21.3 (10.5), mean APACHE II score of 21.0 (5.4), mean SOFA score of 9.9 (3.3), and ICU mortality rate of 22.6% (n=72). The strongest performing logistic model was the base model with MRC-ICU added, with AUROC of 0.72, positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.83, and negative prediction value (NPV) of 0.92. The strongest overall model was Random Forest with an AUROC of 0.78, a PPV of 0.53, and NPV of 0.90. Feature importance analysis using support vector machine and Random Forest revealed severity of illness scores and medication related data were the most important predictors.The purpose of this analysis was to develop prediction models for mechanical ventilation duration to test the hypothesis that incorporating medication data may improve model performance.This was a retrospective cohort study of adults admitted to the ICU and undergoing mechanical ventilation for longer than 24 hours from October 2015 to October 2020. Patients were excluded if it was not their index ICU admission or if the patient was placed on comfort care in the first 24 hours of admission. Relevant patient characteristics including age, sex, body mass index, admission diagnosis, morbidities, vital signs measurements, severity of illness, medication regimen complexity as measured by the MRC-ICU, and medical treatments before intubation were collected. The primary outcome was area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of prediction models for prolonged mechanical ventilation (defined as greater than 5 days). Both logistic regression and supervised learning techniques including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine were used to develop prediction models.Medication regimen complexity is significantly associated with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients, and prediction models incorporating medication information showed modest improvement in this prediction.","1211":"Recent clinical trials of direct-acting-antiviral agents (DAAs) against hepatitis C virus (HCV) achieved >90% sustained virological response (SVR) rates, suggesting that cure often took place before the end of treatment (EOT). We sought to evaluate retrospectively whether early response kinetics can provide the basis to individualize therapy to achieve optimal results while reducing duration and cost.All but one patient who relapsed achieved SVR. Mean age was 60\u00b111years, 53% were male, 86% HCV genotype-1, 9% HIV coinfected, 43% advanced fibrosis (F3), and 57% had cirrhosis. At weeks 2, 4 and 6, 48%, 88% and 100% of patients had HCV<15IU\/ml, with 27%, 74% and 91% of observations having target not detected, respectively. Modeling results predicted that 23 (43%), 16 (30%), 7 (13%), 5 (9%) and 3 (5%) subjects were predicted to reach cure within 6, 8, 10, 12 and 13weeks of therapy, respectively. The modeling suggested that the patient who relapsed would have benefitted from an additional week of sofosbuvir+ledipasvir. Adjusting duration of treatment according to the modeling predicts reduced medication costs of 43-45% and 17-30% in subjects who had HCV<15IU\/ml at weeks 2 and 4, respectively.The use of early viral kinetic analysis has the potential to individualize duration of DAA therapy with a projected average cost saving of 16-20% per 100-treated persons.58 chronic HCV patients were treated with 12-week sofosbuvir+simeprevir (n=19), sofosbuvir+daclatasvir (n=19), or sofosbuvir+ledipasvir in three French referral centers. HCV was measured at baseline, day 2, every other week, EOT and 12weeks post EOT. Mathematical modeling was used to predict the time to cure, i.e., <1 virus copy in the entire extracellular body fluid.","1212":"In this work, we develop a formal method for deriving cell-based, spatial, multicellular models from ODE models of population dynamics in biological systems, and vice versa. We provide examples of generating spatiotemporal, multicellular models from ODE models of viral infection and immune response. In these models, the determinants of agreement of spatial and non-spatial models are the degree of spatial heterogeneity in viral production and rates of extracellular viral diffusion and decay. We show how ODE model parameters can implicitly represent spatial parameters, and cell-based spatial models can generate uncertain predictions through sensitivity to stochastic cellular events, which is not a feature of ODE models. Using our method, we can test ODE models in a multicellular, spatial context and translate information to and from non-spatial and spatial models, which help to employ spatiotemporal multicellular models using calibrated ODE model parameters. We additionally investigate objects and processes implicitly represented by ODE model terms and parameters and improve the reproducibility of spatial, stochastic models.The biophysics of an organism span multiple scales from subcellular to organismal and include processes characterized by spatial properties, such as the diffusion of molecules, cell migration, and flow of intravenous fluids. Mathematical biology seeks to explain biophysical processes in mathematical terms at, and across, all relevant spatial and temporal scales, through the generation of representative models. While non-spatial, ordinary differential equation (ODE) models are often used and readily calibrated to experimental data, they do not explicitly represent the spatial and stochastic features of a biological system, limiting their insights and applications. However, spatial models describing biological systems with spatial information are mathematically complex and computationally expensive, which limits the ability to calibrate and deploy them and highlights the need for simpler methods able to model the spatial features of biological systems.We developed and demonstrate a method for generating spatiotemporal, multicellular models from non-spatial population dynamics models of multicellular systems. We envision employing our method to generate new ODE model terms from spatiotemporal and multicellular models, recast popular ODE models on a cellular basis, and generate better models for critical applications where spatial and stochastic features affect outcomes.","1213":"The Sustainability and Industry Partnership Work Group (SIP-WG) is a part of the National Cancer Institute Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) program. The charter of the SIP-WG is to investigate options of long-term sustainability of open source software (OSS) developed by the ITCR, in part by developing a collection of business model archetypes that can serve as sustainability plans for ITCR OSS development initiatives. The workgroup assembled models from the ITCR program, from other studies, and via engagement of its extensive network of relationships with other organizations (e.g., Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Open Source Initiative and Software Sustainability Institute). This article reviews existing sustainability models and describes ten OSS use cases disseminated by the SIP-WG and others, and highlights five essential attributes (alignment with unmet scientific needs, dedicated development team, vibrant user community, feasible licensing model, and sustainable financial model) to assist academic software developers in achieving best practice in software sustainability.","1214":" = 0.006). In the validation cohort, the combination of HELQ and XAB2 (AUC = 0.863) showed the highest AUC. The expression levels of HELQ (RR 5.7, 95% CI 1.7-19.2) and XAB2 (RR 3.2, 95% CI 0.9-10.8) in ascites tumor cells were positively correlated to the risk of platinum resistance. In summary, we revealed that the expression levels of HELQ and XAB2 are candidate predictors for primary chemotherapy responsiveness and prognosis in HGSC. Ascites cytology is applicable as a promising method for chemosensitivity prediction in HGSC.","1215":"Insecticide resistance (IR) can undermine efforts to control vectors of public health importance. Aedes aegypti is the main vector of resurging diseases in the Americas such as yellow fever and dengue, and recently emerging chikungunya and Zika fever, which have caused unprecedented epidemics in the region. Vector control remains the primary intervention to prevent outbreaks of Aedes-transmitted diseases. In many high-risk regions, like southern Ecuador, we have limited information on IR. In this study, Ae. aegypti IR was measured across four cities in southern Ecuador using phenotypic assays and genetic screening for alleles associated with pyrethroid IR. Bottle bioassays showed significant inter-seasonal variation in resistance to deltamethrin, a pyrethroid commonly used by the Ministry of Health, and alpha-cypermethrin, as well as between-city differences in deltamethrin resistance. There was also a significant difference in phenotypic response to the organophosphate, Malathion, between two cities during the second sampling season. Frequencies of the resistant V1016I genotype ranged from 0.13 to 0.68. Frequencies of the resistant F1534C genotype ranged from 0.63 to 1.0, with sampled populations in Machala and Huaquillas at fixation for the resistant genotype in all sampled seasons. In Machala and Portovelo, there were statistically significant inter-seasonal variation in genotype frequencies for V1016I. Resistance levels were highest in Machala, a city with hyperendemic dengue transmission and historically intense insecticide use. Despite evidence that resistance alleles conferred phenotypic resistance to pyrethroids, there was not a precise correspondence between these indicators. For the F1534C gene, 17.6% of homozygous mutant mosquitoes and 70.8% of heterozygotes were susceptible, while for the V1016I gene, 45.6% homozygous mutants and 55.6% of heterozygotes were susceptible. This study shows spatiotemporal variability in IR in Ae. aegypti populations in southern coastal Ecuador, and provides an initial examination of IR in this region, helping to guide vector control efforts for Ae. aegypti.","1216":"Closely related populations often differ in resistance to a given parasite, as measured by infection success or failure. Yet, the immunological mechanisms of these evolved differences are rarely specified. Does resistance evolve via changes to the host\u0092s ability to recognize that an infection exists, actuate an effective immune response, or attenuate that response? We tested whether each of these phases of the host response contributed to threespine sticklebacks\u0092 recently evolved resistance to their tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus. While marine stickleback and some susceptible lake fish permit fast-growing tapeworms, other lake populations are resistant and suppress tapeworm growth via a fibrosis response. We subjected lab-raised fish from three populations (susceptible marine \u0091ancestors\u0092, a susceptible lake, a resistant lake), to a novel immune challenge (injection of: 1) a saline control, 2) alum, a generalized pro-inflammatory adjuvant that causes fibrosis, 3) a tapeworm protein extract, and 4) a combination of alum and tapeworm protein). All three populations were capable of a robust fibrosis response to the alum treatments (but not the saline control). Yet, only the resistant population exhibited a fibrosis response to the tapeworm protein alone. Thus, these populations differed in their ability to recognize the tapeworm but shared an intact fibrosis pathway. However, the resistant population also initiated fibrosis faster, and was able to attenuate fibrosis, unlike the susceptible populations slow but longer-lasting response to alum. As fibrosis has presumed pathological side-effects, this difference may reflect adaptions to mitigate costs of immunity in the resistant population. Broadly, our results confirm that parasite detection, activation speed, and immune attenuation simultaneously contribute to adaptations to parasite infection in natural populations.","1217":"In countries where soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are endemic, deworming programs are recommended to reduce morbidity; however, increasing levels of resistance to benzimidazoles are of concern. In an observational study in Peru, we studied the clinical efficacy of 400 mg of albendazole 20 days after treatment among children aged 2-11 years. Of 426 participants who provided samples, 52.3% were infected with a STH, 144 (33.8%) were positive for Ascaris (41.8% light, 50.8% moderate, and 7.4% heavy infections), 147 (34.5%) were positive for Trichuris (75.2% light, 22.5% moderate, and 2.3% heavy infections), and 1.1% were positive for hookworm species (100% light infections). Additional stool samples were examined at 20, 90, and 130 days after the initial treatment. At 20 days post-administration of albendazole, the cure rate (CR) of Ascaris infection was 80.1% (95% CI: 73.5-86.7), and the egg reduction rate (ERR) was 70.8% (95% CI: 57.8-88.7); the CR for Trichuris infection was 27.1% (95% CI: 20.0-34.3), and the ERR was 29.8% (95% CI: -1.40 to 57.5). Among participants with persistent or recurrent infections with Trichuris, the combined therapy of albendazole (400 mg) and ivermectin at 600 \u00b5g\/dose increased overall CR for Trichuris infection to 75.2% (95% CI: 67.3-83.2%) with an ERR of 84.2% (95% CI: 61.3-93.8%). Albendazole administration alone for the control of STH was associated with high rates of treatment failure, especially for Trichuris. Combined single doses of albendazole and ivermectin was observed to have improved efficacy.","1218":"Oxidative stress, characterized by an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's antioxidant defenses, significantly affects cellular function and viability. It plays a pivotal role in modulating membrane potentials, particularly action potentials (APs), essential for properly functioning excitable cells such as neurons, smooth muscles, pancreatic beta cells, and myocytes. The interaction between oxidative stress and AP dynamics is crucial for understanding the pathophysiology of various conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiac arrhythmias, and ischemia-reperfusion injuries. This review explores how oxidative stress influences APs, focusing on alterations in ion channel biophysics, gap junction, calcium dynamics, mitochondria, and Interstitial Cells of Cajal functions. By integrating current research, we aim to elucidate how oxidative stress contributes to disease progression and discuss potential therapeutic interventions targeting this interaction.","1219":"OBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nIn 2013 December, PAHO confirmed the local circulation of chikungunya virus (CHKV) in the region. In 2014 September Colombia reported the first local CHKV case in the Bol\u00edvar, and started an outbreak within a susceptible population. The objective of this analysis is to estimate the medical care cost of children patients with suspect of CHKV attended at a reference pediatric Hospital in Cartagena-Bolivar, at the start of the CHKV local transmission in Colombia.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nA retrospective bottom-up cost analysis was designed. We selected randomized sample of clinical records from children patients with CHKV clinically suspected during September \u0096 November 2014 at the Hospital \u0093Napole\u00f3n Franco Pareja\u0094 in Cartagena city, Colombia. A costing data collection instrument was designed a piloted to collect the information about the frequency of use activities and supplies by patient. Administrative and cost data by patient and activity were obtained from the Hospital. Costing items included: consults, hospitalization bed-day, supplies, drugs, and diagnosis and therapeutic procedures. Total cost per cost item and patient were estimated and average cost per patient reported. Costs were expressed in 2014 USD with an Exchange rate of 2392.46 COP per American dollar.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nA sample of 67 clinical records were analyzed. The average cost per CHKV children patient was US$517.5 (US$756.9 in equal or older than 1 year old, and US$375.1 in under one year population). The average length of stay was 2,7 days per patient. More prescript drugs were oral rehydration salts and acetaminophen. The more requested labs were hematic chart (13.8%) and protein C reactive (7.57%).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nDespite CHKV infection is not a lethal disease, it would cause a very huge impact in the health services and it associated cost in Colombia. Cost per case in children is high, and probably would be similar or higher in adult population.","1220":"Medically important flaviviruses cause diverse disease pathologies and collectively are responsible for a major global disease burden. A contributing factor to pathogenesis is secreted flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1). Despite demonstrated protection by NS1-specific antibodies against lethal flavivirus challenge, the structural and mechanistic basis remains unknown. Here, we present three crystal structures of full-length dengue virus NS1 complexed with a flavivirus-cross-reactive, NS1-specific monoclonal antibody, 2B7, at resolutions between 2.89 and 3.96 angstroms. These structures reveal a protective mechanism by which two domains of NS1 are antagonized simultaneously. The NS1 wing domain mediates cell binding, whereas the \u03b2-ladder triggers downstream events, both of which are required for dengue, Zika, and West Nile virus NS1-mediated endothelial dysfunction. These observations provide a mechanistic explanation for 2B7 protection against NS1-induced pathology and demonstrate the potential of one antibody to treat infections by multiple flaviviruses.","1221":"Background Argentina is located at the southern temperate range of arboviral transmission by the mosquito Aedes aegypti and has experienced a rapid increase in disease transmission in recent years. Here we present findings from an entomological surveillance study that began in C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina, following the emergence of dengue in 2009.\r\n\r\nMethods From 2009 to 2017, larval surveys were conducted monthly, from November to May, in 600 randomly selected households distributed across the city. From 2009 to 2013, ovitraps (n=177) were sampled weekly to monitor the oviposition activity of Ae. aegypti. We explored seasonal and interannual dynamics of entomological variables and dengue transmission. Cross correlation analysis was used to identify significant lag periods.\r\n\r\nResults Aedes aegypti were detected over the entire study period, and abundance peaked during the summer months (January to March). We identified a considerable increase in the proportion of homes with juvenile Ae. aegypti over the study period (from 5.7% of homes in 2009-10 to 15.4% of homes in 2016-17). Aedes aegypti eggs per ovitrap and larval abundance were positively associated with temperature in the same month. Autochthonous dengue transmission peaked in April, following a peak in imported dengue cases in March; autochthonous dengue was not positively associated with vector or climate variables.\r\n\r\nConclusions This longitudinal study provides insights into the complex dynamics of arbovirus transmission and vector populations in a temperate region of arbovirus emergence. Our findings suggest that C\u00f3rdoba is well suited for arbovirus disease transmission, given the stable and abundant vector populations. Further studies are needed to better understand the role of regional human movement.","1222":"Recent studies have shown that systems combining mathematical modeling and Bayesian inference methods can be used to generate real-time forecasts of future infectious disease incidence. Here we develop such a system to study and forecast respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV is the most common cause of acute lower respiratory infection and bronchiolitis. Advanced warning of the epidemic timing and volume of RSV patient surges has the potential to reduce well-documented delays of treatment in emergency departments. We use a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model in conjunction with an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) and ten years of regional U.S. specimen data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The data and EAKF are used to optimize the SIR model and i) estimate critical epidemiological parameters over the course of each outbreak and ii) generate retrospective forecasts. The basic reproductive number, R0, is estimated at 3.0 (standard deviation 0.6) across all seasons and locations. The peak magnitude of RSV outbreaks is forecast with nearly 70% accuracy (i.e. nearly 70% of forecasts within 25% of the actual peak), four weeks before the predicted peak. This work represents a first step in the development of a real-time RSV prediction system.","1223":"Subtype B HIV-1 has been the primary driver of the HIV-1 epidemic in the United States (U.S.) for over forty years and is also a prominent subtype in the Americas, Europe, Australia, the Middle East and North Africa. In this study, the neutralization profiles of contemporary subtype B Envs from the U.S. were assessed to characterize changes in neutralization sensitivities over time. We generated a panel of 30 contemporary pseudoviruses (PSVs) and demonstrated continued diversification of subtype B Env from the 1980s up to 2018. Neutralization sensitivities of the contemporary subtype B PSVs were characterized using 31 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and were compared with strains from earlier in the HIV-1 pandemic. A significant reduction in Env neutralization sensitivity was observed for 27 out of 31 NAbs for the contemporary as compared to earlier-decade subtype B PSVs. A decline in neutralization sensitivity was observed across all Env domains; the NAbs that were most potent early in the pandemic suffered the greatest decline in potency over time. A meta-analysis demonstrated this trend across multiple subtypes. As HIV-1 Env diversification continues, changes in Env antigenicity and neutralization sensitivity should continue to be evaluated to inform the development of improved vaccine and antibody products to prevent and treat HIV-1.","1224":"Polypropylene fibers present favorable physical, hydraulic and specific surface area properties for use as a raw material or substrate in developing a novel iron-oxide-coated medium for the adsorption of heavy metals from drinking water. However, polypropylene fibers have not been explored for their ability to retain iron oxide coating under realistic flow rates for water treatment. This study evaluated the ability of polypropylene to retain its coating under flow rates used in water treatment, through column studies. A full factorial experimental design was used to evaluate the effects of flow rate, packing scheme (in-plane or cross-plane) and location within the column on iron retention. The polypropylene mat achieved an iron density of 86 mg Fe\/g medium of material and retained 73% of this coating after being subjected to hydraulic flows in the cross-plane direction several times those used in water treatment. This is substantially higher than the amount of iron retained on sand as reported by previous researchers. Further investigation should evaluate pre-treatment methods which may facilitate strong chemical bonds between the iron and fiber to create a more consistent coating.","1225":"We report temporal patterns of viral shedding in 94 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and modeled COVID-19 infectiousness profiles from a separate sample of 77 infector-infectee transmission pairs. We observed the highest viral load in throat swabs at the time of symptom onset, and inferred that infectiousness peaked on or before symptom onset. We estimated that 44% (95% confidence interval, 25-69%) of secondary cases were infected during the index cases' presymptomatic stage, in settings with substantial household clustering, active case finding and quarantine outside the home. Disease control measures should be adjusted to account for probable substantial presymptomatic transmission.","1226":"We analyzed publicly available data from the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and fit linear mixed-effects regression models to leprosy case detection trends reported at the district level. We assessed correlation of the new district-level case detection rate for leprosy with several state-level regressors: TB incidence, BCG coverage, fraction of cases exhibiting grade 2 disability at diagnosis, fraction of cases in children, and fraction multibacillary.Our analyses suggest an endemic disease in very slow decline, with substantial spatial heterogeneity at both district and state levels. Enhanced active case finding was associated with a higher case detection rate.Leprosy is caused by infection with Mycobacterium leprae and is characterized by peripheral nerve damage and skin lesions. The disease is classified into paucibacillary (PB) and multibacillary (MB) leprosy. The 2012 London Declaration formulated the following targets for leprosy control: (1) global interruption of transmission or elimination by 2020, and (2) reduction of grade-2 disabilities in newly detected cases to below 1 per million population at a global level by 2020. Leprosy is treatable, but diagnosis, access to treatment and treatment adherence (all necessary to curtail transmission) represent major challenges. Globally, new case detection rates for leprosy have remained fairly stable in the past decade, with India responsible for more than half of cases reported annually.Trend analysis of reported new detection rates from India does not support a thesis of rapid progress in leprosy control.","1227":"Neonates are highly susceptible to bacterial meningitis as compared to children and adults. Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a major cause of neonatal meningitis. Neonatal meningitis can result from GBS intestinal colonization and translocation across the intestinal barrier (IB). Here, we show that the immaturity of the neonatal intestinal microbiota leads to low resistance to GBS intestinal colonization and permissiveness of the gut-vascular barrier. Moreover, the age-dependent but microbiota-independent Wnt activity in intestinal and choroid plexus (CP) epithelia results in a lower degree of cell-cell junctions' polarization, which favors bacterial translocation. This study thus reveals that neonatal susceptibility to GBS meningitis results from the age-dependent immaturity of the intestinal microbiota and developmental pathways associated with neonatal tissue growth, which both concur to GBS gut colonization, systemic dissemination, and neuroinvasion. Whereas the activation of developmental pathways is intrinsic to neonates, interventions aimed at maturing the microbiota may help prevent neonatal meningitis.","1228":"Data regarding mice exposed to Eastern, Venezuelan and Western equine encephalitis viruses (EEV, VEV and WEV respectively) were used to optimize two physiologically plausible dose response models. A rich data set was extracted from an intensive literature review, with 42 independent dose groups over three exposure routes: subcutaneous, intracranial and intraperitoneal. The data demonstrate the highly infectious nature of these encephalitis viruses to a general population. However, from an examination of the data, a dependency in the dose response relationship with respect to host age is likely. This host age dependency is manifesting as an increased resistance with increased host age, conversely, higher susceptibility at lower host ages. Considering the inability to pool host age groups under a nested model, this likely host age dependency is highlighted to a greater extent. Most of the host age groups (65%) could not be used for dose-response model optimization, leaving 13 host age groups of the original 37 that could be used for optimization. Those that could be used resulted in the exponential model being the better fitting model for 61% of those data, with the approximated form of the beta Poisson being the better fitting model for the remaining five data sets.","1229":"Background: Population-level estimates of prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity (seroprevalence) is a crucial epidemiological indicator for tracking the Covid-19 epidemic. Such data are in short supply, both internationally and in South Africa. The South African blood services (the South African National Blood Service, SANBS and the Western Cape Blood Service, WCBS) are coordinating a nationally representative survey of blood donors, which it is hoped can become a cost-effective surveillance method with validity for community-level seroprevalence estimation. Methods: Leveraging existing arrangements, SANBS human research ethics committee permission was obtained to test blood donations collected on predefined days (7th, 10th ,12th ,15th ,20th ,23th and 25th January) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, using the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay on the cobas e411 platform currently available in the blood services' donation testing laboratories. Using standard methods, prevalence analysis was done by province, age and race, allowing age to be regarded as either a continuous or categorical variable. Testing was performed in the Eastern Cape (EC), Free State (FS), KwaZulu Natal (ZN) and Northern Cape (NC) provinces. Results: We report on data from 4858 donors - 1457 in EC; 463 in NC; 831 in FS and 2107 in ZN. Prevalence varied substantially across race groups and between provinces, with seroprevalence among Black donors consistently several times higher than among White donors, and the other main population groups (Coloured and Asian) not consistently represented in all provinces. There is no clear evidence that seroprevalence among donors varies by age. Weighted net estimates of prevalence (in the core age range 15-69) by province (compared with official clinically-confirmed COVID-19 case rates in mid-January 2021) are: EC-63%(2.8%), NC-32%(2.2%), FS-46%(2.4%), and ZN-52%(2.4%). Conclusions: Our study demonstrates substantial differences in dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 infection between different race groups, most likely explained by historically based differences in socio-economic status and housing conditions. As has been seen in other areas, even such high seroprevalence does not guarantee population-level immunity against new outbreaks - probably due to viral evolution and waning of antibody neutralization. Despite its limitations, notably a 'healthy donor' effect, it seems plausible that these estimates are reasonably generalisable to actual population level anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, but should be further verified.","1230":" T\u00a0cells may play an important role in antibody maintenance following COVID-19.","1231":"The EMOD model of malaria transmission was calibrated to prevalence, incidence, asexual parasite density, gametocyte density, infection duration, and infectiousness data from nine study sites. The infectious reservoir was characterized by age and parasite detectability with diagnostics of varying sensitivity over a range of transmission intensities with and without case management and vector control. Mass screen-and-treat drug campaigns were tested for likelihood of achieving elimination.The composition of the infectious reservoir is similar over a range of transmission intensities, and higher intensity settings are biased towards infections in children. Recent ramp-ups in case management and use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) reduce the infectious reservoir and shift the composition towards sub-microscopic infections. Mass campaigns with anti-malarial drugs are highly effective at interrupting transmission if deployed shortly after ITN campaigns.Elimination of malaria can only be achieved through removal of all vectors or complete depletion of the infectious reservoir in humans. Mechanistic models can be built to synthesize diverse observations from the field collected under a variety of conditions and subsequently used to query the infectious reservoir in great detail.Low-density infections comprise a substantial portion of the infectious reservoir. Proper timing of vector control, seasonal variation in transmission intensity and mass drug campaigns allows lingering population immunity to help drive a region towards elimination.","1232":"The effectiveness of inactivated vaccines (VE) against symptomatic and severe COVID-19 caused by omicron is unknown. We conducted a nationwide, test-negative, case-control study to estimate VE for homologous and heterologous (BNT162b2) booster doses in adults who received two doses of CoronaVac in Brazil in the Omicron context. Analyzing 1,386,544 matched-pairs, VE against symptomatic disease was 8.6% (95%\u2009CI, 5.6-11.5) and 56.8% (95%\u2009CI, 56.3-57.3) in the period 8-59 days after receiving a homologous and heterologous booster, respectively. During the same interval, VE against severe Covid-19 was 73.6% (95%\u2009CI, 63.9-80.7) and 86.0% (95%\u2009CI, 84.5-87.4) after receiving a homologous and heterologous booster, respectively. Waning against severe Covid-19 after 120 days was only observed after a homologous booster. Heterologous booster might be preferable to individuals with completed primary series inactivated vaccine.","1233":"Prior to vaccine introduction in 2006, rotavirus was the leading cause of severe diarrhea in children under five years of age in the U.S. Vaccination of infants has led to major reductions in disease burden, a shift in the seasonal peak and the emergence of a biennial pattern of disease. However, rotavirus vaccine coverage has remained relatively low (70-75%) compared to other infant immunizations in the U.S. Part of the reason for this lower coverage is that children whose care is provided by family practitioners (FP) have considerably lower probability of being vaccinated compared to those seen be pediatricians (PE). We used a dynamic transmission model to assess the impact of improving rotavirus vaccine coverage by FP and\/or PE on rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) incidence and seasonal patterns.A deterministic age-structured dynamic model with susceptible, infectious, and recovered compartments (SIRS model) was used to simulate rotavirus transmission and vaccination. We estimated the reduction of RVGE cases by 2 doses of rotavirus vaccine with three vaccination scenarios: (Status Quo: 85% coverage by pediatricians and 45% coverage by family practitioners; Improved FP: 85% coverage by pediatricians and family practitioners; Improved FP+PE: 95% coverage by pediatricians and family practitioners). In addition, we tested the sensitivity of the model to the assumption of random mixing patterns between children visiting pediatricians and children visiting family practitioners.In this model, higher vaccine coverage provided by family practitioners and pediatricians leads to lower incidence of severe RVGE cases (23% averted in Improved FP and 57% averted in Improved FP+PE compared to Status Quo) including indirect effects. One critical impact of higher total vaccine coverage is the effect on rotavirus epidemic patterns in the U.S.; the biennial rotavirus epidemic patterns shifted to reduced annual epidemic patterns. Additionally, assortative mixing patterns in children visiting pediatricians and family practitioners amplify the impact of increasing vaccine coverage.Other high-income countries that introduced vaccine have not experienced biennial patterns, like the U.S. Our results suggest that increasing overall vaccine coverage to 85% among infants would lead to an overall reduction in incidence with annual epidemic patterns.","1234":"Symptomatic outpatients aged \u226512\u2009years reporting acute onset of COVID-19-like illness and tested for SARS-CoV-2 between February 1 and September 30, 2021 were enrolled. Participants were stratified by self-report of having known contact with a COVID-19 case in the 14\u2009days prior to illness onset. Vaccine effectiveness was evaluated using the test-negative study design and multivariable logistic regression.Among 2229 participants, 283\/451 (63%) of those reporting contact and 331\/1778 (19%) without known contact tested SARS-CoV-2-positive. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 71% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49%-83%) among fully vaccinated participants reporting a known contact versus 80% (95% CI, 72%-86%) among those with no known contact (p-value for interaction\u2009=\u20090.2).This study contributes to growing evidence of the benefits of vaccinations in preventing COVID-19 and support vaccination recommendations and the importance of efforts to increase vaccination coverage.Individuals in contact with persons with COVID-19 are at high risk of developing COVID-19; protection offered by COVID-19 vaccines in the context of known exposure is poorly understood.","1235":"Our work suggests that testing, tracing and masks can all be effective means of controlling transmission. A multifaceted strategy that combines all three, alongside continued hygiene and distancing protocols, is likely to be the most robust means of controlling transmission of SARS-CoV-2.We find that the relative impact of masks is greatest when testing and tracing rates are lower and vice versa. Scenarios with very high testing rates (90% of people with symptoms, plus 90% of people with a known history of contact with a confirmed case) were estimated to lead to a robustly controlled epidemic. However, across comparable levels of mask uptake and contact tracing, the number of infections over this period was projected to be 2-3 times higher if the testing rate was 80% instead of 90%, 8-12 times higher if the testing rate was 65% or 30-50 times higher with a 50% testing rate. In reality, NSW diagnosed 254 locally acquired cases over this period, an outcome that had a moderate probability in the model (10%-18%) assuming low mask uptake (0%-25%), even in the presence of extremely high testing (90%) and near-perfect community contact tracing (75%-100%), and a considerably higher probability if testing or tracing were at lower levels.None (simulation study).The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic illustrated that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, has the potential to spread exponentially. Therefore, as long as a substantial proportion of the population remains susceptible to infection, the potential for new epidemic waves persists even in settings with low numbers of active COVID-19 infections, unless sufficient countermeasures are in place. We aim to quantify vulnerability to resurgences in COVID-19 transmission under variations in the levels of testing, tracing and mask usage.The Australian state of New South Wales (NSW), a setting with prolonged low transmission, high mobility, non-universal mask usage and a well-functioning test-and-trace system.","1236":"Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease, targeted by the World Health Organization for reduction in morbidity by 2020. It is caused by parasitic flukes that spread through contamination of local water sources. Traditional control focuses on mass drug administration, which kills the majority of adult worms, targeted at school-aged children. However, these drugs do not confer long-term protection and there are concerns over the emergence of drug resistance. The development of a vaccine against schistosomiasis opens the potential for control methods that could generate long-lasting population-level immunity if they are cost-effective.We found that sufficiently low-priced vaccines can be more cost-effective than traditional drugs in high prevalence settings, and can lead to a greater reduction in morbidity over shorter time-scales. MDA or vaccination programmes that target the whole community generate the most health benefits, but are generally less cost-effective than those targeting children, due to lower prevalence of schistosomiasis in adults.The ultimate cost-effectiveness of vaccination will be highly dependent on multiple vaccine characteristics, such as the efficacy, cost, safety and duration of protection, as well as the subset of population targeted for vaccination. However, our results indicate that if a vaccine could be developed with reasonable characteristics and for a sufficiently low cost, then vaccination programmes can be a highly cost-effective method of controlling schistosomiasis in high-transmission areas. The population-level immunity generated by vaccination will also inevitably improve the chances of interrupting transmission of the disease, which is the long-term epidemiological goal.Using an individual-based transmission model, matched to epidemiological data, we compared the cost-effectiveness of a range of vaccination programmes against mass drug administration, across three transmission settings. Health benefit was measured by calculating the heavy-intensity infection years averted by each intervention, while vaccine costs were assessed against robust estimates for the costs of mass drug administration obtained from data. We also calculated a critical vaccination cost, a cost beyond which vaccination might not be economically favorable, by benchmarking the cost-effectiveness of potential vaccines against the cost-effectiveness of mass drug administration, and examined the effect of different vaccine protection durations.","1237":"Small populations (e.g., hospitals, schools or workplaces) are characterised by high contact heterogeneity and stochasticity affecting pathogen transmission dynamics. Empirical individual contact data provide unprecedented information to characterize such heterogeneity and are increasingly available, but are usually collected over a limited period, and can suffer from observation bias. We propose an algorithm to stochastically reconstruct realistic temporal networks from individual contact data in healthcare settings (HCS) and test this approach using real data previously collected in a long-term care facility (LTCF). Our algorithm generates full networks from recorded close-proximity interactions, using hourly inter-individual contact rates and information on individuals' wards, the categories of staff involved in contacts, and the frequency of recurring contacts. It also provides data augmentation by reconstructing contacts for days when some individuals are present in the HCS without having contacts recorded in the empirical data. Recording bias is formalized through an observation model, to allow direct comparison between the augmented and observed networks. We validate our algorithm using data collected during the i-Bird study, and compare the empirical and reconstructed networks. The algorithm was substantially more accurate to reproduce network characteristics than random graphs. The reconstructed networks reproduced well the assortativity by ward (first-third quartiles observed: 0.54-0.64; synthetic: 0.52-0.64) and the hourly staff and patient contact patterns. Importantly, the observed temporal correlation was also well reproduced (0.39-0.50 vs 0.37-0.44), indicating that our algorithm could recreate a realistic temporal structure. The algorithm consistently recreated unobserved contacts to generate full reconstructed networks for the LTCF. To conclude, we propose an approach to generate realistic temporal contact networks and reconstruct unobserved contacts from summary statistics computed using individual-level interaction networks. This could be applied and extended to generate contact networks to other HCS using limited empirical data, to subsequently inform individual-based epidemic models.","1238":"In December 2022-January 2023, we estimated excess death rates of 0.94 per 100 persons (95% confidence interval: -0.54, 3.16) in CAE members aged 80-84 years, 3.95 (95% CI: 0.50, 7.84) in 85-89 years, 10.35 (95% CI: 3.59, 17.71) in 90-94 years and 16.88 (95% CI: 0.00, 34.62) in 95 years and older. Using our baseline assumptions, this extrapolated to 917,000 (95% CI: 425,000-1.45 million) excess deaths among urban-dwellers in Mainland China, much higher than the 81,000 in-hospital deaths officially reported from December 9, 2022 to January 30, 2023.As in many jurisdictions, we estimate that the COVID-19 pandemic had a much wider impact on mortality than what was officially documented in Mainland China.Using obituary data from the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), we estimated the excess death rate among senior CAE members by taking the difference between the observed rate of all-cause death in December 2022-January 2023 and the expected rate for the same months in 2017 to 2022 by age groups. We used this to extrapolate an estimate of the number of excess deaths in December 2022-January 2023 among urban dwellers in Mainland China.Mainland China experienced a major surge in SARS-CoV-2 infections in December 2022-January 2023, but its impact on mortality was unclear given the under-reporting of COVID-19 deaths.","1239":". At the pace at which descriptions of new species are currently being published, the description of all bacterial species on earth will only be completed in thousands of years. However, even if one day all species were named and described, these names and descriptions would still be of little practical value unless they could be easily searched and accessed, so that novel strains could be easily identified as members of any of these species. To complicate the situation further, many of the currently known species contain significant genotypic and phenotypic diversity that would still be missed if description of microbial diversity were limited to species. The solution to this problem could be a database in which every bacterial species and every intra-specific group is anchored to a genome-similarity framework. This ideal database should be searchable using complete or partial genome sequences as well as phenotypes. Moreover, the database should include functions to easily add newly sequenced novel strains, automatically place them into the genome-similarity framework, identify them as members of an already named species, or tag them as members of yet to be described species or new intra-specific groups. Here, we propose the means to develop such a database by taking advantage of the concept of genome sequence similarity-based codes, called Life Identification Numbers or LINs.","1240":"To evaluate the effectiveness of an annual SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign, quantify the health and economic benefits of a second dose provided to children younger than 2 years and adults aged 50 years or older, and optimize the timing of a second dose.The optimal timing between the first and second dose delivered to children younger than 2 years and adults aged 50 years or older in an annual vaccination campaign was estimated to be 5 months. In direct comparison with a single-dose campaign, a second booster dose results in 123\u2009869 fewer hospitalizations (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 121\u2009994 to 125\u2009742 fewer hospitalizations) and 5524 fewer deaths (95% UI, 5434 to 5613 fewer deaths), averting $3.63 billion (95% UI, $3.57 billion to $3.69 billion) in costs over a single year.The direct health care costs of SARS-CoV-2, particularly among adults aged 50 years or older, would be substantially reduced by administering a second dose 5 months after the initial dose.A synthetic population reflecting demographics and contact patterns in the United States.United States.Population immunity is subject to degrees of immune evasion for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

These patterns were correlated with shared polysaccharide components. This might reflect adaptation of strains to produce capsules with specific characteristics.We used the PubMLST and Global Pneumococcal Sequencing (GPS) databases to quantify the number of genetic lineages on which different serotype pairs co-occur. We also quantified the genetic diversity of each serotype. Regression models evaluated the relationship between shared polysaccharide components and the frequency of serotype co-occurrence and diversity.Pneumococcus is a diverse pathogen, with >90 serotypes, each of which has a distinct polysaccharide capsule. Pneumococci can switch capsules, evading vaccine pressure. Certain serotype pairs are more likely to occur on the same genetic background as a results of serotype switching, but the drivers of these patterns are not well understood.A number of serotype pairs co-occurred on the same genetic lineage more commonly than expected. Co-occurrence of between-serogroup pairs was more common when both serotypes had glucose as a component of the capsule (and, potentially, glucuronic acid, any-N-acetylated sugar or ribitol). Diversity also varied markedly by serotype and was associated with the presence of specific sugars in the capsule.","1242":"Current-month HIV is associated with increasing HCV cases, abscess incision and drainage, and SSTI cases, in distinct temporal patterns. For example, 1 additional HCV case occurring 5 and 7 months previously is associated with a 4% increase in the odds of observing at least 1 current-month HIV case in a given locale (odds ratios, 1.04 [90% credible interval {CrI}: 1.01-1.10] and 1.04 [90% CrI: 1.00-1.09]). No such associations were observed for echocardiograms, IE, or overdose.We analyzed the temporal patterns of infectious disease and overdose using a hierarchical Bayesian distributed lag logistic regression model examining the probability that a given geographic area experienced at least 1 HIV case in a given month as a function of the counts\/rates of overdose, HCV, SSTI, and IE and associated medical procedures at different lagged time periods.Since 2014, multiple outbreaks of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among people who inject drugs have occurred across the United States along with hepatitis C virus (HCV), skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), and infective endocarditis (IE), creating a converging public health crisis.Lagged associations in other infections preceding rises in current-month HIV counts cannot be described as predictive of HIV outbreaks but may point toward newly discovered epidemics of injection drug use and associated clinical sequalae, prompting clinicians to screen patients more carefully for substance use disorder and associated infections.","1243":"Sleep in the primate order remains understudied, with quantitative estimates of sleep duration available for less than 10% of primate species. Even fewer species have had their sleep synchronously quantified with meteorological data, which have been shown to influence sleep-wake regulatory behaviors. We report the first sleep duration estimates in two captive gibbon species, the Javan gibbon (Hylobates moloch) and the pileated gibbon (Hylobates pileatus) (N\u2009=\u200952 nights). We also investigated how wind speed, humidity, temperature, lunar phase, and illumination from moonlight influence sleep-wake regulation, including sleep duration, sleep fragmentation, and sleep efficiency. Gibbons exhibited strict diurnal behavior with little nighttime activity and mean total average sleep duration of 11\u00a0h and 53\u00a0min for Hylobates moloch and 12\u00a0h and 29\u00a0min for Hylobates pileatus. Gibbons had notably high sleep efficiency (i.e., time score asleep divided by the time they spent in their sleeping site, mean of 98.3%). We found illumination from moonlight in relation to lunar phase and amount of wind speed to be the strongest predictors of sleep duration and high-quality sleep, with increased moonlight and increased wind causing more fragmentation and less sleep efficiency. We conclude that arousal threshold is sensitive to nighttime illumination and wind speed. Sensitivity to wind speed may reflect adaptations to counter the risk of falling during arboreal sleep.","1244":"Social networks are increasingly recognized as important points of intervention, yet relatively few intervention studies of respiratory infection transmission have utilized a network design. Here we describe the design, methods, and social network structure of a randomized intervention for isolating respiratory infection cases in a university setting over a 10-week period.590 students in six residence halls enrolled in the eX-FLU study during a chain-referral recruitment process from September 2012-January 2013. Of these, 262 joined as \"seed\" participants, who nominated their social contacts to join the study, of which 328 \"nominees\" enrolled. Participants were cluster-randomized by 117 residence halls. Participants were asked to respond to weekly surveys on health behaviors, social interactions, and influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms. Participants were randomized to either a 3-Day dorm room isolation intervention or a control group (no isolation) upon illness onset. ILI cases reported on their isolation behavior during illness and provided throat and nasal swab specimens at onset, day-three, and day-six of illness. A subsample of individuals (N=103) participated in a sub-study using a novel smartphone application, iEpi, which collected sensor and contextually-dependent survey data on social interactions. Within the social network, participants were significantly positively assortative by intervention group, enrollment type, residence hall, iEpi participation, age, gender, race, and alcohol use (all P<0.002).We identified a feasible study design for testing the impact of isolation from social networks in a university setting. These data provide an unparalleled opportunity to address questions about isolation and infection transmission, as well as insights into social networks and behaviors among college-aged students. Several important lessons were learned over the course of this project, including feasible isolation durations, the need for extensive organizational efforts, as well as the need for specialized programmers and server space for managing survey and smartphone data.","1245":"Poor pregnancy outcomes include miscarriages, stillbirths, and low birth weights. Stress from heat and lack of resources play a potentially important role in producing these poor outcomes. Women and couples who experience these poor outcomes rather than a healthy birth suffer psychological, physical, social, and financial costs as well. We use detailed reproductive data in combination with fine-scale climate data to examine pregnancy outcomes among women in sub-Saharan Africa, a region that shelters some of the poorest families in the world. Fine-scale precipitation and temperature data allow each pregnancy to be matched to the relevant climate exposures. We investigate the linkages between climate and pregnancy outcomes using linear probability models with fixed effects to minimize confounding due to factors that vary by location, season, and year. We analyze retrospective pregnancy data from more than 65,000 pregnancies recorded in 23 surveys across 15 African countries. Our results indicate that pregnancy outcomes are indeed impacted by exposure to hot days even after considering other individual-level characteristics. This research provides insight into the linkages between climate and a major adverse health outcome faced by women. In doing so, this research expands scientific understanding of the impact of environmental factors on fertility outcomes.","1246":"To this end, we developed a mobile app that provides vector infestation risk maps generated with data from the control campaign run in a predictive model. The app is intended to enhance vector surveillance activities by giving inspectors the opportunity to incorporate the infestation risk information into their surveillance activities, but it does not dictate which houses to surveil. Therefore, a critical question becomes, will inspectors use the risk information? To answer this question, we ran a pilot study in which we compared surveillance using the app to the current practice (paper maps). We hypothesized that inspectors would use the risk information provided by the app, as measured by the frequency of higher risk houses visited, and qualitative analyses of inspector movement patterns in the field. We also compared the efficiency of both mediums to identify factors that might discourage risk information use. Over the course of ten days (five with each medium), 1,081 houses were visited using the paper maps, of which 366 (34%) were inspected, while 1,038 houses were visited using the app, with 401 (39%) inspected. Five out of eight inspectors (62.5%) visited more higher risk houses when using the app (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.001). Among all inspectors, there was an upward shift in proportional visits to higher risk houses when using the app (Mantel-Haenszel test, common odds ratio (OR) = 2.42, 95% CI 2.00-2.92), and in a second analysis using generalized linear mixed models, app use increased the odds of visiting a higher risk house 2.73-fold (95% CI 2.24-3.32), suggesting that the risk information provided by the app was used by most inspectors. Qualitative analyses of inspector movement revealed indications of risk information use in seven out of eight (87.5%) inspectors. There was no difference between the app and paper maps in the number of houses visited (paired t-test, p = 0.67) or inspected (p = 0.17), suggesting that app use did not reduce surveillance efficiency.Until recently, the Chagas disease vector, Triatoma infestans, was widespread in Arequipa, Per\u00fa, but as a result of a decades-long campaign in which over 70,000 houses were treated with insecticides, infestation prevalence is now greatly reduced. To monitor for T. infestans resurgence, the city is currently in a surveillance phase in which a sample of houses is selected for inspection each year. Despite extensive data from the control campaign that could be used to inform surveillance, the selection of houses to inspect is often carried out haphazardly or by convenience. Therefore, we asked, how can we enhance efforts toward preventing T. infestans resurgence by creating the opportunity for vector surveillance to be informed by data?Without staying vigilant to remaining and re-emerging vector foci following a vector control campaign, disease transmission eventually returns and progress achieved is reversed. Our results suggest that, when provided the opportunity, most inspectors will use risk information to direct their surveillance activities, at least over the short term. The study is an initial, but key, step toward evidence-based vector surveillance.","1247":"The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked an urgent need to uncover the underlying biology of this devastating disease. Though RNA viruses mutate more rapidly than DNA viruses, there are a relatively small number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that differentiate the main SARS-CoV-2 lineages that have spread throughout the world. In this study, we investigated 129 RNA-seq datasets and 6,928 consensus genomes to contrast the intrahost and interhost diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses yielded three major observations. First, the mutational profile of SARS-CoV-2 highlights iSNV and SNP similarity, albeit with differences in C>U changes. Second, iSNV and SNP patterns in SARS-CoV-2 are more similar to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV-1. Third, a significant fraction of insertions and deletions contribute to the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Altogether, our findings provide insight into SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity, inform the design of detection tests, and highlight the potential of iSNVs for tracking the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","1248":"Many complex systems can be represented as networks consisting of distinct types of interactions, which can be categorized as links belonging to different layers. For example, a good description of the full protein\u0096protein interactome requires, for some organisms, up to seven distinct network layers, accounting for different genetic and physical interactions, each containing thousands of protein\u0096protein relationships. A fundamental open question is then how many layers are indeed necessary to accurately represent the structure of a multilayered complex system. Here we introduce a method based on quantum theory to reduce the number of layers to a minimum while maximizing the distinguishability between the multilayer network and the corresponding aggregated graph. We validate our approach on synthetic benchmarks and we show that the number of informative layers in some real multilayer networks of protein\u0096genetic interactions, social, economical and transportation systems can be reduced by up to 75%.","1249":"In meta-population models for infectious diseases, the basic reproduction number R0 can be as much as 70% larger in the case of preferential mixing than that in homogeneous mixing\u00a0[J.W. Glasser, Z. Feng, S.B. Omer, P.J. Smith, and L.E.

This suggests that realistic mixing can be an important factor to consider in order for the models to provide a reliable assessment of intervention strategies. The influence of mixing is more significant when the population is highly heterogeneous. In this paper, another quantity, the final epidemic size ( F ) of an outbreak, is considered to examine the influence of mixing and population heterogeneity. Final size relation is derived for a meta-population model accounting for a general mixing. The results show that F can be influenced by the pattern of mixing in a significant way. Another interesting finding is that, heterogeneity in various sub-population characteristics may have the opposite effect on R0 and F .","1250":"Continuing the discussion of how children can modify and regularize linguistic inputs from adults, we present a new interpretation of existing algorithms to model and investigate the process of a learner learning from an inconsistent source. On the basis of this approach is a (possibly nonlinear) function (the update function) that relates the current state of the learner with an increment that it receives upon processing the source's input, in a sequence of updates. The model can be considered a nonlinear generalization of the classic Bush-Mosteller algorithm. Our model allows us to analyze and present a theoretical explanation of a frequency boosting property, whereby the learner surpasses the fluency of the source by increasing the frequency of the most common input. We derive analytical expressions for the frequency of the learner, and also identify a class of update functions that exhibit frequency boosting. Applications to the Feature-Label-Order effect in learning are presented.","1251":"Since December 2019, China has been experiencing an outbreak of new infectious disease caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

The heterogeneous nature of AD processes suggests that a more diverse, systems-integrated strategy may identify new therapeutic hypotheses. Although many target hypotheses have arisen from systems-level modeling of human disease, in practice and for many reasons, it has proven challenging to translate them into drug discovery pipelines. First, many hypotheses implicate protein targets and\/or biological mechanisms that are under-studied, meaning there is a paucity of evidence to inform experimental strategies as well as high-quality reagents to perform them. Second, systems-level targets are predicted to act in concert, requiring adaptations in how we characterize new drug targets. Here we posit that the development and open distribution of high-quality experimental reagents and informatic outputs-termed target enabling packages (TEPs)-will catalyze rapid evaluation of emerging systems-integrated targets in AD by enabling parallel, independent, and unencumbered research.","1253":"Viruses like influenza are infamous for their ability to adapt to new hosts. Retrospective studies of natural zoonoses and passaging in the lab have identified a modest number of host-adaptive mutations. However, it is unclear if these mutations represent all ways that influenza can adapt to a new host. Here we take a prospective approach to this question by completely mapping amino-acid mutations to the avian influenza virus polymerase protein PB2 that enhance growth in human cells. We identify numerous previously uncharacterized human-adaptive mutations. These mutations cluster on PB2's surface, highlighting potential interfaces with host factors. Some previously uncharacterized adaptive mutations occur in avian-to-human transmission of H7N9 influenza, showing their importance for natural virus evolution. But other adaptive mutations do not occur in nature because they are inaccessible via single-nucleotide mutations. Overall, our work shows how selection at key molecular surfaces combines with evolutionary accessibility to shape viral host adaptation.","1254":"Our browsable gallery is available at http:\/\/gevit.net and all project code can be found at https:\/\/github.com\/amcrisan\/gevitAnalysisRelease.We have developed a method that systematically surveys data visualizations using the analysis of both text and images.

We applied our method to a corpus of scientific research articles from infectious disease genomic epidemiology and derived a Genomic Epidemiology Visualization Typology (GEViT) that describes how visualizations were created from a series of chart types, combinations and enhancements. We have also implemented an online gallery that allows others to explore our resulting design space of visualizations. Our results have important implications for visualization design and for researchers intending to develop or use data visualization tools. Finally, the method that we introduce is extensible to constructing visualizations design spaces across other research areas.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.Data visualization is an important tool for exploring and communicating findings from genomic and healthcare datasets. Yet, without a systematic way of organizing and describing the design space of data visualizations, researchers may not be aware of the breadth of possible visualization design choices or how to distinguish between good and bad options.","1255":"Clinical drivers of RBC usage within the public and private healthcare sectors in South Africa differ significantly. Disparate pre-transfusion Hb between the sectors are likely due to differing disease profiles and severity, as well as differences in practice in prescribing transfusions. Implementation of a nationally co-ordinated Patient Blood Management programme may help to address these disparities and help ensure a sustainable blood transfusion system.Between 2014 and 2019, 2,356,411 public and private sector RBC transfusion events resulted in the issue of 4,020,094 RBC units (1,553,159 transfusion events and 2,495,054 units within the public sector versus 803,282 transfusion events and 1,525,040 units in private). The dominant clinical disciplines within the public sector were Medical (32.9%), Gynaecology\/Obstetrics (27.3%), General Surgery (13.6%), and Paediatrics (including Paediatric Surgery) (6.5%), compared to Intensive Care Units (33.2%), Medical (28.3%), General Surgery (10.4%), and Haematology\/Oncology (8.3%) in the private sector. Median pre-transfusion Hb values for 2018 were lower in the public than in the private sector: 6.9 g\/dL public sector versus 8 g\/dL private sector.South Africa aims to transition from a two-tiered healthcare system (public and private) to universal health coverage. Data on red blood cell (RBC) product usage reveal disparities between the sectors. Blood transfusion services further need to understand differing disease profiles and transfusion prescribing practices between the sectors to ensure blood security should the transition to a two-tiered health system come to fruition.Operational data for public and private healthcare RBC requests between 1 January 2014 and 31 March 2019, obtained from the South African National Blood Service (SANBS), were retrospectively analysed. Sector-specific demographic and utilisation trends were compared for the dominant clinical disciplines. Pre-transfusion haemoglobin (Hb) patterns were also delineated for 2018.","1256":"The Enterics for Global Health (EFGH) Peru site will enroll subjects in a periurban area of the low Amazon rainforest. The political department of Loreto lags behind most of Peru in access to improved sources of water and sanitation, per capita income, children born <2.5\u2005kg, and infant and child mortality. Chronic undernutrition as manifested by linear growth shortfalls is common, but wasting and acute malnutrition are not.The recruitment of children seeking care for acute diarrheal disease takes place at a geographic cluster of government-based primary care centers in an area where most residents are beneficiaries of free primary healthcare.Rates of diarrheal disease, dysentery, and Shigella are known to be high in the region, with some of the highest rates of disease documented in the literature and little evidence in improvement over the last 2 decades. This study will update estimates of shigellosis by measuring the prevalence of Shigella by polymerase chain reaction and culture in children seeking care and deriving population-based estimates by measuring healthcare seeking at the community level.Immunization has been offered universally against rotavirus in the region since 2009, and in a context where adequate water and sanitation are unlikely to obtain high standards in the near future, control of principal enteropathogens through immunization may be the most feasible way to decrease the high burden of disease in the area in the near future.","1257":"During the early stage of an epidemic, timely and reliable estimation of the severity of infections are important for predicting the impact that the influenza viruses will have in the population. We obtained age-specific deaths and hospitalizations for patients with laboratory-confirmed H1N1pdm09 infections from June 2009 to December 2009 in Hong Kong. We retrospectively obtained the real-time estimates of the hospitalization fatality risk (HFR), using crude estimation or allowing for right-censoring for final status in some patients. Models accounting for right-censoring performed better than models without adjustments. The risk of deaths in hospitalized patients with confirmed H1N1pdm09 increased with age. Reliable estimates of the HFR could be obtained before the peak of the first wave of H1N1pdm09 in young and middle-aged adults but after the peak in the elderly. In the next influenza pandemic, timely estimation of the HFR will contribute to risk assessment and disease control.","1258":"This mathematical modelling study was done to assess the UK Government's four-step process to easing lockdown restrictions in England, UK. We extended a previously described model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to incorporate vaccination and multi-strain dynamics to explicitly capture the emergence of the delta variant. We calibrated the model to English surveillance data, including hospital admissions, hospital occupancy, seroprevalence data, and population-level PCR testing data using a Bayesian evidence synthesis framework, then modelled the potential trajectory of the epidemic for a range of different schedules for relaxing NPIs. We estimated the resulting number of daily infections and hospital admissions, and daily and cumulative deaths. Three scenarios spanning a range of optimistic to pessimistic vaccine effectiveness, waning natural immunity, and cross-protection from previous infections were investigated. We also considered three levels of mixing after the lifting of restrictions.Our findings show that the risk of a large wave of COVID-19 hospital admissions resulting from lifting NPIs can be substantially mitigated if the timing of NPI relaxation is carefully balanced against vaccination coverage. However, with the delta variant, it might not be possible to fully lift NPIs without a third wave of hospital admissions and deaths, even if vaccination coverage is high. Variants of concern, their transmissibility, vaccine uptake, and vaccine effectiveness must be carefully monitored as countries relax pandemic control measures.The roadmap policy was successful in offsetting the increased transmission resulting from lifting NPIs starting on March 8, 2021, with increasing population immunity through vaccination. However, because of the emergence of the delta variant, with an estimated transmission advantage of 76% (95% credible interval [95% CrI] 69-83) over alpha, fully lifting NPIs on June 21, 2021, as originally planned might have led to 3900 (95% CrI 1500-5700) peak daily hospital admissions under our central parameter scenario. Delaying until July 19, 2021, reduced peak hospital admissions by three fold to 1400 (95% CrI 700-1700) per day. There was substantial uncertainty in the epidemic trajectory, with particular sensitivity to the transmissibility of delta, level of mixing, and estimates of vaccine effectiveness.National Institute for Health Research, UK Medical Research Council, Wellcome Trust, and UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.England's COVID-19 roadmap out of lockdown policy set out the timeline and conditions for the stepwise lifting of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as vaccination roll-out continued, with step one starting on March 8, 2021. In this study, we assess the roadmap, the impact of the delta (B.1.617.2) variant of SARS-CoV-2, and potential future epidemic trajectories.","1259":" based on when and how the multi-omics data are processed for clustering.

During period 1 (October 2012-May 2013), we used a \"traditional\" diarrhea case definition (\u22653 loose\/liquid stools within 24 hours). During period 2 (June 2013-August 2015), we used an expanded case definition of AGE (by adding \u22652 vomiting episodes without diarrhea or 1-2 vomiting episodes plus 1-2 loose\/liquid stools within 24 hours). Stool samples were tested for norovirus by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.During period 1, overall diarrhea and norovirus-associated diarrhea incidence was 37.2\/100 person-years (PY) (95% confidence interval [CI], 33.2-41.7) and 5.7\/100 PY (95% CI, 3.9-8.1), respectively. During period 2, overall AGE and norovirus-associated AGE incidence was 51.8\/100 PY (95% CI, 48.8-54.9) and 6.5\/100 PY (95% CI, 5.4-7.8), respectively. In both periods, children aged <2 years had the highest incidence of norovirus. Vomiting without diarrhea occurred among norovirus cases in participants <15 years old, but with a higher proportion among children <2 years, accounting for 35% (7\/20) of all cases in this age group. Noroviruses were identified in 7% (23\/335) of controls free of gastroenteric symptoms.Data on norovirus epidemiology among all ages in community settings are scarce, especially from tropical settings.Norovirus was a significant cause of AGE in this community, especially among children <2 years of age. Inclusion of vomiting in the case definition resulted in a 20% improvement for detection of norovirus cases.","1261":"Engagement in condomless receptive and insertive anal intercourse with one or more partners in the preceding 3 months was common (39.7% and 43.1% respectively) and was associated with several app-use contexts. For example, significant associations (P<0.05) were observed between alcohol and other drug use when using these apps and engagement in condomless receptive and insertive anal intercourse.MSM (n=174) in New York City were recruited through Grindr, a geosocial-networking app popular among MSM, using broadcast advertisements asking MSM to complete an Internet-based survey about their app use and sexual behaviours. Log-binomial regression models were fit to assess the association between each of the six app-use contexts (e.g. using apps when lonely, when drinking) and engagement in condomless insertive and receptive anal intercourse with one or more partners in the past 3 months.Given that 57.5% of respondents had engaged in condomless anal intercourse in the preceding 3 months and the associations of app-use contexts with condomless sexual behaviours, these findings suggest that reductions in substance use may lead to safer sexual practices among MSM who use apps to meet sexual partners.Background Geosocial-networking smartphone applications (apps) have been used increasingly by men who have sex with men (MSM) to meet new sexual partners. The purpose of this study was to examine associations between contexts of app use (e.g. using apps when drinking) and condomless anal intercourse among a sample of MSM who use these apps.","1262":"The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the poor ability of body temperature to reliably identify SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, an observation that has been made before in the context of other infectious diseases. While acute infection does not always cause fever, it does reliably drive host transcriptional responses as the body responds at the site of infection. These transcriptional changes can occur both in cells that are directly harboring replicating pathogens and in cells elsewhere that receive a molecular signal that infection is occurring. Here, we identify a core set of approximately 70 human genes that are together upregulated in cultured human cells infected by a broad array of viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens. We have named these \"core response\" genes. In theory, transcripts from these genes could serve as biomarkers of infection in the human body, in a way that is agnostic to the specific pathogen causing infection. As such, we perform human studies to show that these infection-induced human transcripts can be measured in the saliva of people harboring different types of infections. The number of these transcripts in saliva can correctly classify infection status (whether a person harbors an infection) 91% of the time. Furthermore, in the case of SARS-CoV-2 specifically, the number of core response transcripts in saliva correctly identifies infectious individuals even when enrollees, themselves, are asymptomatic and do not know they are infected.IMPORTANCEThere are a variety of clinical and laboratory criteria available to clinicians in controlled healthcare settings to help them identify whether an infectious disease is present. However, in situations such as a new epidemic caused by an unknown infectious agent, in health screening contexts performed within communities and outside of healthcare facilities or in battlefield or potential biowarfare situations, this gets more difficult. Pathogen-agnostic methods for rapid screening and triage of large numbers of people for infection status are needed, in particular methods that might work on an easily accessible biospecimen like saliva. Here, we identify a small, core set of approximately 70 human genes whose transcripts serve as saliva-based biomarkers of infection in the human body, in a way that is agnostic to the specific pathogen causing infection.","1263":" gene region. Multiple non-synonymous variants were found in USA-based isolates in regions associated with antiviral resistance. Evidence of recombination was detected between ELAL-1 and BTU-1.

We calibrated these models using prevalence data from Maputo, Mozambique and estimates of attributable fraction of transmission pathways for the region. We simulated the prevalence of human infection after reducing transmission through each pathway.The burden of diarrheal diseases remains high among children in low-income countries. Enteropathogens are challenging to control because they are transmitted via multiple pathways. Chickens are an important animal protein source, but live chickens and their products are often highly contaminated with enteropathogens.Our transmission models showed that the foodborne transmission has to be reduced to control enteropathogen infections in our study site, and likely in other similar contexts, but mitigation of this transmission pathway has not received sufficient attention. Our model can serve as a tool to identify effective mitigation opportunities to control zoonotic enteropathogens. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1289\/EHP12314.We conducted this study to a) understand the contribution of multiple transmission pathways to the force of infection of Campylobacter spp. and nontyphoidal Salmonella spp., b) quantify the potential impact of reducing each pathway on human infection, and c) quantify hypothesized pathway reduction from the context of Maputo, Mozambique.Simulation results indicated that if foodborne transmission were reduced by 90%, the prevalence of Campylobacter and Salmonella infection would decline by [52.2%; 95% credible interval (CrI): 39.7, 63.8] and (46.9%; 95% CrI: 39, 55.4), respectively. Interruption of any other pathway did not have a substantial impact. Combined with survey and microbiology data, if contamination of broiler chicken meat at informal markets in Maputo could be reduced by 90%, the total infection of Campylobacter and Salmonella could be reduced by 21% (16-26%) and 12% (10-13%), respectively.","1265":"We conducted a systematic literature review of general population testing, contact tracing, case isolation and contact quarantine interventions to assess their effectiveness in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, as implemented in real-world settings. We designed a broad search strategy and aimed to identify peer-reviewed studies of any design provided there was a quantitative measure of effectiveness on a transmission outcome. Studies that assessed the effect of testing or diagnosis on disease outcomes via treatment, but did not assess a transmission outcome, were not included. We focused on interventions implemented among the general population rather than in specific settings; these were from anywhere in the world and published any time after 1 January 2020 until the end of 2022. From 26\u2009720 titles and abstracts, 1181 were reviewed as full text, and 25 met our inclusion criteria. These 25 studies included one randomized control trial (RCT) and the remaining 24 analysed empirical data and made some attempt to control for confounding. Studies included were categorized by the type of intervention: contact tracing (seven studies); specific testing strategies (12 studies); strategies for isolating cases\/contacts (four studies); and 'test, trace, isolate' (TTI) as a part of a package of interventions (two studies). None of the 25 studies were rated at low risk of bias and many were rated as serious risk of bias, particularly due to the likely presence of uncontrolled confounding factors, which was a major challenge in assessing the independent effects of TTI in observational studies. These confounding factors are to be expected from observational studies during an on-going pandemic, when the emphasis was on reducing the epidemic burden rather than trial design. Findings from these 25 studies suggested an important public health role for testing followed by isolation, especially where mass and serial testing was used to reduce transmission. Some of the most compelling analyses came from examining fine-grained within-country data on contact tracing; while broader studies which compared behaviour between countries also often found TTI led to reduced transmission and mortality, this was not universal. There was limited evidence for the benefit of isolation of cases\/contacts away from the home environment. One study, an RCT, showed that daily testing of contacts could be a viable strategy to replace lengthy quarantine of contacts. Based on the scarcity of robust empirical evidence, we were not able to draw any firm quantitative conclusions about the quantitative impact of TTI interventions in different epidemic contexts. While the majority of studies found that testing, tracing and isolation reduced transmission, evidence for the scale of this impact is only available for specific scenarios and hence is not necessarily generalizable. Our review therefore emphasizes the need to conduct robust experimental studies that help inform the likely quantitative impact of different TTI interventions on transmission and their optimal design. Work is needed to support such studies in the context of future emerging epidemics, along with assessments of the cost-effectiveness of TTI interventions, which was beyond the scope of this review but will be critical to decision-making. This article is part of the theme issue 'The effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the COVID-19 pandemic: the evidence'.","1266":"Communicable diseases are often virulent, i.e. they cause morbidity symptoms in those infected. While some symptoms may be transmission-enhancing, other symptoms are likely to reduce transmission potential. For human diseases, the reduction in transmission opportunities is commonly caused by reduced activity. There is limited data regarding the potential impact of virulence on transmission potential. We performed an exploratory data analysis of 324 influenza patients at a university health centre during the 2016\/2017 influenza season. We classified symptoms as infectiousness-related or morbidity-related and calculated two scores. The scores were used to explore the relationship between infectiousness, morbidity (virulence), and activity level. We found a decrease in the activity level with increasing morbidity scores. There was no consistent pattern between an activity level and an infectiousness score. We also found a positive correlation between morbidity and infectiousness scores. Overall, we find that increasing virulence leads to increased infectiousness and reduced activity, suggesting a trade-off that can impact overall transmission potential. Our findings indicate that a reduction of systemic symptoms may increase host activity without reducing infectiousness. Therefore, interventions should target both systemic- and infectiousness-related symptoms to reduce overall transmission potential. Our findings can also inform simulation models that investigate the impact of different interventions on transmission.","1267":"Agent states and transitions between states are important abstractions in agent-based social simulation (ABSS). Although it is common to develop ad hoc implementations of state-based and transition-based agent behaviors, \"best practice\" software engineering processes provide transparent and formally grounded design notations that translate directly into working implementations. Statecharts are a software engineering design methodology and an explicit visual and logical representation of the states of system components and the transitions between those states. Used in ABSS, they can clarify a model's logic and allow for efficient software engineering of complex state-based models. In addition to agent state and behavioral logic representation, visual statecharts can also be useful for monitoring agent status during a simulation, quickly conveying the underlying dynamics of complex models as a simulation evolves over time. Visual approaches include drag-and-drop editing capabilities for constructing state-based models of agent behaviors and conditions for agent state transitions. Repast Simphony is a widely used, open source, and freely accessible agent-based modeling toolkit. While it is possible for Repast Simphony users to create their own implementations of state-based agent behaviors and even create dynamic agent state visualizations, the effort involved in doing so is usually prohibitive. The new statecharts framework in Repast Simphony, a subset of Harel's statecharts, introduces software engineering practices through the use of statecharts that directly translate visual representations of agent states and behaviors into software implementations. By integrating an agent statecharts framework into Repast Simphony, we have made it easier for users at all levels to take advantage of this important modeling paradigm. Through the visual programming that statecharts afford, users can effectively create the software underlying agents and agent-based models. This paper describes the development and use of the free and open source Repast Simphony statecharts capability for developing ABSS models.","1268":"We applied the generalized-growth model to 20 infectious disease outbreaks representing a range of transmission routes. We uncovered epidemic profiles ranging from very slow growth (p=0.14 for the Ebola outbreak in Bomi, Liberia (2014)) to near exponential (p>0.9 for the smallpox outbreak in Khulna (1972), and the 1918 pandemic influenza in San Francisco). The foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Uruguay displayed a profile of slower growth while the growth pattern of the HIV\/AIDS epidemic in Japan was approximately linear. The West African Ebola epidemic provided a unique opportunity to explore how growth profiles vary by geography; analysis of the largest district-level outbreaks revealed substantial growth variations (mean p=0.59, range: 0.14-0.97). The districts of Margibi in Liberia and Bombali and Bo in Sierra Leone had near-exponential growth, while the districts of Bomi in Liberia and Kenema in Sierra Leone displayed near constant incidences.We introduce a 2-parameter generalized-growth model to characterize the ascending phase of an outbreak and capture epidemic profiles ranging from sub-exponential to exponential growth. We test the model against empirical outbreak data representing a variety of viral pathogens in historic and contemporary populations, and provide simulations highlighting the importance of sub-exponential growth for forecasting purposes.Our findings reveal significant variation in epidemic growth patterns across different infectious disease outbreaks and highlights that sub-exponential growth is a common phenomenon, especially for pathogens that are not airborne. Sub-exponential growth profiles may result from heterogeneity in contact structures or risk groups, reactive behavior changes, or the early onset of interventions strategies, and consideration of \"deceleration parameters\" may be useful to refine existing mathematical transmission models and improve disease forecasts.A better characterization of the early growth dynamics of an epidemic is needed to dissect the important drivers of disease transmission, refine existing transmission models, and improve disease forecasts.","1269":"This study uses a mathematical model to compare different adaptive nonpharmaceutical intervention (NPI) strategies for COVID-19 management across 3 dimensions: threshold when the NPI should be implemented, time it takes to implement the NPI, and the effectiveness of the NPI.All adaptive NPI response scenarios considered substantially reduced peak hospitalizations compared with no response.Slower NPI implementation results in a somewhat higher peak hospitalization and longer time spent with the NPI in place but may make an adaptive strategy more feasible by allowing the population sufficient time to prepare for changing restrictions.A stronger, more effective NPI response results in a modest reduction in the time spent under the NPIs and slightly lower peak hospitalizations.A higher threshold for triggering the NPI delays the time at which the NPI starts but results in a higher peak hospitalization and does not substantially reduce the time the NPI remains in force.Background. To support proactive decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic, mathematical models have been leveraged to identify surveillance indicator thresholds at which strengthening nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is necessary to protect health care capacity. Understanding tradeoffs between different adaptive COVID-19 response components is important when designing strategies that balance public preference and public health goals. Methods. We considered 3 components of an adaptive COVID-19 response: 1) the threshold at which to implement the NPI, 2) the time needed to implement the NPI, and 3) the effectiveness of the NPI. Using a compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission calibrated to Minnesota state data, we evaluated different adaptive policies in terms of the peak number of hospitalizations and the time spent with the NPI in force. Scenarios were compared with a reference strategy, in which an NPI with an 80% contact reduction was triggered when new weekly hospitalizations surpassed 8 per 100,000 population, with a 7-day implementation period. Assumptions were varied in sensitivity analysis. Results. All adaptive response scenarios substantially reduced peak hospitalizations relative to no response. Among adaptive response scenarios, slower NPI implementation resulted in somewhat higher peak hospitalization and a longer time spent under the NPIs than the reference scenario. A stronger NPI response resulted in slightly less time with the NPIs in place and smaller hospitalization peak. A higher trigger threshold resulted in greater peak hospitalizations with little reduction in the length of time under the NPIs. Conclusions. An adaptive NPI response can substantially reduce infection circulation and prevent health care capacity from being exceeded. However, population preferences as well as the feasibility and timeliness of compliance with reenacting NPIs should inform response design.","1270":"We used national age-specific estimates of 2017-2018 influenza vaccine coverage and disease burden. We estimated VE against medically attended reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed influenza virus infection in the ambulatory setting using a test-negative design. We used a compartmental model to estimate numbers of influenza-associated outcomes prevented by vaccination.The severity of the 2017-2018 influenza season in the United States was high, with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating. Here, we report influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) and estimate the number of vaccine-prevented influenza-associated illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths for the 2017-2018 influenza season.Despite 38% VE, influenza vaccination reduced a substantial burden of influenza-associated illness, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States during the 2017-2018 season. Our results demonstrate the benefit of current influenza vaccination and the need for improved vaccines.The VE against outpatient, medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza was 38% (95% confidence interval [CI], 31%-43%), including 22% (95% CI, 12%-31%) against influenza A(H3N2), 62% (95% CI, 50%-71%) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 50% (95% CI, 41%-57%) against influenza B. We estimated that influenza vaccination prevented 7.1 million (95% CrI, 5.4 million-9.3 million) illnesses, 3.7 million (95% CrI, 2.8 million-4.9 million) medical visits, 109 000 (95% CrI, 39 000-231 000) hospitalizations, and 8000 (95% credible interval [CrI], 1100-21 000) deaths. Vaccination prevented 10% of expected hospitalizations overall and 41% among young children (6 months-4 years).","1271":"Little is known about how pharmacists' attitudes and stigma toward naloxone and Medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) influence effective linkage to treatment. We examine the psychometrics of a new Pharmacist Opioid Use Disorder Perceptions Questionnaire (P-OUDP-Q), a multidimensional measure to examine pharmacists' stigma and perceptions related to MOUD in the New York State (NYS) site of the HEALing Communities Study.Eighty-six percent (n\u00a0=\u00a0280) of the pharmacists were white. A little over half, 57\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a0186), were female, 35\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a0113) were 30-35\u00a0years old. The mean number of years practicing (SD) was 18 (SD: 13). Exploratory factor analysis identified four underlying constructs: (1) practice confidence, (2) practice familiarity, (3) practice attitudes, and (4) methadone attitudes. Statistically significant (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) mean factor scale score differences by race were observed for practice familiarity (white reporting higher than non-white); by pharmacy size for practice familiarity (across all groups; non-significant Tukey post-hoc) and practice attitudes (hospital\/clinic greater than big chain pharmacies); by gender (males greater than females) for practice familiarity and methadone attitudes; by poverty quartile for practice attitudes (lowest less than highest quartile); and urban versus rural pharmacist county setting for practice familiarity (rural greater than urban).The study recruited a sample of 324 pharmacists from 16 counties in NYS between January and June 2022. A 74-item questionnaire assessed pharmacists' familiarity with opioid-related medications, protocols, policies and attitudes regarding their role, confidence, and beliefs centered around delivery of MOUD and naloxone in the community. Exploratory factor analysis assessed individual and community-level factors associated with four underlying constructs. Factor scores were compared across the demographic predictors. Variables factor loadings <0.4 were eliminated from the factor analysis and the process was reiterated.Findings show the P-OUDP-Q is a concise measure of pharmacists' perceptions of their role in dispensing MOUD and naloxone, including distinct \"stigma\" dimensions, which is valuable for use with pharmacists in communities highly impacted by the opioid epidemic. The development and validation of a reliable measure to assess pharmacists' perceptions of stigma and barriers represents a valuable contribution to the field, to inform the design\/implementation of targeted interventions and support systems.","1272":"The advent of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has transformed the landscape of hepatitis C virus (HCV) management. We aimed to prospectively (real-time) evaluate the feasibility of using a response-guided therapy approach, based on mathematical modeling of early viral kinetics, to reduce the duration of DAAs therapy. Patients were treated with DAAs according to the physicians' preference. HCV was measured at baseline and at day 2 and weeks 1, 2 and 4 after treatment initiation. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with sustained-virological response (SVR) at 12 and\/or 24\u00a0weeks post-treatment. Twenty-nine patients (mean age 54\u2009\u00b1\u200916, 44% females, 73% with HCV genotype 1), were enrolled and all completed therapy. Treatment duration was shortened in 11 of the 29 patients (38%). SVR was achieved in 28 of the 29 patients (97%). Relapse occurred post treatment in a single case of a non-cirrhotic male with genotype 3, who was treated with sofosbuvir\/velpatasvir for 6\u00a0weeks. Virus sequencing did not identify baseline or treatment emergent resistance associated substitutions. Real-time mathematical modeling of early HCV kinetics can be utilized for shortening DAAs duration in approximately 40% of patients without compromising treatment efficacy.Clinical trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03603327.","1273":"This was a pragmatic cluster-randomised, parallel group, superiority trial conducted in 34 general practices in London, UK, comparing LTBI treatment in recent migrants in primary care to secondary care. The primary outcome was treatment completion, defined as taking at least 90% of antibiotic doses. Secondary outcomes included treatment acceptance, adherence, adverse effects, patient satisfaction, TB-incidence and a cost-effectiveness analysis. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03069807). Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.Between September 2016 and May 2019, 362 recent migrants with LTBI were offered treatment and 276 accepted. Treatment completion was similar in primary and secondary care (82\u00b76% versus 86\u00b70%, aOR:0\u00b764, 95%CI:0\u00b731-1\u00b729). There was no difference in drug induced liver injury (DILI) between primary and secondary care (0\u00b77% versus 2\u00b73%, aOR:0\u00b729, 95%CI:0\u00b703-2\u00b784). Treatment acceptance was lower in primary care (65\u00b72% (146\/224) versus 94.2% (130\/138), aOR:0\u00b710, 95%CI:0\u00b703-0\u00b731). The estimated cost per patient completing treatment was lower in primary care, with an incremental saving of \u00a3315. 27(\u00a3313.47-\u00a3317.07).The treatment of LTBI in recent migrants within primary care does not result in higher rates of treatment completion but is safe and costs less when compared to secondary care.Control of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is a priority in the World Health Organization strategy to eliminate tuberculosis (TB). Many high-income low TB incidence countries have prioritised LTBI screening and treatment in recent migrants. We tested whether a novel model of care, based entirely within primary care, was effective and safe as compared to secondary care.","1274":"Huanglongbing (HLB), or citrus greening, is a global citrus disease occurring in almost all citrus growing regions. It causes substantial economic burdens to individual growers, citrus industries and governments. Successful management strategies to reduce disease burden are desperately needed but with so many possible interventions and combinations thereof it is difficult to know which are worthwhile or cost-effective. We review how mathematical models have yielded useful insights into controlling disease spread for other vector-borne plant diseases, and the small number of mathematical models of HLB. We adapt a malaria model to HLB, by including temperature-dependent psyllid traits, \"flushing\" of trees, and economic costs, to show how models can be used to highlight the parameters that require more data collection or that should be targeted for intervention. We analyze the most common intervention strategy, insecticide spraying, to determine the most cost-effective spraying strategy. We find that fecundity and feeding rate of the vector require more experimental data collection, for wider temperatures ranges. Also, the best strategy for insecticide intervention is to spray for more days rather than pay extra for a more efficient spray. We conclude that mathematical models are able to provide useful recommendations for managing HLB spread.","1275":"COVID-19 pandemic-related shifts in healthcare utilization, in combination with trends in non-COVID-19 disease transmission and non-pharmaceutical intervention use, had clear impacts on rates of hospitalization for infectious and chronic diseases. Using a U.S. national healthcare billing database, we estimated the monthly incidence rate ratio of hospitalizations between March 2020 and June 2021 according to 19 ICD-10 diagnostic chapters and 189 subchapters. The majority of primary diagnoses for hospitalization showed an immediate decline in incidence during March 2020. Hospitalizations for reproductive neoplasms, hypertension, and diabetes returned to pre-pandemic levels during late 2020 and early 2021, while others, like those for infectious respiratory disease, did not return to pre-pandemic levels during this period. Our assessment of subchapter-level primary hospitalization codes offers insight into trends among less frequent causes of hospitalization during the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S.","1276":"The Philippines is experiencing an HIV crisis and is considering implementing pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as a national public health strategy for HIV prevention for cisgender men who have sex with men (cis-MSM). However, critical information on the awareness of PrEP among cis-MSM is needed to roll out this public health initiative.This study aims to assess PrEP awareness and related correlates (ie, sociodemographic variables, social factors, and health care access and use) among Filipino cis-MSM.We conducted a web-based survey with Filipino cis-MSM (n=179) residing in the cities of Manila and Cebu, Philippines. Multivariable analysis procedures were performed to examine the factors associated with PrEP awareness.Our sample demonstrated high awareness (134\/179, 74.9%) and interest (159\/179, 88.8%) in taking PrEP. The adjusted model showed that greater odds of PrEP awareness were associated with having a college education or higher versus a high school education or lower (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 7.30, 95% CI 1.01-52.47), earning between PHP 10,000 (US $198.6) and PHP 20,000 (US $397.2) versus <PHP 10,000 (US $198.60; aOR 9.32, 95% CI 1.41-6.22), having had a prior HIV test (aOR 6.06, 95% CI 1.20-13.55), having high HIV knowledge (aOR 3.50, 95% CI 1.11-10.98), and having friends who discussed PrEP (aOR 11.17, 95% CI 2.73-14.5).Our findings demonstrate that Filipino cis-MSM are aware of and interested in taking PrEP, but there is currently an unmet need for such biomedical HIV prevention technologies among this population. Incorporating PrEP education into routine HIV screening and leveraging cis-MSM social networks may be useful in optimizing potential PrEP implementation in the Philippines.","1277":"Compared to surveillance based on hospital admissions, outpatient sentinel surveillance that captured at least 20% of incident mild cases could trigger an alarm 2 to 5 days earlier for a mild increase in transmission and 6 days earlier for a moderate or strong increase. Sentinel surveillance triggered fewer false alarms and averted more deaths per day spent in mitigation. When transmission increase in older populations lagged the increase in younger populations by 14 days, sentinel surveillance extended its lead time over hospital admissions by an additional 2 days.We used a stochastic, compartmental transmission model to evaluate the performance of various surveillance indicators at reliably triggering an alarm in response to, but not before, a step increase in transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The surveillance indicators included hospital admissions, hospital occupancy, and sentinel cases with varying levels of sampling effort capturing 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100% of incident mild cases. We tested 3 levels of transmission increase, 3 population sizes, and conditions of either simultaneous transmission increase or lagged increase in the older population. We compared the indicators' performance at triggering alarm soon after, but not prior, to the transmission increase.Sentinel surveillance of mild symptomatic cases can provide more timely and reliable information on changes in transmission to inform decision-makers in an epidemic like COVID-19.Decision-makers impose COVID-19 mitigations based on public health indicators such as reported cases, which are sensitive to fluctuations in supply and demand for diagnostic testing, and hospital admissions, which lag infections by up to two weeks. Imposing mitigations too early has unnecessary economic costs while imposing too late leads to uncontrolled epidemics with unnecessary cases and deaths. Sentinel surveillance of recently-symptomatic individuals in outpatient testing sites may overcome biases and lags in conventional indicators, but the minimal outpatient sentinel surveillance system needed for reliable trend estimation remains unknown.","1278":"Infamous for \u0093Mad hatter syndrome\u0094 and \u0093Minamata disease\u0094, mercury (Hg) is ranked high on the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry's priority list of hazardous substances for its potent neurologic, renal, and developmental toxicities. Most typical exposures are via contaminated water and food. Although regulations and advisories are exercised at various levels, Hg pollution from both natural and anthropogenic sources has remained a major public health and safety concern. Rapid detection of solvated aqueous Hg2 + ions at low levels is critical for immediate response and protection of those who are vulnerable (young children, pregnant and breast-feeding women) to acute and chronic exposures to Hg2 +. Various types of sensors capable of detecting Hg in water have been developed. In particular, the novel use of engineered carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has garnered attention due to their specificity and sensitivity towards Hg2 + detection in solution. In this focused review, we describe the sensitivity, selectivity and mechanisms of Hg2 + ion sensing at trace levels by employing CNT-based various sensor designs, and appraise the open literature on the currently applied and \u0093proof-of-concept\u0094 methods. Five different types of CNT-based sensor systems are described: potentiometric, DNA-based fluorescence, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), colorimetric, and stripping voltammetric assays. In addition, the recognized merits and shortcomings for each type of electrochemical sensors are discussed. The knowledge from this succinct review shall guide the development of the next generation CNT-based biochemical sensors for rapid Hg2 + detection in the environment, which is a significant first step towards human health risk analysis of this legacy toxicant.","1279":"Over the past 2 decades, incident infections drove incident HIV cluster growth in San Diego. The current CDC EHE molecular detection and response strategy would not have identified most transmission events arising from those with incident infection in San Diego. Molecular surveillance that includes detection of incident cases will provide a more effective strategy for EHE.Ending the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic requires knowledge of key drivers of spread of HIV infection.Between 1996 and 2018, 1119 newly and previously diagnosed, therapy-naive persons with HIV (PWH) from San Diego were followed. A genetic distance-based network was inferred using pol sequences, and genetic clusters grew over time through linkage of sequences from newly observed infections. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify factors associated with the rate of growth. These results were used to predict the impact of a hypothetical intervention targeting PWH with incident infection. Comparison was made to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) molecular surveillance strategy, which prioritizes clusters recently linked to all new HIV diagnoses and does not incorporate data on incident infections.Overall, 219 genetic linkages to incident infections were identified over a median follow-up of 8.8 years. Incident cluster growth was strongly associated with proportion of PWH in the cluster who themselves had incident infection (hazard ratio, 44.09 [95% confidence interval, 17.09-113.78]). The CDC EHE molecular surveillance strategy identified 11 linkages to incident infections a genetic distance threshold of 0.5%, and 24 linkages at 1.5%.","1280":"A multistate transition model was applied to data on 23,232 adults from Waves 1-4 (2013-2017) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study (analysis was conducted in 2020-2021). Transition rates among never, noncurrent, nonmenthol versus menthol cigarette, ENDS, and dual everyday\/someday use were estimated, as were transition-specific hazard ratios for age, sex, race\/ethnicity, education, and income.A better understanding of how menthol cigarette flavoring and ENDS impact smoking initiation, cessation, and transitions between tobacco products could help elucidate the potential impact of a U.S. menthol ban on combustible tobacco products.Non-Hispanic Blacks who smoked menthol discontinued smoking at a much lower rate than those who smoked nonmenthol (hazard ratio=0.43, 95% CI=0.29, 0.64), but there was no statistically significant difference in the discontinuation rates among non-Hispanic Whites (hazard ratio=0.97, 95% CI=0.80, 1.16) or Hispanics (hazard ratio=0.81, 95% CI=0.56, 1.16). Non-Hispanic Whites who smoked menthol were more likely to become dual users than those who smoked nonmenthol (hazard ratio=1.43, 95% CI=1.14, 1.80). Young adults initiated menthol smoking at a higher rate than older adults (age 18-24 years versus \u226555 years: hazard ratio=2.45, 95% CI=1.44, 4.15) but not nonmenthol smoking (hazard ratio=1.02, 95% CI=0.62, 1.69). There were differences by sex in the impact of menthol flavor on smoking initiation and discontinuation but little difference by education or income.Sociodemographic differences in product transitions should be accounted for when estimating the potential impact of a menthol ban.","1281":"We mapped current and future temperature suitability for malaria transmission in Africa using a published model that incorporates nonlinear physiological responses to temperature of the mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae and the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. We found that a larger area of Africa currently experiences the ideal temperature for transmission than previously supposed. Under future climate projections, we predicted a modest increase in the overall area suitable for malaria transmission, but a net decrease in the most suitable area. Combined with human population density projections, our maps suggest that areas with temperatures suitable for year-round, highest-risk transmission will shift from coastal West Africa to the Albertine Rift between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda, whereas areas with seasonal transmission suitability will shift toward sub-Saharan coastal areas. Mapping temperature suitability places important bounds on malaria transmissibility and, along with local level demographic, socioeconomic, and ecological factors, can indicate where resources may be best spent on malaria control. ","1282":"We use a Bayesian mixed effects model with auto-regressive terms to estimate the temporal relationships between disease transmission, excess deaths, changes in economic output, transit mobility and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) across countries.The COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 7.02 million deaths as of January 2024 and profoundly affected most countries' Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Here, we study the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, mortality, and economic output between January 2020 and December 2022 across 25 European countries.The interplay between transmission intensity, excess deaths, population mobility and economic output is highly complex, and none of these factors can be considered in isolation. Our results reinforce the intuitive idea that significant economic activity arises from diverse person-to-person interactions. Our analysis quantifies and highlights that the impact of disease on a given country is complex and multifaceted. Long-term economic impairments are not fully captured by our model, as well as long-term disease effects (Long COVID).Disease transmission intensity (logRt) decreases GDP and increases excess deaths, where the latter association is longer-lasting. Changes in GDP as well as prior week transmission intensity are both negatively associated with each other (-0.241, 95% CrI: -0.295 - -0.189). We find evidence of risk-averse behaviour, as changes in transit and prior week transmission intensity are negatively associated (-0.055, 95% CrI: -0.074 to -0.036). Our results highlight a complex cost-benefit trade-off from individual NPIs. For example, banning international travel is associated with both increases in GDP (0.014, 0.002-0.025) and decreases in excess deaths (-0.014, 95% CrI: -0.028 - -0.001). Country-specific random effects, such as the poverty rate, are positively associated with excess deaths while the UN government effectiveness index is negatively associated with excess deaths.","1283":"Residents in residential care homes for the elderly (RCHEs) are at high risk of severe illnesses and mortality, while staff have high exposure to intimate care activities. Addressing vaccine hesitancy is crucial to safeguard vaccine uptake in this vulnerable setting, especially amid a pandemic. In response to this, we conducted a cross-sectional survey to measure the level of vaccine hesitancy and to examine its associated factors among residents and staff in RCHEs in Hong Kong. We recruited residents and staff from 31 RCHEs in July-November 2022. Of 204 residents, 9.8% had a higher level of vaccine hesitancy (scored \u2265 4 out of 7, mean = 2.44). Around 7% of the staff (n = 168) showed higher vaccine hesitancy (mean = 2.45). From multi-level regression analyses, higher social loneliness, higher anxiety, poorer cognitive ability, being vaccinated with fewer doses, and lower institutional vaccination rates predicted residents' vaccine hesitancy. Similarly, higher emotional loneliness, higher anxiety, being vaccinated with fewer doses, and working in larger RCHEs predicted staff's vaccine hesitancy. Although the reliance on self-report data and convenience sampling may hamper the generalizability of the results, this study highlighted the importance of addressing the loneliness of residents and staff in RCHEs to combat vaccine hesitancy. Innovative and technology-aided interventions are needed to build social support and ensure social interactions among the residents and staff, especially amid outbreaks.","1284":" = 4).

In this study, we compare forecasts of TF prevalence in 2011 for 7 different statistical and mechanistic models across 9 de-identified trachoma endemic districts, representing 4 unique trachoma endemic countries. We forecast TF prevalence between 1-6 years ahead in time and compare the 7 different models to the observed 2011 data using a log-likelihood score. An SIS model, including a district-specific random effect for the district-specific transmission coefficient, had the highest log-likelihood score across all 9 districts and was therefore the best performing model. While overall the deterministic transmission model was the least well performing model, although it did comparably well to the other models for 8 of 9 districts. We perform a statistically rigorous comparison of the forecasting ability of a range of mathematical and statistical models across multiple endemic districts between 1 and 6 years ahead of the last collected TF prevalence data point in 2011, assessing results against surveillance data. This study is a step towards making statements about likelihood and time to elimination with regard to the WHO GET2020 goals.","1287":"Many persons with religious convictions report hesitancy about COVID-19 vaccines, in part due to ethical concerns that fetal cell lines are used in the development of certain vaccines. The issue of abortion is contentious and, given the potential impact on COVID-19 vaccination, it is important for clinicians to be aware of this issue, whatever their personal beliefs. I provide four responses that clinicians may offer their patients: 1) Ethical analyses of moral complicity and COVID vaccines. 2) Altruism and protecting others from a virus that is often transmitted while asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. 3) Religious texts and many religious leaders support prevention and, therefore, vaccination. 4) Administration of vaccines not developed in fetal cell lines. Although I wish for all my patients to be vaccinated, I respect their autonomy to make the choice to be or not to be vaccinated and understand that many have a deep regard for fetal life.","1288":"We estimated the fraction of antibiotic prescribing in the US attributable to gonorrhea.

The biology curriculum appears to be a crucial locus of intervention for either reinforcing or undermining students' racial essentialist views. The Mendelian genetic models dominating textbooks, particularly in combination with racially inflected language sometimes used when teaching about monogenic disorders, can increase middle and high school students' racial essentialism and opposition to policies to increase equity. These findings are of particular concern given the increasing spread of racist misinformation online and the misappropriation of human genomics research by white supremacists, who take advantage of low levels of genetics literacy in the general public. Encouragingly, however, teaching updated information about the geographical distribution of human genetic variation and the complex, multifactorial basis of most human traits, reduces students' endorsement of racial essentialism. The genetics curriculum is therefore a key tool in combating misinformation and scientific racism. Here, we describe a framework and example teaching materials for teaching students key concepts in genetics, human evolutionary history, and human phenotypic variation at the undergraduate level. This framework can be flexibly applied in biology and anthropology classes and adjusted based on time availability. Our goal is to provide undergraduate-level instructors with varying levels of expertise with a set of evidence-informed tools for teaching human genetics to combat scientific racism, including an evolving set of instructional resources, as well as learning goals and pedagogical approaches. Resources can be found at https:\/\/noto.li\/YIlhZ5. Additionally, we hope to generate conversation about integrating modern genetics into the undergraduate curriculum, in light of recent findings about the risks and opportunities associated with teaching genetics.","1290":"The unprecedented scale of the Ebola outbreak in Western Africa (2014-2015) has prompted an explosion of efforts to understand the transmission dynamics of the virus and to analyze the performance of possible containment strategies. Models have focused primarily on the reproductive numbers of the disease that represent the average number of secondary infections produced by a random infectious individual. However, these population-level estimates may conflate important systematic variation in the number of cases generated by infected individuals, particularly found in spatially localized transmission and superspreading events. Although superspreading features prominently in first-hand narratives of Ebola transmission, its dynamics have not been systematically characterized, hindering refinements of future epidemic predictions and explorations of targeted interventions. We used Bayesian model inference to integrate individual-level spatial information with other epidemiological data of community-based (undetected within clinical-care systems) cases and to explicitly infer distribution of the cases generated by each infected individual. Our results show that superspreaders play a key role in sustaining onward transmission of the epidemic, and they are responsible for a significant proportion ([Formula: see text]61%) of the infections. Our results also suggest age as a key demographic predictor for superspreading. We also show that community-based cases may have progressed more rapidly than those notified within clinical-care systems, and most transmission events occurred in a relatively short distance (with median value of 2.51 km). Our results stress the importance of characterizing superspreading of Ebola, enhance our current understanding of its spatiotemporal dynamics, and highlight the potential importance of targeted control measures.","1291":"From the base 15% PrEP coverage level, the three interventions could increase coverage to 27%, resulting in 12.3% of infections averted over 10\u200ayears. Uptake of each intervention was interdependent: maximal use of the adherence and persistence interventions depended on new PrEP users generated by the initiation intervention. As the budget increased, optimal investment involved a mixture of the initiation and persistence interventions, but not the adherence intervention. If adherence intervention costs were halved, the optimal investment was roughly equal across interventions.Investments into the PrEP cascade through initiatives should account for the interactions of the interventions as they are collectively deployed. Given current intervention efficacy estimates, the total population impact of each intervention may be improved with greater total budgets or reduced intervention costs.The model simulated MSM participating in up to three real-world PrEP cascade interventions designed to improve initiation, adherence, or persistence. The primary outcome was infections averted over 10\u200ayears. The budget optimization model identified the investment combination under different budgets that maximized this outcome given intervention costs from a payer perspective.Gaps between recommended and actual levels of HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use remain among men who have sex with men (MSM). Interventions can address these gaps, but it is unknown how public health initiatives should invest prevention funds into these interventions to maximize their population impact.We used a stochastic network-based HIV transmission model for MSM in the Atlanta area paired with an economic budget optimization model.","1292":"US guidelines recommend routine HIV screening of all adults and adolescents at least once. The population-level impact of this strategy is unclear and will vary across the country.We constructed a static linear model to estimate the optimal ages and incremental impact of adding one-time routine HIV screening to risk-based, prenatal, symptom-based, and partner notification testing. Using surveillance data and published studies, we parameterized the model at the national level and for two settings representing subnational variability in the rates and distribution of infection: King County, WA and Philadelphia County, PA. Screening strategies were evaluated in terms of the percent of tests that result in new diagnoses (test positivity), cumulative person-years of undiagnosed infection, and the number of symptomatic HIV\/AIDS cases.While routine HIV screening may contribute meaningfully to increased case detection in persons not captured by targeted testing programs in some settings, this strategy will have a limited impact on population-level outcomes. Our findings highlight the importance of a multipronged testing strategy with continued investment in risk-based screening programs.Depending on the frequency of risk-based screening, routine screening test positivity was maximized at ages 30-34 years in the national model. The optimal age for routine screening was higher in a setting with a lower proportion of cases among men who have sex with men. Across settings, routine screening resulted in incremental reductions of 3-8% in years of undiagnosed infection and 3-11% in symptomatic cases, compared to reductions of 36-69% and 41-76% attributable to risk-based screening.","1293":" is an ortholog of the plant protein Ycf4, which is necessary for expression of proteins of the photosynthetic photosystem 1 complex, itself also an NADPH oxio-reductase. We thus describe the key role of the previously uncharacterized protein Eros in host defense.","1294":"In marine ecosystems, oceanographic processes often govern host contacts with infectious agents. Consequently, many approaches developed to quantify pathogen dispersal in terrestrial ecosystems have limited use in the marine context. Recent applications in marine disease modeling demonstrate that physical oceanographic models coupled with biological models of infectious agents can characterize dispersal networks of pathogens in marine ecosystems. Biophysical modeling has been used over the past two decades to model larval dispersion but has only recently been utilized in marine epidemiology. In this review, we describe how biophysical models function and how they can be used to measure connectivity of infectious agents between sites, test hypotheses regarding pathogen dispersal, and quantify patterns of pathogen spread, focusing on fish and shellfish pathogens.","1295":"Neutrophils are one of the key players in the human innate immune system (HIIS). In the event of an insult where the body is exposed to inflammation triggering moieties (ITMs), neutrophils are mobilized towards the site of insult and antagonize the inflammation. If the inflammation is cleared, neutrophils go into a programmed death called apoptosis. However, if the insult is intense or persistent, neutrophils take on a violent death pathway called necrosis, which involves the rupture of their cytoplasmic content into the surrounding tissue that causes local tissue damage, thus further aggravating inflammation. This seemingly paradoxical phenomenon fuels the inflammatory process by triggering the recruitment of additional neutrophils to the site of inflammation, aimed to contribute to the complete neutralization of severe inflammation. This delicate balance between the cost and benefit of the neutrophils' choice of death pathway has been optimized during the evolution of the innate immune system. The goal of our work is to understand how the tradeoff between the cost and benefit of the different death pathways of neutrophils, in response to various levels of insults, has been optimized over evolutionary time by using the concepts of evolutionary game theory.By adopting an evolutionary perspective, we identify the driving mechanisms leading to the delicate balance between apoptosis and necrosis in neutrophils' cell death in response to different insults. Using our simple model, we verify that indeed, the global cost of remaining ITMs is the driving mechanism that reproduces the percentage of necrosis and apoptosis observed in data and neutrophils need sufficient information of the overall inflammation to be able to pick a death pathway that presumably increases the survival of the organism.We show that by using evolutionary game theory, we are able to formulate a game that predicts the percentage of necrosis and apoptosis when exposed to various levels of insults.","1296":"Chlamydia screening and PN as implemented in the United States from 2000 through 2015 has substantially improved population health and provided good value for money when considering associated health care services costs. Further population health gains are attainable by increasing screening further, at reasonable cost per QALY gained.Chlamydia remains a significant public health problem that contributes to adverse reproductive health outcomes. In the United States, sexually active women 24 years and younger are recommended to receive annual screening for chlamydia. In this study, we evaluated the impact of estimated current levels of screening and partner notification (PN), and the impact of screening based on guidelines on chlamydia associated sequelae, quality adjusted life years (QALYs) lost and costs.We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of chlamydia screening, using a published calibrated pair formation transmission model that estimated trends in chlamydia screening coverage in the United States from 2000 to 2015 consistent with epidemiological data. We used probability trees to translate chlamydial infection outcomes into estimated numbers of chlamydia-associated sequelae, QALYs lost, and health care services costs (in 2020 US dollars). We evaluated the costs and population health benefits of screening and PN in the United States for 2000 to 2015, as compared with no screening and no PN. We also estimated the additional benefits that could be achieved by increasing screening coverage to the levels indicated by the policy recommendations for 2016 to 2019, compared with screening coverage achieved by 2015.Screening and PN from 2000 to 2015 were estimated to have averted 1.3 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 490,000-2.3 million) cases of pelvic inflammatory disease, 430,000 (95% UI, 160,000-760,000) cases of chronic pelvic pain, 300,000 (95% UI, 104,000-570,000) cases of tubal factor infertility, and 140,000 (95% UI, 47,000-260,000) cases of ectopic pregnancy in women. We estimated that chlamydia screening and PN cost $9700 per QALY gained compared with no screening and no PN. We estimated the full realization of chlamydia screening guidelines for 2016 to 2019 to cost $30,000 per QALY gained, compared with a scenario in which chlamydia screening coverage was maintained at 2015 levels.","1297":" HAI titers. RNA sequencing of PBMCs from Days 0, 3 and 7 was measured in 28 participants and compared using pathway analyses. Frailty was not significantly associated with any HAI outcome in multivariable models. Compared with non-frail participants, frail participants expressed decreased cell proliferation, metabolism, antibody production, and interferon signaling genes. Conversely, frail participants showed elevated gene expression in IL-8 signaling, T-cell exhaustion, and oxidative stress pathways compared with non-frail participants. These results suggest that reduced effectiveness of influenza vaccine among older, frail individuals may be attributed to immunosenescence-related changes in PBMCs that are not reflected in antibody levels.","1298":"Although movement ecology has leveraged models of home range formation to explore the effects of spatial heterogeneity and social cues on movement behavior, disease ecology has yet to integrate these potential drivers and mechanisms of contact behavior into a generalizable disease modeling framework. Here we ask how dynamic territory formation and maintenance might contribute to disease dynamics in a territorial, solitary predator for an indirectly transmitted pathogen. We developed a mechanistic individual-based model where stigmergy-the deposition of signals into the environment (e.g., scent marking, scraping)-dictates local movement choices and long-term territory formation, but also the risk of pathogen transmission. Based on a variable importance analysis, the length of the infectious period was the single most important variable in predicting outbreak success, maximum prevalence, and outbreak duration. Host density and rate of pathogen decay were also key predictors. We found that territoriality best reduced maximum prevalence in conditions where we would otherwise expect outbreaks to be most successful: slower recovery rates (i.e., longer infectious periods) and higher conspecific densities. However, for slower pathogen decay rates, stigmergy-driven movement increased outbreak durations relative to random movement simulations. Our findings therefore support a limited version of the \"territoriality benefits\" hypothesis-where reduced home range overlap leads to reduced opportunities for pathogen transmission, but with the caveat that reduction in outbreak severity may increase the likelihood of pathogen persistence. For longer infectious periods and higher host densities, key trade-offs emerged between the strength of pathogen load, the strength of the stigmergy cue, and the rate at which those two quantities decayed; this finding raises interesting questions about the evolutionary nature of these competing processes and the role of possible feedbacks between parasitism and territoriality. This work also highlights the importance of considering social cues as part of the movement landscape in order to better understand the consequences of individual behaviors on population level outcomes.","1299":"The desire to predict discoveries-to have some idea, in advance, of what will be discovered, by whom, when, and where-pervades nearly all aspects of modern science, from individual scientists to publishers, from funding agencies to hiring committees. In this Essay, we survey the emerging and interdisciplinary field of the \"science of science\" and what it teaches us about the predictability of scientific discovery. We then discuss future opportunities for improving predictions derived from the science of science and its potential impact, positive and negative, on the scientific community.","1300":"Epidemiology, the aspect of research focusing on disease modelling is date intensive. Research epidemiologists in different research groups played a key role in developing different data driven model for COVID-19 and monkeypox. The requirement of accessing highly accurate data useful for disease modelling is beneficial but not without having challenges. Currently, the task of data acquisition is executed by select individuals in different research groups. This approach experiences the drawbacks associated with getting permission to access the desired data and inflexibility to change data acquisition goals due to dynamic epidemiological research objectives. The presented research addresses these challenges and proposes the design and use of dynamic intelligent crawlers for acquiring epidemiological data related to a given goal. In addition, the research aims to quantify how the use of computing entities enhances the process of data acquisition in epidemiological related studies. This is done by formulating and investigating the metrics of the data acquisition efficiency and the data analytics efficiency. The use of human assisted crawlers in the global information networks is found to enhance data acquisition efficiency (DAqE) and data analytics efficiency (DAnE). The use of human assisted crawlers in a hybrid configuration outperforms the case where manual research group member efforts are expended enhancing the DAqE and DAnE by up to 35% and 99% on average, respectively.","1301":"United States influenza virologic, hospitalization, and mortality surveillance data during 2000-2017 were analyzed for cohorts born between 1918 and 1989 that likely had different initial influenza virus exposures based on viruses circulating during early childhood. Relative risk\/rate during H3 compared with H1 predominant seasons during prepandemic versus pandemic and later periods were calculated for each cohort.The evolution of influenza A viruses results in birth cohorts that have different initial influenza virus exposures. Historically, A\/H3 predominant seasons have been associated with more severe influenza-associated disease; however, since the 2009 pandemic, there are suggestions that some birth cohorts experience more severe illness in A\/H1 predominant seasons.During the prepandemic period, all cohorts had more influenza-associated disease during H3 predominant seasons than H1 predominant seasons. During the pandemic and later period, 4 cohorts had higher hospitalization and mortality rates during H1 predominant seasons than H3 predominant seasons.Birth cohort differences in risk of influenza-associated disease by influenza A virus subtype can be seen in US influenza surveillance data and differ between prepandemic and pandemic and later periods. As the population ages, the amount of influenza-associated disease may be greater in future H1 predominant seasons than H3 predominant seasons.","1302":"Logistic regression is a statistical tool of paramount significance in the field of epidemiology1 and ranks as one of the most frequently published multivariable analyses for designs involving a single binary dependent variable and one or more independent variables in the fields of public health2,3 and medical4 research.","1303":"While the unmet healthcare needs are still being improved upon, the wellbeing of cancer patients has increasingly become a prime concern in Malaysia. The objective of this study is to ascertain the trend of unmet supportive care needs, post-traumatic growth (P T G), coping strategies, and social supports among patients with breast cancer over the three time points of treatment: T1 at early diagnosis, T2 for three months after diagnosis, and T3 for six months after diagnosis.A total of 240 cancer patients participated in this prospective cohort study, with follow-up visits from October 2019 until July 2021. Data were collected using several instruments: Brief COP E, the Source of Social Support Scale (SSSS), the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory - Short Form (P T GI-SF), and a Malay version of the 34-Item Shortform Supportive Care Need Survey (SCNS-SF34).The results indicated a significant change from T1 to T3 for all domains of the unmet needs (p-value < 0.001), except for the sexual domain. A lower SCNS-SF34 score resulted from more unfavorable social support. The P T GI-SF results indicated a trend toward meeting the unmet needs, and a higher SCNS-SF-34 score predicted a considerably higher P T GI-SF score.Our study findings suggest that majority of the factors evaluated in terms of unmet needs among cancer patients have undergone considerable changes.","1304":"induced leishmaniasis.","1305":"Countries around the world have implemented a series of interventions to contain the pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and significant lessons can be drawn from the study of the full transmission dynamics of the disease caused by-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-in the Eastern, Madinah, Makkah, and Riyadh regions of Saudi Arabia, where robust non-pharmaceutical interventions effectively suppressed the local outbreak of this disease. On the basis of 333732 laboratory-confirmed cases, we used mathematical modelling to reconstruct the complete spectrum dynamics of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia between 2 March and 25 September 2020 over 5 periods characterised by events and interventions. Our model account for asymptomatic and presymptomatic infectiousness, time-varying ascertainable infection rate, and transmission rates. Our results indicate that non-pharmaceutical interventions were effective in containing the epidemic, with reproduction numbers decreasing on average to 0.29 (0.19-0.66) in the Eastern, Madinah, Makkah, and Riyadh region. The chance of resurgence after the lifting of all interventions after 30 consecutive days with no symptomatic cases is also examined and emphasizes the danger presented by largely hidden infections while switching control strategies. These findings have major significance for evaluating methods for maintaining monitoring and interventions to eventually reduce outbreaks of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia in the future.","1306":"We show that information from Internet-based data sources, when combined using an informed, robust methodology, can be effectively used as early indicators of influenza activity at fine geographic resolutions.Influenza outbreaks pose major challenges to public health around the world, leading to thousands of deaths a year in the United States alone. Accurate systems that track influenza activity at the city level are necessary to provide actionable information that can be used for clinical, hospital, and community outbreak preparation.We first tested the ability of Google searches, Twitter posts, electronic health records, and a crowd-sourced influenza reporting system to detect influenza activity in the Boston metropolis separately. We then adapted a multivariate dynamic regression method named ARGO (autoregression with general online information), designed for tracking influenza at the national level, and showed that it effectively uses the above data sources to monitor and forecast influenza at the city level 1 week ahead of the current date. Finally, we presented an ensemble-based approach capable of combining information from models based on multiple data sources to more robustly nowcast as well as forecast influenza activity in the Boston metropolitan area. The performances of our models were evaluated in an out-of-sample fashion over 4 influenza seasons within 2012-2016, as well as a holdout validation period from 2016 to 2017.Although Internet-based real-time data sources such as Google searches and tweets have been successfully used to produce influenza activity estimates ahead of traditional health care-based systems at national and state levels, influenza tracking and forecasting at finer spatial resolutions, such as the city level, remain an open question. Our study aimed to present a precise, near real-time methodology capable of producing influenza estimates ahead of those collected and published by the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) for the Boston metropolitan area. This approach has great potential to be extended to other cities with access to similar data sources.Our ensemble-based methods incorporating information from diverse models based on multiple data sources, including ARGO, produced the most robust and accurate results. The observed Pearson correlations between our out-of-sample flu activity estimates and those historically reported by the BPHC were 0.98 in nowcasting influenza and 0.94 in forecasting influenza 1 week ahead of the current date.","1307":"Understanding human mixing patterns is the key to provide public health decision makers with model-based evaluation of strategies for the control of infectious diseases. Here we conducted a population-based survey in Tomsk, Russia, asking participants to record all their contacts in physical person during the day. We estimated 9.8 contacts per person per day on average, 15.2 when including additional estimated professional contacts. We found that contacts were highly assortative by age, especially for school-age individuals, and the number of contacts negatively correlated with the age of the participant. The network of contacts was quite clustered, with the majority of contacts (about 72%) occurring between family members, students of the same school\/university, and work colleagues. School represents the location where the largest number of contacts was recorded - students contacted about 7 individuals per day at school. Our modeling analysis based on the recorded contact patterns supports the importance of modeling age-mixing patterns - we show that, in the case of an epidemic caused by a novel influenza virus, school-age individuals would be the most affected age group, followed by adults aged 35-44 years. In conclusion, this study reveals an age-mixing pattern in general agreement with that estimated for European countries, although with several quantitative differences. The observed differences can be attributable to sociodemographic and cultural differences between countries. The age- and setting-specific contact matrices provided in this study could be instrumental for the design of control measures for airborne infections, specifically targeted on the characteristics of the Russian population.","1308":"We propose a simple two-disease epidemic model where one disease exhibits only a drug-sensitive strain, while the other exhibits both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains. Treatment for the first disease may select for resistance in the other. We model antibiotic use as a mathematical game through the study of individual incentives and community welfare. The basic reproduction number is derived and the existence and local stability of the model equilibria are analyzed. When the force of infection of each disease is unaffected by the presence of the other, we find that there is a conflict of interest between individual and community, known as a tragedy of the commons, under targeted treatment toward persons infected by the single strain disease, but there is no conflict under mass treatment. However, we numerically show that individual and social incentive to use antibiotics may show disaccord under mass treatment if the restriction on the transmission ability of the dually infected people is removed, or drug resistant infection is worse than drug sensitive infection, or the uninfected state has a comparative disutility over the infected states. ","1309":"Mounting evidence suggests the primary mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is aerosolized transmission from close contact with infected individuals. While transmission is a direct result of human encounters, falling humidity may enhance aerosolized transmission risks similar to other respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza). Using Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, we assessed the relative effects of absolute humidity and changes in individual movement patterns on daily cases while accounting for regional differences in climatological regimes. Our results indicate that increasing humidity was associated with declining cases in the spring and summer of 2020, while decreasing humidity and increase in residential mobility during winter months likely caused increases in COVID-19 cases. The effects of humidity were generally greater in regions with lower humidity levels. Given the possibility that COVID-19 will be endemic, understanding the behavioral and environmental drivers of COVID-19 seasonality in the United States will be paramount as policymakers, healthcare systems, and researchers forecast and plan accordingly.","1310":"TACT2 enrolled 1,000 participants with diabetes and prior myocardial infarction, age 50 years or older between September 2016 and December 2020. Among 959 participants with at least one infusion, 933 had blood and\/or urine metals measured at the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention using the same methodology as in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We compared metal levels in TACT2 to a contemporaneous subset of NHANES participants with CVD, diabetes and other inclusion criteria similar to TACT2's participants.At baseline, the median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 67 (60, 72) years, 27% were women, 78% reported white race, mean (SD) BMI was 32.7 (6.6) kg\/m2, 4% reported type 1 diabetes, 46.8% were treated with insulin, 22.3% with GLP1-receptor agonists or SGLT-2 inhibitors, 90.2% with aspirin, warfarin or P2Y12 inhibitors, and 86.5% with statins. Blood lead was detectable in all participants; median (IQR) was 9.19 (6.30, 13.9) \u03bcg\/L. Blood and urine cadmium were detectable in 97% and median (IQR) levels were 0.28 (0.18, 0.43) \u03bcg\/L and 0.30 (0.18, 0.51) \u03bcg\/g creatinine, respectively. Metal levels were largely similar to those in the contemporaneous NHANES subset.TACT2 participants were characterized by high use of medication to treat CVD and diabetes and similar baseline metal levels as in the general US population.

Data describing the epidemiology and ecology of IAVs among wildlife in the arctic are less frequently published compared to southern temperate regions, where prevalence and subtype diversity are more routinely documented. Following PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review addresses this gap by describing the prevalence, spatiotemporal distribution, and ecological characteristics of IAVs detected among wildlife and the environment in this understudied region of the globe. The literature search was performed in PubMed and Google Scholar using a set of pre-defined search terms to identify publications reporting on IAVs in Arctic regions between 1978 and February 2022. A total of 2125 articles were initially screened, 267 were assessed for eligibility, and 71 articles met inclusion criteria. IAVs have been detected in multiple wildlife species in all Arctic regions, including seabirds, shorebirds, waterfowl, seals, sea lions, whales, and terrestrial mammals, and in the environment. Isolates from wild birds comprise the majority of documented viruses derived from wildlife; however, among all animals and environmental matrices, 26 unique low and highly pathogenic subtypes have been characterized in the scientific literature from Arctic regions. Pooled prevalence across studies indicates 4.23% for wild birds, 3.42% among tested environmental matrices, and seroprevalences of 9.29% and 1.69% among marine and terrestrial mammals, respectively. Surveillance data are geographically biased, with most data from the Alaskan Arctic and many fewer reports from the Russian, Canadian, North Atlantic, and Western European Arctic. We highlight multiple important aspects of wildlife host, pathogen, and environmental ecology of IAVs in Arctic regions, including the role of avian migration and breeding cycles for the global spread of IAVs, evidence of inter-species and inter-continental reassortment at high latitudes, and how climate change-driven ecosystem shifts, including changes in the seasonal availability and distribution of dietary resources, have the potential to alter host-pathogen-environment dynamics in Arctic regions. We conclude by identifying gaps in knowledge and propose priorities for future research.","1312":".

This work presents the first systematic study to understand the dynamics of adoption of CIM knee implants and instrumentation. More broadly, the current modeling approach and systems thinking perspective could be used to consider the adoption of any emerging customized therapies for personalized medicine.A system dynamics simulation model was developed to study adoption dynamics of CIM and meet the research objectives. The model reproduced the historical data on primary and revision knee replacement implants obtained from the literature and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Then the dynamics of adoption of CIM implants were simulated from 2018 to 2026. The rate of 90-day readmission, 3-year revision surgery, recovery period, time savings in operating rooms, and the associated cost within 3 years of primary knee replacement implants were used as performance metrics.The simulation results indicate that by 2026, an adoption rate of 90% for CIM implants can reduce the number of readmissions and revision surgeries by 62% and 39%, respectively, and can save hospitals and surgeons 6% on procedure time and cut down cumulative healthcare costs by approximately $38 billion.","1314":"Bacterial viruses, that is 'bacteriophage' or 'phage', can infect and lyse their bacterial hosts, releasing new viral progeny. In addition to the lytic pathway, certain bacteriophage (i.e. 'temperate' bacteriophage) can also initiate lysogeny, a latent mode of infection in which the viral genome is integrated into and replicated with the bacterial chromosome. Subsequently, the integrated viral genome, that is the 'prophage', can induce and restart the lytic pathway. Here, we explore the relationship among infection mode, ecological context, and viral fitness, in essence asking: when should viruses be temperate? To do so, we use network loop analysis to quantify fitness in terms of network paths through the life history of an infectious pathogen that start and end with infected cells. This analysis reveals that temperate strategies, particularly those with direct benefits to cellular fitness, should be favored at low host abundances. This finding applies to a spectrum of mechanistic models of phage-bacteria dynamics spanning both explicit and implicit representations of intra-cellular infection dynamics. However, the same analysis reveals that temperate strategies, in and of themselves, do not provide an advantage when infection imposes a cost to cellular fitness. Hence, we use evolutionary invasion analysis to explore when temperate phage can invade microbial communities with circulating lytic phage. We find that lytic phage can drive down niche competition amongst microbial cells, facilitating the subsequent invasion of latent strategies that increase cellular resistance and\/or immunity to infection by lytic viruses-notably this finding holds even when the prophage comes at a direct fitness cost to cellular reproduction. Altogether, our analysis identifies broad ecological conditions that favor latency and provide a principled framework for exploring the impacts of ecological context on both the short- and long-term benefits of being temperate.","1315":"These models are important both to reduce uncertainty in evaluating MMR experiments and also to help planning future MRR studies.Experiments involving mosquito mark-release-recapture (MRR) design are helpful to determine abundance, survival and even recruitment of mosquito populations in the field. Obstacles in mosquito MRR protocols include marking limitations due to small individual size, short lifespan, low efficiency in capturing devices such as traps, and individual removal upon capture. These limitations usually make MRR analysis restricted to only abundance estimation or a combination of abundance and survivorship, and often generate a great degree of uncertainty about the estimations.We present a set of Bayesian biodemographic models designed to fit data from most common mosquito recapture experiments. Using both field data and simulations, we consider model features such as capture efficiency, survival rates, removal of individuals due to capturing, and collection of pupae. These models permit estimation of abundance, survivorship of both marked and unmarked mosquitoes, if different, and recruitment rate. We analyze the accuracy of estimates by varying the number of released individuals, abundance, survivorship, and capture efficiency in multiple simulations. These methods can stand capture efficiencies as low as usually reported but their accuracy depends on the number of released mosquitoes, abundance and survivorship. We also show that gathering pupal counts allows estimating differences in survivorship between released mosquitoes and the unmarked population.","1316":"Serious concerns about the way research is organized collectively are increasingly being raised. They include the escalating costs of research and lower research productivity, low public trust in researchers to report the truth, lack of diversity, poor community engagement, ethical concerns over research practices, and irreproducibility. Open science (OS) collaborations comprise of a set of practices including open access publication, open data sharing and the absence of restrictive intellectual property rights with which institutions, firms, governments and communities are experimenting in order to overcome these concerns. We gathered two groups of international representatives from a large variety of stakeholders to construct a toolkit to guide and facilitate data collection about OS and non-OS collaborations. Ultimately, the toolkit will be used to assess and study the impact of OS collaborations on research and innovation. The toolkit contains the following four elements: 1) an annual report form of quantitative data to be completed by OS partnership administrators; 2) a series of semi-structured interview guides of stakeholders; 3) a survey form of participants in OS collaborations; and 4) a set of other quantitative measures best collected by other organizations, such as research foundations and governmental or intergovernmental agencies. We opened our toolkit to community comment and input. We present the resulting toolkit for use by government and philanthropic grantors, institutions, researchers and community organizations with the aim of measuring the implementation and impact of OS partnership across these organizations. We invite these and other stakeholders to not only measure, but to share the resulting data so that social scientists and policy makers can analyse the data across projects.","1317":"Identifying hotspots of tuberculosis transmission can inform spatially targeted active case-finding interventions. While national tuberculosis programs maintain notification registers which represent a potential source of data to investigate transmission patterns, high local tuberculosis incidence may not provide a reliable signal for transmission because the population distribution of covariates affecting susceptibility and disease progression may confound the relationship between tuberculosis incidence and transmission. Child cases of tuberculosis and other endemic infectious disease have been observed to provide a signal of their transmission intensity. We assessed whether local overrepresentation of child cases in tuberculosis notification data corresponds to areas where recent transmission events are concentrated.Age-disaggregated notification data can be used to identify hotspots of tuberculosis transmission and suggest local force of infection, providing an easily accessible source of data to target active case-finding intervention.Areas in which childhood tuberculosis cases are overrepresented align with areas of spatial concentration of transmission revealed by molecular epidemiologic methods.We visualized spatial clustering of children <\u20095\u2009years old notified to Peru's National Tuberculosis Program from two districts of Lima, Peru, from 2005 to 2007 using a log-Gaussian Cox process to model the intensity of the point-referenced child cases. To identify where clustering of child cases was more extreme than expected by chance alone, we mapped all cases from the notification data onto a grid and used a hierarchical Bayesian spatial model to identify grid cells where the proportion of cases among children <\u20095\u2009years old is greater than expected. Modeling the proportion of child cases allowed us to use the spatial distribution of adult cases to control for unobserved factors that may explain the spatial variability in the distribution of child cases. We compare where young children are overrepresented in case notification data to areas identified as transmission hotspots using molecular epidemiological methods during a prospective study of tuberculosis transmission conducted from 2009 to 2012 in the same setting.","1318":"Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is increasingly used to aid the understanding of pathogen transmission. A first step in analyzing WGS data is usually to define \"transmission clusters,\" sets of cases that are potentially linked by direct transmission. This is often done by including two cases in the same cluster if they are separated by fewer single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) than a specified threshold. However, there is little agreement as to what an appropriate threshold should be. We propose a probabilistic alternative, suggesting that the key inferential target for transmission clusters is the number of transmissions separating cases. We characterize this by combining the number of SNP differences and the length of time over which those differences have accumulated, using information about case timing, molecular clock, and transmission processes. Our framework has the advantage of allowing for variable mutation rates across the genome and can incorporate other epidemiological data. We use two tuberculosis studies to illustrate the impact of our approach: with British Columbia data by using spatial divisions; with Republic of Moldova data by incorporating antibiotic resistance. Simulation results indicate that our transmission-based method is better in identifying direct transmissions than a SNP threshold, with dissimilarity between clusterings of on average 0.27\u2009bits compared with 0.37\u2009bits for the SNP-threshold method and 0.84\u2009bits for randomly permuted data. These results show that it is likely to outperform the SNP-threshold method where clock rates are variable and sample collection times are spread out. We implement the method in the R package transcluster.","1319":"We present m6ACali, a novel machine-learning framework aimed at enhancing the accuracy of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) epitranscriptome profiling by reducing the impact of non-specific antibody enrichment in MeRIP-Seq. The calibration model serves as a genomic feature-based classifier that refines the identification of m6A sites, distinguishing those genuinely present from those that can be detected in in-vitro transcribed (IVT) control experiments. We find that m6ACali effectively identifies non-specific binding peaks reported by exomePeak2 and MACS2 in novel MeRIP-Seq datasets without the need for paired IVT controls. The model interpretation revealed that off-target antibody binding sites commonly occur at short exons and short mRNAs, originating from high read coverage regions that share the motif sequence with true m6A sites. We also reveal that the ML strategy can efficiently adjust differentially methylated peaks and other antibody-dependent, base-resolution m6A detection techniques. As a result, m6ACali offers a promising method for the universal enhancement of m6A profiles generated by MeRIP-Seq experiments, elevating the benchmark for omics-level m6A data integration.","1320":"The CYD-TDV vaccine was recently developed to combat dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease that afflicts millions of people each year throughout the tropical and subtropical world. Its rollout has been complicated by recent findings that vaccinees with no prior exposure to dengue virus (DENV) experience an elevated risk of severe disease in response to their first DENV infection subsequent to vaccination. As a result of these findings, guidelines for use of CYD-TDV now require serological screening prior to vaccination to establish that an individual does not fall into this high-risk category. These complications mean that the public health impact of CYD-TDV vaccination is expected to be higher in areas with higher transmission. One important practical difficulty with tailoring vaccination policy to local transmission contexts is that DENV transmission is spatially heterogeneous, even at the scale of neighborhoods or blocks within a city. This raises the question of whether models based on data that average over spatial heterogeneity in transmission could fail to capture important aspects of CYD-TDV impact in spatially heterogeneous populations. We explored this question with a deterministic model of DENV transmission and CYD-TDV vaccination in a population comprised of two communities with differing transmission intensities. Compared to the full model, a version of the model based on the average of the two communities failed to capture benefits of targeting the intervention to the high-transmission community, which resulted in greater impact in both communities than we observed under even coverage. In addition, the model based on the average of the two communities substantially overestimated impact among vaccinated individuals in the low-transmission community. In the event that the specificity of serological screening is not high, this result suggests that models that ignore spatial heterogeneity could overlook the potential for harm to this segment of the population.","1321":"We aimed to: (1) externally validate the five-item Hypoglycaemia Awareness Questionnaire (HypoA-Q) impaired awareness subscale (HypoA-Q IA); (2) examine how impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia (IAH) relates to the risk of severe hypoglycaemia and level 2 hypoglycaemia; and (3) identify factors associated with IAH.Nationwide survey of T1D Exchange registrants was conducted to collect data on demographics, 6 month severe-hypoglycaemia history, hypoglycaemia awareness status (via HypoA-Q IA, the Gold instrument and the Clarke instrument) and continuous glucose monitor (CGM) measures. The Clarke hypoglycaemia awareness factor (Clarke-HAF) was calculated to exclude severe-hypoglycaemia history items. Analyses included Cronbach's \u03b1, Spearman correlations and logistic regression.The HypoA-Q IA is a brief, valid and reliable tool for assessing IAH in today's technology-oriented era. IAH was independently associated with severe hypoglycaemia and level 2 hypoglycaemia in a cohort with high prevalence of advanced diabetes technology use and HbA1c within the recommended range. CGM and HCL use was related to lower IAH risk.Valid survey responses were collected from N=1580 adults with type 1 diabetes (median age, 44 years; 52% female participants; median HbA1c, 48 mmol\/mol [6.5%]). Of these, 94% of participants were using CGMs and 69% were using hybrid closed-loop (HCL) systems; 30% had at least one severe-hypoglycaemia episode in the past 6 months. The HypoA-Q IA had satisfactory internal reliability (\u03b1=0.79) and construct validity. Higher HypoA-Q IA scores were independently associated with greater risk of severe hypoglycaemia (p<0.001), performing comparably to the Gold instrument and the Clarke-HAF instrument. HypoA-Q IA-determined IAH was independently associated with 88% higher odds of developing severe hypoglycaemia (p<0.001) and twofold higher odds for spending \u22651% of time in level 2 hypoglycaemia (p=0.011). Higher age and longer diabetes duration were associated with higher IAH risk (p<0.001). CGM and HCL use was associated with lower IAH risk (p<0.001).","1322":"Bladder cancer is a cancerous disease that mainly affects elder men and women. The immunotherapy that uses Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin (BCG) effectively treats bladder cancer by stimulating the immune response of patients. The therapeutic performance of BCG relies on drug dosing, and the design of an optimal BCG regimen is an open question. In this study, we propose the reparameterized multiobjective control (RMC) approach for seeking an optimal drug dosing regimen and apply it to the design of BCG treatment. This approach utilizes constrained optimization based on a nonlinear bladder cancer model with impulsive drug instillation. We compare the performance of RMC with Koopman model predictive control (MPC) and validate the efficacy of optimal BCG dosing regimens through numerical simulations, demonstrating the efficient elimination of cancerous cells. The proposed control framework holds the potential for generalization to other model-based treatment designs.","1323":"We developed machine learning models that do not require physicians' subjective evaluation for FN mortality risk prediction.In this study, we leveraged machine learning techniques to build a FN mortality risk evaluation tool focused on FN admissions without physicians' subjective evaluation.Our analysis detected 126,013 adult admissions within the NIS data that were diagnosed with FN, among which 5,856 were declared as deceased (4.6 %). Our machine learning results demonstrate linear models and non-linear models achieved areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) around 92 % in survival prediction.We used the National Inpatient Sample and Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) that included mortality data among adult inpatients who were diagnosed with FN during a hospital admission. Machine learning techniques that we compared included linear models (ridge logistic regression and linear support vector machine) and non-linear models (gradient boosting tree and neural network). The primary outcome for this study was death among individuals with a recorded FN admission. Model comparison was evaluated based on areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and model performance was estimated using 30 % test set created via stratified split.Febrile neutropenia (FN) has been associated with high mortality among adults with cancer. Current systems for early detection of inpatient FN mortality are based on scoring indexes that require intensive physicians' subjective evaluation.","1324":"The epidemic threshold of the susceptible-infected-recovered model is a boundary separating parameters that permit epidemics from those that do not. This threshold corresponds to parameters where the system's equilibrium becomes unstable. Consequently, we use the average rate at which deviations from the equilibrium shrink to define a distance to this threshold. However, the vital dynamics of the host population may occur slowly even when transmission is far from threshold levels. Here, we show analytically how such slow dynamics can prevent estimation of the distance to the threshold from fluctuations in the susceptible population. Although these results are exact only in the limit of long-term observation of a large system, simulations show that they still provide useful insight into systems with a range of population sizes, environmental noise and observation schemes. Having established some guidelines about when estimates are accurate, we then illustrate how multiple distance estimates can be used to estimate the rate of approach to the threshold. The estimation approach is general and may be applicable to zoonotic pathogens such as Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) as well as vaccine-preventable diseases like measles.","1325":"Natal was the capital with the lowest vaccination coverage, below 75.0% for most immunizers. Teresina had rates equal to or greater than 90.0% for all vaccines.

This study evaluates the performance of commercial anti-DENV IgG tests to identify tests that could be used for pre-vaccination screening. First, for seven tests, we evaluated sensitivity and specificity in early convalescent dengue virus (DENV) infection, using 44 samples collected 7-30 days after symptom onset and confirmed by RT-PCR. Next, for the five best-performing tests and two additional tests (with and without an external test reader) that became available later, we evaluated performance to detect past dengue infection among a panel of 44 specimens collected in 2018-2019 from healthy 9- to 16-year-old children from Puerto Rico. Finally, a full-scale evaluation was done with the four best-performing tests using 400 specimens from the same population. We used virus focus reduction neutralization test and an in-house DENV IgG ELISA as reference standards. Of seven tests, five showed \u226575% sensitivity in detecting anti-DENV IgG in early convalescent specimens with low cross-reactivity to the Zika virus. For the detection of previous DENV infections, the tests with the highest performance were the Euroimmun NS1 IgG ELISA (sensitivity 84.5%, specificity 97.1%) and CTK Dengue IgG rapid test R0065C with the test reader (sensitivity 76.2% specificity 98.1%). There are IgG tests available that can be used to accurately classify individuals with previous DENV infection as eligible for dengue vaccination to support safe vaccine implementation.The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has set forth recommendations that dengue pre-vaccination screening tests must exhibit at least 98% specificity and 75% sensitivity. Our research rigorously assesses the performance of various commercial tests against these benchmarks using well-characterized specimens from Puerto Rico. The findings from our study are particularly relevant given FDA approval and ACIP recommendation of Sanofi Pasteur's Dengvaxia vaccine, highlighting the need for accurate pre-vaccination screening tools.","1327":"This analysis identified national and region-specific factors that affect ownership and use among those with access in Guinea. Future ITN and social-behavioural change campaigns in Guinea may particularly want to target larger households, households without children, and areas with lower perceived risk of malaria if universal coverage and usage are to be achieved for optimal malaria prevention.Malaria is a leading cause of outpatient visits and deaths among children in Guinea. Despite several mass distribution campaigns of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) in Guinea, ITN ownership and use remain low. Identifying the underlying factors affecting household ITN ownership and ITN usage among those with access will allow the Guinea National Malaria Control Programme to develop targeted initiatives to improve bed net ownership and usage.To understand national and regional drivers of ITN ownership and use, multivariable binary logistic regression models were applied to data from the 2018 Demographic and Health Survey to identify risk factors of household ITN ownership and risk factors of ITN use among individuals with access. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used for model parameter selection. Odds ratios were estimated with corresponding 95% confidence intervals.The proportion of households in Guinea with at least one ITN was 44%, ranging from a low of 25% in Conakry to a high of 54% in Lab\u00e9. Use of ITNs among those with access was 66.1% nationally, ranging from 35.2% in Lab\u00e9 to 89.7% in N'z\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9. Risk factors for household ITN ownership were household size, marital status of the household head, education level of the household head, and region. For ITN use among those with access, risk factors were age, wealth quintile, marital status, and region. In the seven regions of Guinea and capital of Conakry, risk factors for household ITN ownership were household size in Bok\u00e9, Faranah, and Kankan; education level of the household head in Bok\u00e9, Faranah, and N'z\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9; age of the household head in Conakry and Lab\u00e9; children under five in the household in Kankan; and wealth quintile in Mamou.

The positive sentiment network centered around parents and focused on communicating health risks and benefits, highlighting medical concepts such as measles, autism, HPV vaccine, vaccine-autism link, meningococcal disease, and MMR vaccine. In contrast, the negative network centered around children and focused on organizational bodies such as CDC, vaccine industry, doctors, mainstream media, pharmaceutical companies, and United States. The prevalence of negative vaccine sentiment was demonstrated through diverse messaging, framed around skepticism and distrust of government organizations that communicate scientific evidence supporting positive vaccine benefits.Vaccine hesitancy continues to contribute to suboptimal vaccination coverage in the United States, posing significant risk of disease outbreaks, yet remains poorly understood.We constructed semantic networks of vaccine information from internet articles shared by Twitter users in the United States. We analyzed resulting network topology, compared semantic differences, and identified the most salient concepts within networks expressing positive, negative, and neutral vaccine sentiment.Semantic network analysis of vaccine sentiment in online social media can enhance understanding of the scope and variability of current attitudes and beliefs toward vaccines. Our study synthesizes quantitative and qualitative evidence from an interdisciplinary approach to better understand complex drivers of vaccine hesitancy for public health communication, to improve vaccine confidence and vaccination coverage in the United States.","1329":"Bacillus anthracis, the bacteria that causes anthrax, a disease that primarily affects herbivorous animals, is a soil borne endospore-forming microbe. Environmental distribution of viable spores determines risky landscapes for herbivore exposure and subsequent anthrax outbreaks. Spore survival and longevity depends on suitable conditions in its environment. Anthrax is endemic in Queen Elizabeth Protected Area in western Uganda. Periodic historical outbreaks with significant wildlife losses date to 1950s, but B. anthracis ecological niche in the ecosystem is poorly understood. This study used the Maximum Entropy modeling algorithm method to predict suitable niche and environmental conditions that may support anthrax distribution and spore survival. Model inputs comprised 471 presence-only anthrax occurrence data from park management records of 1956-2010, and 11 predictor variables derived from the World Climatic and Africa Soil Grids online resources, selected considering the ecology of anthrax. The findings revealed predicted suitable niche favoring survival and distribution of anthrax spores as a narrow-restricted corridor within the study area, defined by hot-dry climatic conditions with alkaline soils rich in potassium and calcium. A mean test AUC of 0.94 and predicted probability of 0.93 for anthrax presence were registered. The five most important predictor variables that accounted for 93.8% of model variability were annual precipitation (70.1%), exchangeable potassium (12.6%), annual mean temperature (4.3%), soil pH (3.7%) and calcium (3.1%). The predicted suitable soil properties likely originate from existing sedimentary calcareous gypsum rocks. This has implications for long-term presence of B. anthracis spores and might explain the long history of anthrax experienced in the area. However, occurrence of suitable niche as a restricted hot zone offers opportunities for targeted anthrax surveillance, response and establishment of monitoring strategies in QEPA.","1330":"Given supply constraints of N95s in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare facilities have turned to extended use protocols and new sources of N95s.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective longitudinal study using the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health and the Spanish Ministry of Health surveillance data for February 2020-June 2021 to explore sex and age differences in COVID-19 cases and testing. The female-male incidence rate ratios (IRR) were estimated for each week of the pandemic. We complemented our analysis with qualitative information on relevant containment measures in each country. Results: In Switzerland and in Spain, there was an excess of cases in women of 20-59\u00a0years old and 80+. This excess of cases was significant during the waves of the pandemic in both countries. In Switzerland, the biggest difference was observed for the age group 20-29, reaching an excess of 94% of cases compared to men during the first wave of COVID-19 (March-May 2020). The excess of cases in women was greater in Spain than in Switzerland, where it reached 159% for women aged 20-29 during the first wave (March-June 2020). In both countries, the age groups 60-79 had a significant excess of cases in men during the pandemic. Conclusion: COVID-19 public health policies affect men and women in different ways. Our findings highlight the importance of gender-sensitive responses to address a public health crisis.","1333":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the real-world cost effectiveness of adjuvant stage III colon cancer chemotherapy regimens, given that previous analyses have been based on data from clinical trials. The study was designed using integrated decision tree and Markov model, which was developed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of 5-fluorouracil\/leucovorin (5-FU\/LV), capecitabine, and the combination of each with oxaliplatin. The analysis was performed from a US Veterans Affairs perspective via retrospectively collected data, over a 5-year model time horizon. Outcome and cost data were used to calculate cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY), and one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. In the base case analysis, capecitabine and capecitabine plus oxaliplatin both cost more and were less effective than other regimens, and 5-FU\/LV plus oxaliplatin, compared to 5-FU\/LV alone, resulted in a cost of $25,997 per QALY gained. Model results were generally robust to parameter variation. Capecitabine plus oxaliplatin could be economically reasonable if full dosing occurred \u226576% of the time (base case 42%). In a real-world setting, the addition of oxaliplatin to 5-FU\/LV is more effective but also more costly than 5-FU\/LV alone. If full dosing of capecitabine-containing regimens can be assured, they may also be cost-effective strategies. ","1334":"This tutorial aims to help make the best available methods for generating and presenting cost-effectiveness results with uncertainty common practice. We believe there is a need for such type of tutorial because some erroneous practices persist (e.g., identifying the cost-effective intervention as the one with the highest probability to be cost-effective), while some of the more advanced methods are hardly used (e.g., the net loss statistic 'NL', expected net loss curves and frontier). The tutorial explains with simple examples the pros and cons of using ICER, incremental net benefit and NL to identify the cost-effective intervention, both with and without uncertainty accounted for probabilistically. A flowchart provides practical guidance on when and how to use ICER, incremental net benefit or NL. Different ways to express and present uncertainty in the results are described, including confidence and credible intervals, the probability that a strategy is cost-effective (as usually shown with cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs)) and the expected value of perfect information (EVPI). The tutorial clarifies and illustrates why EVPI is the only measure accounting fully for decision uncertainty, and why NL curves and the NL frontier may be preferred over CEACs and other plots for presenting cost-effectiveness results in the context of uncertainty. The easy calculations and a worked-out real-life example will help users to thoroughly understand and correctly interpret key cost-effectiveness results.

We first introduce a suitable geometric description of the set of fixed rank matrices which relies on a natural parametrization of matrices. More precisely, it is endowed with the structure of analytic principal bundle, with an explicit description of local charts. For matrix differential equations, we introduce a first order numerical integrator working in local coordinates. The resulting chart based algorithm can be interpreted as a particular splitting of the projection operator onto the tangent space of the low-rank matrix manifold. It is proven to be robust and exact in some particular case. Numerical experiments confirm these results and illustrate the behavior of the proposed algorithm.","1336":"As the name of the genus Pantoea (\"of all sorts and sources\") suggests, this genus includes bacteria with a wide range of provenances, including plants, animals, soils, components of the water cycle, and humans. Some members of the genus are pathogenic to plants, and some are suspected to be opportunistic human pathogens; while others are used as microbial pesticides or show promise in biotechnological applications. During its taxonomic history, the genus and its species have seen many revisions. However, evolutionary and comparative genomics studies have started to provide a solid foundation for a more stable taxonomy. To move further toward this goal, we have built a 2,509-gene core genome tree of 437 public genome sequences representing the currently known diversity of the genus Pantoea. Clades were evaluated for being evolutionarily and ecologically significant by determining bootstrap support, gene content differences, and recent recombination events. These results were then integrated with genome metadata, published literature, descriptions of named species with standing in nomenclature, and circumscriptions of yet-unnamed species clusters, 15 of which we assigned names under the nascent SeqCode. Finally, genome-based circumscriptions and descriptions of each species and each significant genetic lineage within species were uploaded to the LINbase Web server so that newly sequenced genomes of isolates belonging to any of these groups could be precisely and accurately identified.","1337":" R package. Nationally, we estimated there had been 49 million symptomatic COVID-19 cases and 400,718 COVID-19 deaths by the end of 2020, and that 27% of the US population had been infected. The results also demonstrate wide county-level variability in the timing and magnitude of incidence, with local epidemiological trends differing substantially from state or regional averages, leading to large differences in the estimated proportion of the population infected by the end of 2020. Our estimates of true COVID-19 related deaths are consistent with independent estimates of excess mortality, and our estimated trends in cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection are consistent with trends in seroprevalence estimates from available antibody testing studies. Reconstructing the underlying incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections across US counties allows for a more granular understanding of disease trends and the potential impact of epidemiological drivers.","1338":"The U.S. Ryan White HIV\/AIDS Program (RWHAP) funds comprehensive services for people living with HIV to support viral suppression (VS). We analyzed five years of RWHAP data from the Minneapolis-St. Paul region to (1) assess variation and (2) evaluate the causal effect of each RWHAP service on sustained VS by race\/ethnicity. Sixteen medical and support services were included. Descriptive analyses assessed service use and trends over time. Causal analyses used generalized estimating equations and propensity scores to adjust for the probability of service use. Receipt of AIDS Drug Assistance Program and financial aid consistently showed higher probabilities of sustained VS, while food aid and transportation aid had positive impacts on VS at higher levels of service encounters; however, the impact of services could vary by race\/ethnicity. For example, financial aid increased the probability of sustained VS by at least 3 percentage points for white, Hispanic and Black\/African American clients, but only 1.6 points for Black\/African-born clients. This study found that services addressing socioeconomic needs typically had positive impacts on viral suppression, yet service use and impact of services often varied by race\/ethnicity. This highlights a need to ensure these services are designed and delivered in ways that equitably serve all clients.","1339":"Assessing and managing the impact of large-scale epidemics considering only the individual risk and severity of the disease is exceedingly difficult and could be extremely expensive. Economic consequences, infrastructure and service disruption, as well as the recovery speed, are just a few of the many dimensions along which to quantify the effect of an epidemic on society's fabric. Here, we extend the concept of resilience to characterize epidemics in structured populations, by defining the system-wide critical functionality that combines an individual's risk of getting the disease (disease attack rate) and the disruption to the system's functionality (human mobility deterioration). By studying both conceptual and data-driven models, we show that the integrated consideration of individual risks and societal disruptions under resilience assessment framework provides an insightful picture of how an epidemic might impact society. In particular, containment interventions intended for a straightforward reduction of the risk may have net negative impact on the system by slowing down the recovery of basic societal functions. The presented study operationalizes the resilience framework, providing a more nuanced and comprehensive approach for optimizing containment schemes and mitigation policies in the case of epidemic outbreaks.","1340":" and CO from biomass burning into nearby homes in a low-income urban area of Dhaka, Bangladesh. and CO concentrations. or CO is greatest in homes that share a wall with the biomass-burning home.

We quantify the direct health impacts of weather on COVID-19 hospitalizations and the indirect effects of weather via time spent indoors away-from-home on COVID-19 hospitalizations within five Colorado counties between March 4th 2020 and January 31st 2021.We found evidence that changes in 12-day lagged hospital admissions were primarily via the direct effects of weather conditions, rather than via indirect effects by which weather changes time spent indoors away-from-home. Sensitivity analyses evaluating time at home as a mediator were consistent with these conclusions.We aim to evaluate the extent to which weather impacts COVID-19 via time spent away-from-home in indoor spaces, as compared to a direct effect of weather on COVID-19 hospitalization, independent of mobility.Our findings do not support the hypothesis that weather impacted SARS-CoV-2 transmission via changes in mobility patterns during the first year of the pandemic. Rather, weather appears to have impacted SARS-CoV-2 transmission primarily via mechanisms other than human movement. We recommend further analysis of this phenomenon to determine whether these findings generalize to current SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and other seasonal respiratory pathogens.There is growing evidence that weather alters SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but it remains unclear what drives the phenomenon. One prevailing hypothesis is that people spend more time indoors in cooler weather, leading to increased spread of SARS-CoV-2 related to time spent in confined spaces and close contact with others. However, the evidence in support of that hypothesis is limited and, at times, conflicting.","1342":"To stop tuberculosis (TB), the leading infectious cause of death globally, we need to better understand transmission risk factors. Although many studies have identified associations between individual-level covariates and pathogen genetic relatedness, few have identified characteristics of transmission pairs or explored how closely covariates associated with genetic relatedness mirror those associated with transmission.We simulated a TB-like outbreak with pathogen genetic data and estimated odds ratios (ORs) to correlate each covariate and genetic relatedness. We used a naive Bayes approach to modify the genetic links and nonlinks to resemble the true links and nonlinks more closely and estimated modified ORs with this approach. We compared these two sets of ORs with the true ORs for transmission. Finally, we applied this method to TB data in Hamburg, Germany, and Massachusetts, USA, to find pair-level covariates associated with transmission.We developed a method to improve the use of genetic relatedness as a proxy for transmission, and aid in understanding TB transmission dynamics in low-burden settings.Using simulations, we found that associations between covariates and genetic relatedness had the same relative magnitudes and directions as the true associations with transmission, but biased absolute magnitudes. Modifying the genetic links and nonlinks reduced the bias and increased the confidence interval widths, more accurately capturing error. In Hamburg and Massachusetts, pairs were more likely to be probable transmission links if they lived in closer proximity, had a shorter time between observations, or had shared ethnicity, social risk factors, drug resistance, or genotypes.","1343":"The original paper was published without unique DOIs for GBIF occurrence downloads.

NC community pharmacies infrequently offer HIV and HCV screening. Paired with disseminating the evidence of the positive impact of harm reduction on individual and public health outcomes to NC pharmacists, institutional and systems changes to practice and policy may be important to promote harm reduction service availability, particularly for rural NC residents.N\/A.Pharmacists are among the most accessible healthcare providers in the United States and uniquely positioned to provide harm reduction services. The availability of pharmacy-based harm reduction services and pharmacist attitudes toward delivering these services have been understudied to date. We examine North Carolina (NC) pharmacists' experiences with and attitudes about harm reduction services and explore differences between rural and urban pharmacists.Three hundred pharmacists responded to the survey; 68 (23%) practiced in rural counties. Dispensing non-prescription syringes and naloxone at least occasionally was reported by 77% (n\u2009=\u2009231) and 88% (n\u2009=\u2009263) pharmacists, respectively. Pharmacy-delivered HIV or HCV screening was rare. Urban pharmacists dispensed naloxone more frequently than rural pharmacies (p\u2009=\u20090.04). Only 52% of pharmacists agreed that persons who inject drugs should always be allowed to buy non-prescription syringes. Rural pharmacists' attitudes toward harm reduction services for persons who inject drugs were statistically, though marginally, less supportive when compared to urban pharmacists' attitudes. The most common barrier to non-prescription syringe access was requiring patients to provide proof of prescription injection medication use, which 21% of pharmacists reported was required by their pharmacy's policy on non-prescription syringe sales.A convenience sample of NC pharmacists participated in an anonymous, online survey regarding harm reduction services: non-prescription syringe sales; naloxone dispensing; and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening. Urban-rural differences were analyzed using Pearson's chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. Open-ended responses were analyzed thematically.","1345":"The 2022 multi-country monkeypox (mpox) outbreak concurrent with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the need for genomic surveillance and rapid pathogen whole genome sequencing. While metagenomic sequencing approaches have been used to sequence many of the early mpox infections, these methods are resource intensive and require samples with high viral DNA concentrations. Given the atypical clinical presentation of cases associated with the outbreak and uncertainty regarding viral load across both the course of infection and anatomical body sites, there was an urgent need for a more sensitive and broadly applicable sequencing approach. Highly multiplexed amplicon-based sequencing (PrimalSeq) was initially developed for sequencing of Zika virus, and later adapted as the main sequencing approach for SARS-CoV-2. Here, we used PrimalScheme to develop a primer scheme for human monkeypox virus that can be used with many sequencing and bioinformatics pipelines implemented in public health laboratories during the COVID-19 pandemic. We sequenced clinical samples that tested presumptive positive for human monkeypox virus with amplicon-based and metagenomic sequencing approaches. We found notably higher genome coverage across the virus genome, with minimal amplicon drop-outs, in using the amplicon-based sequencing approach, particularly in higher PCR cycle threshold (lower DNA titer) samples. Further testing demonstrated that Ct value correlated with the number of sequencing reads and influenced the percent genome coverage. To maximize genome coverage when resources are limited, we recommend selecting samples with a PCR cycle threshold below 31 Ct and generating 1 million sequencing reads per sample. To support national and international public health genomic surveillance efforts, we sent out primer pool aliquots to 10 laboratories across the United States, United Kingdom, Brazil, and Portugal. These public health laboratories successfully implemented the human monkeypox virus primer scheme in various amplicon sequencing workflows and with different sample types across a range of Ct values. Thus, we show that amplicon based sequencing can provide a rapidly deployable, cost-effective, and flexible approach to pathogen whole genome sequencing in response to newly emerging pathogens. Importantly, through the implementation of our primer scheme into existing SARS-CoV-2 workflows and across a range of sample types and sequencing platforms, we further demonstrate the potential of this approach for rapid outbreak response.","1346":"Interventions aimed at the enteric bacterial population ecology, such as diet changes, may be effective at reducing the prevalence of tetracycline-resistant enteric bacteria in beef cattle. Behavior pattern sensitivity analysis is a useful and flexible tool for conducting a sensitivity analysis on models with varied output behavior, enabling prioritization of input parameters via regression model selection techniques. Cox proportional hazard models are an alternative to linear regression when behavior pattern measures are censored or linear regression assumptions cannot be met.We have expanded the behavior pattern sensitivity analysis procedure by incorporating model selection techniques to produce parsimonious linear regression models that efficiently prioritize input parameters. We also demonstrate how to address common violations of linear regression model assumptions. Finally, we explore the semi-parametric Cox proportional hazards model as an alternative to linear regression for situations with censored data. In the example mathematical model, the resistant bacteria exhibited three behaviors during the simulation period: (1) increasing, (2) decreasing, and (3) increasing during antimicrobial therapy and decreasing after therapy ceases. The behavior pattern sensitivity analysis identified bacterial population parameters as high importance in determining the trajectory of the resistant bacteria population.Sensitivity analysis is an essential step in mathematical modeling because it identifies parameters with a strong influence on model output, due to natural variation or uncertainty in the parameter values. Recently behavior pattern sensitivity analysis has been suggested as a method for sensitivity analyses on models with more than one mode of output behavior. The model output is classified by behavior mode and several behavior pattern measures, defined by the researcher, are calculated for each behavior mode. Significant associations between model inputs and outputs are identified by building linear regression models with the model parameters as independent variables and the behavior pattern measures as the dependent variables. We applied the behavior pattern sensitivity analysis to a mathematical model of tetracycline-resistant enteric bacteria in beef cattle administered chlortetracycline orally. The model included 29 parameters related to bacterial population dynamics, chlortetracycline pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The prevalence of enteric resistance during and after chlortetracycline administration was the model output. Cox proportional hazard models were used when linear regression assumptions were not met.","1347":" glycoprotein genes by convergent evolution. In particular, structural analysis predicts that one of the changes in the Spike S1 subunit, which contains the receptor-binding domain, may affect protein's flexibility and binding to the host cell receptor. Our findings not only underscore the ability of deltacoronaviruses to adapt and potentially lead to human-to-human transmission, but also raise questions about the role of such transmissions in development of pre-existing immunity to other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2.","1348":"In the effort to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission, public health agencies in the United States and globally are aiming to increase population immunity. Immunity through vaccination and acquired following recovery from natural infection are the two means to building up population immunity, with vaccination representing the safe pathway. However, measuring the contribution to population immunity from vaccination or natural infection is non-trivial. Historical COVID-19 case counts and vaccine coverage are necessary information but are not sufficient to approximate population immunity. Here, we consider the nuances of measuring each and propose an analytical framework for integrating the necessary data on cumulative vaccinations and natural infections at the state and national level. To guide vaccine roll-out and other aspects of control over the coming months, we recommend analytics that combine vaccine coverage with local (e.g. county-level) history of case reports and adjustment for waning antibodies to establish local estimates of population immunity. To do so, the strategic use of minimally-biased serology surveys integrated with vaccine administration data can improve estimates of the aggregate level of immunity to guide data-driven decisions to re-open safely and prioritize vaccination efforts.","1349":"Background: An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has led to 46,997 confirmed cases as of 13th February 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Methods: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January and February 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. Findings: We estimated that the median daily reproduction number, Rt , declined from 2.35 (95% CI: 1.15-4.77) one week before travel restrictions were introduced on 23rd January to 1.05 (95% CI: 0.413-2.39) one week after. Based on our estimates of Rt,we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential as Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. Interpretation: Our results show that COVID-19 transmission likely declined in Wuhan during late January 2020, coinciding with the introduction of control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan pre-control, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but may still cause new outbreaks eventually. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust (grants 206250\/Z\/17\/Z and 210758\/Z\/18\/Z) and HDR UK (grant: MR\/S003975\/1). ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and\/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB\/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

We used a Cox proportional hazards model with time varying indicators for COVID-19 illness or vaccination in the previous 30 days.We found a significantly increased rate of new abnormal heart rhythms reported in the 30 days following COVID-19 illness. No additional cardiovascular events were reported after COVID-19 illness. 2.5% of respondents with COVID-19 illness were hospitalized. We did not find a statistically significant increased rate of cardiovascular events in the 30 days following any COVID-19 vaccination dose. Post COVID-19 vaccination, 87.2% of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome respondents endorsed an expected adverse event (EAE), and 3.1% reported an emergency department visit\/hospitalization, of those who received at least one vaccine dose. Events possibly reflecting exacerbation of orthostasis\/dysautonomia were common.Respondents did not report an increased rate of any cardiovascular events in the 30 days following COVID-19 vaccination; however, those with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome experienced a high rate of expected adverse events after vaccination consistent with a high baseline prevalence of similar symptoms. No cardiovascular events other than new abnormal heart rhythms were reported at any point after a COVID-19 illness.Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a heritable connective tissue disorder associated with generalized joint hypermobility but also other multisystem comorbidities, many of which may be exacerbated during a viral illness or after a vaccination. We sought to determine whether individuals with hypermobile Ehlers Danlos syndrome report an increase in adverse events, including cardiovascular events, after COVID-19 illness or vaccination.","1351":"In individuals with long duration T1D, SIF scores adjusted for MDI predicted all-cause mortality, although this association was attenuated after adjustments. Given the nature of sampling and small number of events, our findings require replication.This is an observational retrospective study of a convenience sample from the Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications (EDC) study. AGEs were measured with a SIF score between 2007 and 2014; vital status was assessed in 2020.We assessed the association of skin intrinsic fluorescence (SIF) scores, as a measure of advanced glycation end-products (AGE), with all-cause mortality in type 1 diabetes (T1D). months, or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).","1352":"Prions adopt alternative, self-replicating protein conformations and thereby determine novel phenotypes that are often irreversible. Nevertheless, dominant-negative prion mutants can revert phenotypes associated with some conformations. These observations suggest that, while intervention is possible, distinct inhibitors must be developed to overcome the conformational plasticity of prions. To understand the basis of this specificity, we determined the impact of the G58D mutant of the Sup35 prion on three of its conformational variants, which form amyloids in S. cerevisiae. G58D had been previously proposed to have unique effects on these variants, but our studies suggest a common mechanism. All variants, including those reported to be resistant, are inhibited by G58D but at distinct doses. G58D lowers the kinetic stability of the associated amyloid, enhancing its fragmentation by molecular chaperones, promoting Sup35 resolubilization, and leading to amyloid clearance particularly in daughter cells. Reducing the availability or activity of the chaperone Hsp104, even transiently, reverses curing. Thus, the specificity of inhibition is determined by the sensitivity of variants to the mutant dosage rather than mode of action, challenging the view that a unique inhibitor must be developed to combat each variant.","1353":". By pooling data, we estimated the incubation period, the time to seroconversion and the duration of viral shedding. We estimated the risk of Zika virus contaminated blood donations.We identified 20 articles on 25 patients with Zika virus infection. The median incubation period for the infection was estimated to be 5.9\u00a0days (95% credible interval, CrI:\u00a04.4-7.6), with 95% of people who developed symptoms doing so within 11.2\u00a0days (95% CrI:\u00a07.6-18.0) after infection. On average, seroconversion occurred 9.1\u00a0days (95% CrI:\u00a07.0-11.6) after infection. The virus was detectable in blood for 9.9\u00a0days (95% CrI:\u00a06.9-21.4) on average. Without screening, the estimated risk that a blood donation would come from an infected individual increased by approximately 1 in 10\u00a0000 for every 1\u00a0per 100\u00a0000\u00a0person-days increase in the incidence of Zika virus infection. Symptom-based screening may reduce this rate by 7% (relative risk, RR:\u00a00.93; 95% CrI:\u00a00.89-0.99) and antibody screening, by 29% (RR:\u00a00.71; 95% CrI:\u00a00.28-0.88).To estimate the timing of key events in the natural history of Zika virus infection.Neither symptom- nor antibody-based screening for Zika virus infection substantially reduced the risk that blood donations would be contaminated by the virus. Polymerase chain reaction testing should be considered for identifying blood safe for use in pregnant women in high-incidence areas.","1354":" The increasing incidence of nosocomial infections with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli represents a significant threat to public health, given the limited treatment options available for such infections. The rapid ESBL spread is suggested to be driven by localization of the resistance genes on conjugative plasmids. Here, we identify the contributions of different plasmid lineages in the nosocomial spread of ESBLs. We provide further support for plasmid-mediated spread of ESBLs but demonstrate that some ESBL genes rely on dissemination through plasmids more than the others. We identify key plasmid lineages that are enriched in major ESBL genes and highlight the encoded genetic elements that facilitate the transmission and stable maintenance of these plasmid groups within the clinical E. coli population. Overall, our work provides valuable insight into the dissemination of ESBLs through plasmids, furthering our understating of factors underlying the increased prevalence of these genes in nosocomial settings.","1355":"We initiated a nationwide prospective study to monitor RSV-related pediatric hospitalizations in 46 hospitals throughout the Netherlands between May 2021 - August 2022. We showed year-round RSV transmission in the Netherlands after an initial 2021 summer outbreak. The pattern was unprecedented and distinct from neighboring countries. We extended a dynamic simulation model to evaluate the impact of waning immunity on pediatric RSV hospitalizations in the Netherlands using four different scenarios. Our results suggest that the observed continuous RSV transmission pattern could be associated with waning immunity due to the period of very low RSV circulation during the COVID-19 pandemic.","1356":"SARS-CoV-2 superspreading occurs when transmission is highly efficient and\/or an individual infects many others, contributing to rapid spread. To better quantify heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly superspreading, we performed a systematic review of transmission events with data on secondary attack rates or contact tracing of individual index cases published before September 2021 prior to the emergence of variants of concern and widespread vaccination. We reviewed 592 distinct events and 9,883 index cases from 491 papers. A meta-analysis of secondary attack rates identified substantial heterogeneity across 12 chosen event types\/settings, with the highest transmission (25-35%) in co-living situations including households, nursing homes, and other congregate housing. Among index cases, 67% reported zero secondary cases and only 3% (287) infected >5 secondary cases (\"superspreaders\"). Index case demographic data were limited, with only 55% of individuals reporting age, sex, symptoms, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle threshold values, or total contacts. With the data available, we identified a higher percentage of superspreaders among symptomatic individuals, individuals aged 49-64\u00a0years, and individuals with over 100 total contacts. Addressing gaps in the literature regarding transmission events and contact tracing is needed to properly explain the heterogeneity in transmission and facilitate control efforts for SARS-CoV-2 and other infections.","1357":"Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is an extensively used technique to characterize antigen-antibody interactions. Affinity measurements by SPR typically involve testing the binding of antigen in solution to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) immobilized on a chip and fitting the kinetics data using 1:1 Langmuir binding model to derive rate constants. However, when it is necessary to immobilize antigens instead of the mAbs, a bivalent analyte (1:2) binding model is required for kinetics analysis. This model is lacking in data analysis packages associated with high throughput SPR instruments and the packages containing this model do not explore multiple local minima and parameter identifiability issues that are common in non-linear optimization. Therefore, we developed a method to use a system of ordinary differential equations for analyzing 1:2 binding kinetics data. Salient features of this method include a grid search on parameter initialization and a profile likelihood approach to determine parameter identifiability. Using this method we found a non-identifiable parameter in data set collected under the standard experimental design. A simulation-guided improved experimental design led to reliable estimation of all rate constants. The method and approach developed here for analyzing 1:2 binding kinetics data will be valuable for expeditious therapeutic antibody discovery research.","1358":"How much do COVID-19 vaccines reduce transmission? The answer is a moving target.","1359":"The emergence of divergent SARS-CoV-2 lineages has raised concern that novel variants eliciting immune escape or the ability to displace circulating lineages could emerge within individual hosts. Though growing evidence suggests that novel variants arise during prolonged infections, most infections are acute. Understanding how efficiently variants emerge and transmit among acutely-infected hosts is therefore critical for predicting the pace of long-term SARS-CoV-2 evolution. To characterize how within-host diversity is generated and propagated, we combine extensive laboratory and bioinformatic controls with metrics of within- and between-host diversity to 133 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from acutely-infected individuals. We find that within-host diversity is low and transmission bottlenecks are narrow, with very few viruses founding most infections. Within-host variants are rarely transmitted, even among individuals within the same household, and are rarely detected along phylogenetically linked infections in the broader community. These findings suggest that most variation generated within-host is lost during transmission.","1360":"As policies are adjusted throughout the COVID-19 pandemic according to public health best practices, there is a need to balance the importance of social distancing in preventing viral spread with the strain that these governmental public safety mandates put on public mental health. Thus, there is need for continuous observation of public sentiment and deliberation to inform further adaptation of mandated interventions. In this study, we explore how public response may be reflected in Massachusetts (MA) via social media by specifically exploring temporal patterns in Twitter posts (tweets) regarding sentiment and discussion of topics. We employ interrupted time series centered on (1) Massachusetts State of Emergency declaration (March 10), (2) US State of Emergency declaration (March 13) and (3) Massachusetts public school closure (March 17) to explore changes in tweet sentiment polarity (net negative\/positive), expressed anxiety and discussion on risk and health topics on a random subset of all tweets coded within Massachusetts and published from January 1 to May 15, 2020 (n\u00a0=\u00a02.8 million). We find significant differences between tweets published before and after mandate enforcement for Massachusetts State of Emergency (increased discussion of risk and health, decreased polarity and increased anxiety expression), US State of Emergency (increased discussion of risk and health, and increased anxiety expression) and Massachusetts public school closure (increased discussion of risk and decreased polarity). Our work further validates that Twitter data is a reasonable way to monitor public sentiment and discourse within a crisis, especially in conjunction with other observation data.","1361":"Among the U.S. cities hit by the 1918 Spanish flu, social distancing played a pivotal\r\nrole in flattening the pandemic curve. Similarly, to fight against COVID-19, restrictive mass\r\nquarantine or lockdown has been implemented as the most important controlling measure.\r\nIndia has already enforced a lockdown of 10 weeks and is extending the period depending\r\non the current disease scenario. However, the idea that, if the susceptible population drops\r\nbelow certain threshold, the infection would naturally die out in small communities after\r\na fixed time (following the outbreak), unless the disease is reintroduced from outside, was\r\nproposed by M. S. Bartlett in 1957. This threshold was termed as Critical Community Size\r\n(CCS).\r\nWe propose an Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model that explains\r\nCOVID-19 disease dynamics. Using our model, we have calculated state-specific Temporary\r\nEradication of Spread Time (TEST) and CCS that would essentially determine the ideal\r\nnumber of lockdown days required and the size of quarantined population. With the given\r\nstate-wise rates of death, recovery and other parameters, we have identified that, if at a\r\nplace the total number of susceptible population drops below CCS, infection will cease to\r\nexist after a period of expected time to extinction (TTE), unless it is re-introduced from\r\noutside. The expected TTE suggests that the disease might take a long time to fade away\r\nfrom the human population in absence of pharmaceutical interventions. But we find that\r\nthe disease might subside substantially after TEST. This would imply lockdown phases as\r\nmuch as TEST could be sufficient to contain COVID-19.","1362":"A mutation in the Ebola virus glycoprotein arose early during the 2013-2016 epidemic and dominated the viral population. Two studies by Diehl et\u00a0al. and Urbanowicz et\u00a0al. now reveal that this mutation is associated with higher infectivity to human cells, representing the clearest example of Ebola's functional adaptation to human hosts.","1363":"During outbreaks of emerging infections, the lack of effective drugs and vaccines increases reliance on non-pharmacologic public health interventions and behavior change to limit human-to-human transmission. Interventions that increase the speed with which infected individuals remove themselves from the susceptible population are paramount, particularly isolation and hospitalization. Ebola virus disease (EVD), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are zoonotic viruses that have caused significant recent outbreaks with sustained human-to-human transmission. This investigation quantified changing mean removal rates (MRR) and days from symptom onset to hospitalization (DSOH) of infected individuals from the population in seven different outbreaks of EVD, SARS, and MERS, to test for statistically significant differences in these metrics between outbreaks. We found that epidemic week and viral serial interval were correlated with the speed with which populations developed and maintained health behaviors in each outbreak.","1364":"Parasitism, driven by anthropogenic habitat modifications, is being increasingly recognized as a major threat to wildlife. Unfortunately, even baseline parasite data for most wildlife species are lacking in India, including the civets, which are particularly vulnerable due to their proximity to human habitations. Civet fecal samples were collected from 10 forest fragments that vary in size and disturbance level in Anamalai Hills, Western Ghats, India. These samples were screened for the presence of gastrointestinal parasites using fecal floatation and fecal sedimentation techniques. From a total of 180 civet fecal samples, 15 gastrointestinal parasite taxa were recovered, and these species are also known to infect domesticated animals. Additionally, small, disturbed forest fragments recorded higher mean gastrointestinal parasite taxa and greater prevalence when compared to large, undisturbed forest fragments, indicating a potential relationship between anthropogenic activities and gastrointestinal parasitism of civets in the Anamalai Hills.","1365":"Gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) is a virulent disease declining in burden but still endemic in West and Central Africa. Although it is targeted for elimination of transmission by 2030, there remain numerous questions about the drivers of infection and how these vary geographically. In this study we focus on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which accounted for 84% of the global case burden in 2016, to explore changes in transmission across the country and elucidate factors which may have contributed to the persistence of disease or success of interventions in different regions. We present a Bayesian fitting methodology, applied to 168 endemic health zones (\u223c100,000 population size), which allows for calibration of a mechanistic gHAT model to case data (from the World Health Organization HAT Atlas) in an adaptive and automated framework. It was found that the model needed to capture improvements in passive detection to match observed trends in the data within former Bandundu and Bas Congo provinces indicating these regions have substantially reduced time to detection. Health zones in these provinces generally had longer burn-in periods during fitting due to additional model parameters. Posterior probability distributions were found for a range of fitted parameters in each health zone; these included the basic reproduction number estimates for pre-1998 (R0) which was inferred to be between 1 and 1.14, in line with previous gHAT estimates, with higher median values typically in health zones with more case reporting in the 2000s. Previously, it was not clear whether a fall in active case finding in the period contributed to the declining case numbers. The modelling here accounts for variable screening and suggests that underlying transmission has also reduced greatly-on average 96% in former Equateur, 93% in former Bas Congo and 89% in former Bandundu-Equateur and Bandundu having had the highest case burdens in 2000. This analysis also sets out a framework to enable future predictions for the country.","1366":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spread by direct, indirect, or close contact with infected people via infected respiratory droplets or saliva. Crowded indoor environments with sustained close contact and conversations are a particularly high-risk setting.To prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, people are being asked to stay at home worldwide. With suspected or confirmed infections referred to isolate at home, household transmission will continue to be a significant source of transmission.We identified 40 relevant published studies that report household secondary transmission. The estimated overall household SAR was 18.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.4%-22.2%), which is higher than previously observed SARs for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We observed that household SARs were significantly higher from symptomatic index cases than asymptomatic index cases, to adult contacts than children contacts, to spouses than other family contacts, and in households with one contact than households with three or more contacts.We performed a meta-analysis through July 29, 2020 of SARS-CoV-2 household secondary attack rate (SAR), disaggregating by several covariates (contact type, symptom status, adult\/child contacts, contact sex, relationship to index case, index case sex, number of contacts in household, coronavirus).","1367":"Prediction skill is a key test of models for epidemic dynamics. However, future validation of models against out-of-sample data is rare, partly because of a lack of timely surveillance data. We address this gap by analyzing the response of rotavirus dynamics to infant vaccination. Syndromic surveillance of emergency department visits for diarrhea in New York City reveals a marked decline in diarrheal incidence among infants and young children, in line with data on rotavirus-coded hospitalizations and laboratory-confirmed cases, and a shift from annual to biennial epidemics increasingly affecting older children and adults. A published mechanistic model qualitatively predicted these patterns more than 2 years in advance. Future efforts to increase vaccination coverage may disrupt these patterns and lead to further declines in the incidence of rotavirus-attributable gastroenteritis.","1368":" steps. Assuming that actor success probability at each independent step is sigmoidally distributed and actor power follows a power-law distribution, if a biorisk event were to occur, this model shows that the expected perpetrator would likely be highly powered, despite lower-powered actors being far more numerous. However, as the number of necessary steps leading to a biological release scenario decreases, lower-powered actors can quickly overtake more powerful actors as the likely source of a given event. If steps in the risk chain are of unequal difficulty, this model shows that actors are primarily limited by the most difficult step. These results have implications for biosecurity risk assessment and health security strengthening initiatives and highlight the need to consider actor power and ensure that the steps leading to a biorisk event are sufficiently difficult and not easily bypassed.","1369":"Sea surface height (SSH) is routinely measured from satellites and used to infer ocean currents, including eddies, that affect the distribution of organisms and substances in the ocean. SSH not only reflects the dynamics of the surface layer, but also is sensitive to the fluctuations of the main pycnocline; thus it is linked to events of nutrient upwelling. Beyond episodic upwelling events, it is not clear if and how SSH is linked to broader changes in the biogeochemical state of marine ecosystems. Our analysis of 23 years of satellite observations and biogeochemical measurements from the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre shows that SSH is associated with numerous biogeochemical changes in distinct layers of the water column. From the sea surface to the depth of the chlorophyll maximum, dissolved phosphorus and nitrogen enigmatically increase with SSH, enhancing the abundance of heterotrophic picoplankton. At the deep chlorophyll maximum, increases in SSH are associated with decreases in vertical gradients of inorganic nutrients, decreases in the abundance of eukaryotic phytoplankton, and increases in the abundance of prokaryotic phytoplankton. In waters below \u223c100 m depth, increases in SSH are associated with increases in organic matter and decreases in inorganic nutrients, consistent with predicted consequences of the vertical displacement of isopycnal layers. Our analysis highlights how satellite measurements of SSH can be used to infer the ecological and biogeochemical state of open-ocean ecosystems.","1370":"A key question for infectious disease dynamics is the impact of the climate on future burden. Here, we evaluate the climate drivers of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), an important determinant of disease in young children. We combine a dataset of county-level observations from the US with state-level observations from Mexico, spanning much of the global range of climatological conditions. Using a combination of nonlinear epidemic models with statistical techniques, we find consistent patterns of climate drivers at a continental scale explaining latitudinal differences in the dynamics and timing of local epidemics. Strikingly, estimated effects of precipitation and humidity on transmission mirror prior results for influenza. We couple our model with projections for future climate, to show that temperature-driven increases to humidity may lead to a northward shift in the dynamic patterns observed and that the likelihood of severe outbreaks of RSV hinges on projections for extreme rainfall.","1371":"Many viruses have the ability to cause cells to fuse into large multi-nucleated cells, known as syncytia. While the existence of syncytia has long been known and its importance in helping spread viral infection within a host has been understood, few mathematical models have incorporated syncytia formation or examined its role in viral dynamics. This review examines mathematical models that have incorporated virus-mediated cell fusion and the insights they have provided on how syncytia can change the time course of an infection. While the modeling efforts are limited, they show promise in helping us understand the consequences of syncytia formation if future modeling efforts can be coupled with appropriate experimental efforts to help validate the models.","1372":" biofilm formation and that these effects are associated with anatomical site of isolation and whether the strain forms robust or weak biofilms.","1373":"Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) provide strong direct protection in children, while limited data are available on their indirect effect on mortality among older age groups. This multi-country study aimed to assess the population-level impact of pediatric PCVs on all-cause pneumonia mortality among \u22655 years of age, and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) cases in Chile.While an effect of PCV against pneumonia deaths (a broad clinical definition that may not be specific enough to measure indirect effects) was not detected, evidence of indirect PCV impact was observed among vaccine-type-specific IPD cases.No significant change in death rates due to all-cause pneumonia was detected following PCV introduction among most age groups and countries. The proportion of IPD cases caused by vaccine serotypes decreased from 29% (2012) to 6% (2022) among \u226565 years in Chile.Demographic and mortality data from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico were collected considering the \u2265 5-year-old population, from 2000-2019, with 1,795,789 deaths due to all-cause pneumonia. IPD cases in Chile were also evaluated. Time series models were employed to evaluate changes in all-cause pneumonia deaths during the post-vaccination period, with other causes of death used as synthetic controls for unrelated temporal trends.","1374":"Species displaying temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) are especially vulnerable to the effects of a rapidly changing global climate due to their profound sensitivity to thermal cues during development. Predicting the consequences of climate change for these species, including skewed offspring sex ratios, depends on understanding how climatic factors interface with features of maternal nesting behaviour to shape the developmental environment. Here, we measure thermal profiles in 86 nests at two geographically distinct sites in the northern and southern regions of the American alligator's (Alligator mississippiensis) geographical range, and examine the influence of both climatic factors and maternally driven nest characteristics on nest temperature variation. Changes in daily maximum air temperatures drive annual trends in nest temperatures, while variation in individual nest temperatures is also related to local habitat factors and microclimate characteristics. Without any compensatory nesting behaviours, nest temperatures are projected to increase by 1.6-3.7\u00b0C by the year 2100, and these changes are predicted to have dramatic consequences for offspring sex ratios. Exact sex ratio outcomes vary widely depending on site and emission scenario as a function of the unique temperature-by-sex reaction norm exhibited by all crocodilians. By revealing the ecological drivers of nest temperature variation in the American alligator, this study provides important insights into the potential consequences of climate change for crocodilian species, many of which are already threatened by extinction.","1375":"The collocation of individuals in different environments is an important prerequisite for exposure to infectious diseases on a social network. Standard epidemic models fail to capture the potential complexity of this scenario by (1)\u00a0neglecting the higher-order structure of contacts that typically occur through environments like workplaces, restaurants, and households, and (2)\u00a0assuming a linear relationship between the exposure to infected contacts and the risk of infection. Here, we leverage a hypergraph model to embrace the heterogeneity of environments and the heterogeneity of individual participation in these environments. We find that combining heterogeneous exposure with the concept of minimal infective dose induces a universal nonlinear relationship between infected contacts and infection risk. Under nonlinear infection kernels, conventional epidemic wisdom breaks down with the emergence of discontinuous transitions, superexponential spread, and hysteresis.","1376":"Parallel (and convergent) phenotypic variation is most often studied in the wild, where it is difficult to disentangle genetic vs. environmentally induced effects. As a result, the potential contributions of phenotypic plasticity to parallelism (and nonparallelism) are rarely evaluated in a formal sense. Phenotypic parallelism could be enhanced by plasticity that causes stronger parallelism across populations in the wild than would be expected from genetic differences alone. Phenotypic parallelism could be dampened if site\u2010specific plasticity induced differences between otherwise genetically parallel populations. We used a common\u2010garden study of three independent lake\u0096stream stickleback population pairs to evaluate the extent to which adaptive divergence has a genetic or plastic basis, and to investigate the enhancing vs. dampening effects of plasticity on phenotypic parallelism. We found that lake\u0096stream differences in most traits had a genetic basis, but that several traits also showed contributions from plasticity. Moreover, plasticity was much more prevalent in one watershed than in the other two. In most cases, plasticity enhanced phenotypic parallelism, whereas in a few cases, plasticity had a dampening effect. Genetic and plastic contributions to divergence seem to play a complimentary, likely adaptive, role in phenotypic parallelism of lake\u0096stream stickleback. These findings highlight the value of formally comparing wild\u2010caught and laboratory\u2010reared individuals in the study of phenotypic parallelism.","1377":"We considered how participatory syndromic surveillance data can be used to estimate influenza attack rates during the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 seasons in the United States. Our inference is based on assessing the difference in the rates of self-reported influenza-like illness (ILI, defined as presence of fever and cough\/sore throat) among the survey participants during periods of active vs. low influenza circulation as well as estimating the probability of self-reported ILI for influenza cases. Here, we combined Flu Near You data with additional sources (Hong Kong household studies of symptoms of influenza cases and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates of vaccine coverage and effectiveness) to estimate influenza attack rates. The estimated influenza attack rate for the early vaccinated Flu Near You members (vaccination reported by week 45) aged 20-64 between calendar weeks 47-12 was 14.7%(95% CI(5.9%,24.1%)) for the 2012-2013 season and 3.6%(-3.3%,10.3%) for the 2013-2014 season. The corresponding rates for the US population aged 20-64 were 30.5% (4.4%, 49.3%) in 2012-2013 and 7.1%(-5.1%, 32.5%) in 2013-2014. The attack rates in women and men were similar each season. Our findings demonstrate that participatory syndromic surveillance data can be used to gauge influenza attack rates during future influenza seasons. ","1378":"The replacement of forest areas with human-dominated landscapes usually leads to fragmentation, altering the structure and function of the forest. Here we studied the dynamics of forest patch sizes at a global level, examining signals of a critical transition from an unfragmented to a fragmented state, using the MODIS vegetation continuous field. We defined wide regions of connected forest across continents and big islands, and combined five criteria, including the distribution of patch sizes and the fluctuations of the largest patch over the last sixteen years, to evaluate the closeness of each region to a fragmentation threshold. Regions with the highest deforestation rates-South America, Southeast Asia, Africa-all met these criteria and may thus be near a critical fragmentation threshold. This implies that if current forest loss rates are maintained, wide continental areas could suddenly fragment, triggering extensive species loss and degradation of ecosystems services.","1379":"Fresh water demand is rising due to factors such as population growth, economic development, and land use changes. At the same time, climate change is rendering the water supply even more uncertain for the future. Due to recurring water restrictions and increasing water-related fees triggered by droughts and water shortages, there is a widespread, growing discomfort with respect to future water availability. Among key stakeholders and local policy makers, this has led to an increased interest in modeling the availability of water resources, with the aim of developing and implementing the appropriate water resource infrastructure and management strategies. This paper examines the Washington metropolitan area (WMA) water supply system and uses a system dynamics approach as a planning tool to make an exploratory assessment of the adequacy of the study area\u0092s water supply system to meet future water demand under the influence of substantial droughts and climate change. This assessment finds that the study area is self-sufficient under normal climate conditions during the entire planning horizon but that it will be strained under moderately severe droughts. On the basis of the temperature, streamflow and precipitation projections made by climate change models specific to the WMA region, climate change is expected to improve the water supply reliability. However, climate change has uncertainty associated with it. One of the four climate models for the Potomac River basin projects a decrease in the precipitation and streamflow, which may result in a reduction in the water supply and the system\u0092s reliability. Regulating the price and the system losses are valuable tools that can be leveraged. But these policy interventions require stakeholder participation (price regulation) and capital investments (reduction of distribution losses). Finally, system reliability can also be improved by increasing water supplies.","1380":" Living in a neighborhood with a high proportion of linguistically isolated households predicted higher mortality among older Mexican Americans. Addressing the social capital shortage in linguistically isolated neighborhoods is one way to address health disparities in the United States.","1381":"Parasite infections are ubiquitous and their effects on hosts could play a role in ecosystem processes. Ecological stoichiometry provides a framework to study linkages between consumers and their resource, such as parasites and their host, and ecosystem process; however, the stoichiometric traits of host-parasite associations are rarely quantified. Specifically, it is unclear whether parasites' elemental ratios closely resemble those of their host or if infection is related to host stoichiometry, especially in vertebrate hosts. To answer such questions, we measured the elemental content (%C, %N, and %P) and molar ratios (C:N, C:P, and N:P) of parasitized and unparasitized Gasterosteus aculeatus (three-spined stickleback) and their cestode parasite, Schistocephalus solidus. Host and parasite elemental content were distinct from each other, and parasites were generally higher in %C and lower in %N and %P. Parasite infections were related to host C:N, with infected hosts being lower in C:N. Parasite elemental content was independent of their host, but parasite body mass and parasite density were important drivers of parasite stoichiometry. Overall, these potential effects of parasite infections on host stoichiometry along with parasites' distinct elemental compositions suggest parasites may further contribute to differences in how individual hosts store and recycle nutrients.","1382":"Using publicly available data on the number of new hospitalisations we use a newly developed statistical model to produce a phase portrait to monitor the epidemic allowing for assessing whether or not intervention measures are needed to keep hospital capacity under control. The phase portrait is called a cliquets' diagram, referring to the discrete alarm phases it points to. Using this cliquets' diagram we show that intervention measures were associated with an effective mitigation of a Summer resurgence but that too little too late was done to prevent a large autumn wave in Belgium.","1383":"Aims\r\nQuantitative data on the doses needed to inactivate micro\u2010organisms on fomites are not available for ultraviolet applications. The goal of this study was to determine the doses of UV light needed to reduce bacteria and murine norovirus (MNV) on hard surface fomites through experimentation and to identify appropriate models for predicting targeted levels of reduction.\r\n\r\nMethods and Results\r\nStainless steel and Formica laminate coupons were selected as they are common surfaces found in healthcare settings. Test organisms included methicillin\u2010resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA ), vancomycin\u2010resistant Enterococcus (VRE ), Clostridium difficile and MNV. The fomites were inoculated with 105\u0096107 bacteria or virus and exposed to a range of UV doses. The order of resistance to UV irradiation was virus, bacterial spore and vegetative cell. The best fitting inactivation curves suggested nonlinear responses to increasing doses after a 3\u00964 log reduction in the test organisms. The average UV doses required for a 3 log reduction in the C. difficile , MRSA and VRE were 16 000, 6164 and 11 228 (mJ \u2010s cm\u22122) for stainless steel, respectively, and 16 000, 11 727 and 12 441 (mJ \u2010s cm\u22122) for Formica laminate, respectively.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nHigher UV light doses are required to inactivate bacteria and viruses on hard surfaces than in suspension. Greater doses are needed to inactivate bacterial spores and MNV compared to vegetative bacteria.\r\n\r\nSignificance and Impact of the Study\r\nQuantitative data and models on UV light doses needed to inactivate bacteria and MNV on hard surfaces are now available. The generalizable results of this study can be used to estimate required UV dosages to achieve targeted levels of inactivation based on estimated levels of contamination or to support quantitative microbial risk assessments.","1384":" cells that leads to protection or causation of autoimmunity.","1385":"This analysis provides evidence to inform the design of pneumococcal meningitis outbreak response guidelines. Countries should consider reactive vaccination in each outbreak event, together with maintaining routine infant vaccination as the primary intervention to reduce pneumococcal disease burden and outbreak risk.Pneumococcal meningitis outbreaks occur sporadically in the African meningitis belt. Outbreak control guidelines and interventions are well established for meningococcal but not pneumococcal meningitis. Mathematical modelling is a useful tool for assessing the potential impact of different pneumococcal control strategies. This work aimed to estimate the impact of reactive vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) had it been implemented in past African meningitis belt outbreaks and assess their efficiency relative to existing routine infant immunisation with PCV.Using recent pneumococcal meningitis outbreaks in Burkina Faso, Chad, and Ghana as case studies, we investigated the potential impact of reactive vaccination. We calculated the number needed to vaccinate to avert one case (NNV) in each outbreak setting and over all outbreaks and compared this to the NNV for existing routine infant vaccination. We extended previous analyses of reactive vaccination by considering longer-term protection in vaccinees over five years, incorporating a proxy for indirect effects. We found that implementing reactive vaccination in previous pneumococcal meningitis outbreaks could have averted up to 10-20\u00a0% of outbreak cases, with the biggest potential impact in Brong Ahafo, Ghana (2015-2016) and Goundi, Chad (2009). The NNV, and hence the value of reactive vaccination, varied greatly. 'Large' (80\u00a0+\u00a0cumulative modelled cases per 100,000 population) and\/or 'prolonged' (exceeding a response threshold of 10 suspected cases per 100,000 per week for four weeks or more) outbreaks had NNV estimates under 10,000. For routine infant vaccination with PCV, the estimated NNV ranged from 3,100-5,600 in Burkina Faso and 1,500-2,600 in Ghana.","1386":"The dynamics of infectious diseases propagating in populations depends both on human interaction patterns, the contagion process and the pathogenesis within hosts. The immune system follows a circadian rhythm and, consequently, the chance of getting infected varies with the time of day an individual is exposed to the pathogen. The movement and interaction of people also follow 24-hour cycles, which couples these two phenomena. We use a stochastic metapopulation model informed by hourly mobility data for two medium-sized Chinese cities. By this setup, we investigate how the epidemic risk depends on the difference of the clocks governing the population movement and the immune systems. In most of the scenarios we test, we observe circadian rhythms would constrain the pace and extent of disease emergence. The three measures (strength, outward transmission and introduction speeds) are highly correlated with each other. For example of the Yushu City, outward transmission speed and introduction speed are correlated with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.83, and the speeds correlate to strength with coefficients of -0.85 and -0.75, respectively (all have p < 0.05), in simulations with no circadian effect and R0 = 1.5. The relation between the circadian rhythms of the immune system and daily routines in human mobility can affect the pace and extent of infectious disease spreading. Shifting commuting times could mitigate the emergence of outbreaks.","1387":"This analysis adds to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the positive impact of population-level HPV vaccination among young women that appears similar across area-based measures of sociodemographic characteristics. Monitoring is necessary to ensure the continuation of this progress in all communities.Trends in the incidence of precancerous cervical lesions can be monitored to evaluate the impact of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. The objective of this analysis was to determine whether declines in precancerous cervical lesions varied by area-based measures of poverty, race, and ethnicity.During 2008-2018 in Connecticut, 18 878 women aged 21-39 were diagnosed with precancerous cervical lesions. After adjusting for screening, the largest declines occurred among women aged 21-24 (AAPC = -11.5%; 95% CI, -13.6% to -9.4%). We found significant and similar annual declines (~10%-12%) in this age group across all 4 levels of poverty, race, and ethnicity.We analyzed 11 years of incidence data (2008-2018) from a statewide active surveillance system of precancerous cervical lesions in Connecticut. We divided area-based measures of poverty, race, and ethnicity (percentage of the population in a census tract who were living below the federal poverty level, who were Black, and who were Hispanic) at the census-tract level into 4 groups (<5.0%, 5.0%-9.9%, 10.0%-19.9%, \u226520.0%) using recommended cut points from the Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project. We estimated incidence rates and average annual percentage changes (AAPCs) stratified by age and each area-based measure using Joinpoint regression software. We used total population and estimated screened population as denominators for each age group to calculate rates and AAPCs.","1388":"In the United States, cocaine use and mortality have surged in the past 5 years. Considering cocaine's reputation as a fashionable social drug, the rise of cocaine mentions in popular music may provide a signal of epidemiological trends of cocaine use. We characterized the relationship between mentions of cocaine in song lyrics and incidence of cocaine use and mortality in the US. Incidence of cocaine use from 2002 to 2017 was obtained from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health and cocaine overdose mortality rate from 2000 to 2017 was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control. Distributed lag models were fit using ordinary least squares on the first difference to identify associations between changes in cocaine lyric mentions and changes in incidence of cocaine use and mortality. A total of 5955 song lyrics with cocaine mentions were obtained from Lyrics.com. Cocaine mentions in song lyrics were stable from 2000 to 2010 then increased by 190% from 2010 to 2017. The first-order distributed lag model estimated that a 0.01 increase in mentions of cocaine in song lyrics is associated with an 11% increase in incidence of cocaine use within the same year and a 14% increase in cocaine mortality with a 2-year lag. Lag-times were confirmed with cross-correlation analyses and the association remained after accounting for street pricing of cocaine. Mentions of cocaine in song lyrics are associated with the rise of incidence of cocaine use and cocaine overdose mortality. Popular music trends are a potentially valuable tool for understanding cocaine epidemiology trends.","1389":"During its first 2 years, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic manifested as multiple waves shaped by complex interactions between variants of concern, non-pharmaceutical interventions, and the immunological landscape of the population. Understanding how the age-specific epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 has evolved throughout the pandemic is crucial for informing policy decisions. In this article, we aimed to develop an inference-based modeling approach to reconstruct the burden of true infections and hospital admissions in children, adolescents, and adults over the seven waves of four variants (wild-type, Alpha, Delta, and Omicron BA.1) during the first 2 years of the pandemic, using the Netherlands as the motivating example. We find that reported cases are a considerable underestimate and a generally poor predictor of true infection burden, especially because case reporting differs by age. The contribution of children and adolescents to total infection and hospitalization burden increased with successive variants and was largest during the Omicron BA.1 period. However, the ratio of hospitalizations to infections decreased with each subsequent variant in all age categories. Before the Delta period, almost all infections were primary infections occurring in naive individuals. During the Delta and Omicron BA.1 periods, primary infections were common in children but relatively rare in adults who experienced either reinfections or breakthrough infections. Our approach can be used to understand age-specific epidemiology through successive waves in other countries where random community surveys uncovering true SARS-CoV-2 dynamics are absent but basic surveillance and statistics data are available.","1390":", inferring the membrane properties can be done indirectly from pH measurements. Numerical simulations based on recent models of the surface pH support the hypothesis that the presence of a measurement device, a liquid-membrane pH sensitive electrode on the cell surface may disturb locally the pH, leading to a systematic bias in the measured values. To take this phenomenon into account, it is necessary to equip the model with a description of the micro-environment created by the pH electrode. In this work we propose a novel, computationally lightweight numerical algorithm to simulate the surface pH data. The effect of different parameters of the model on the output are investigated through a series of numerical experiments with a physica interpretation.","1391":"Motivated by the need to jointly model the longitudinal trajectories of HIV viral load levels and CD4 counts during the primary infection stage, we propose a joint penalized spline modeling approach that can be used to model the repeated measurements from multiple biomarkers of various types (eg, continuous, binary) simultaneously. This approach allows for flexible trajectories for each marker, accounts for potentially time-varying correlation between markers, and is robust to misspecification of knots. Despite its advantages, the application of multivariate penalized spline models, especially when biomarkers may be of different data types, has been limited in part due to its seemingly complexity in implementation. To overcome this, we describe a procedure that transforms the multivariate setting to the univariate one, and then makes use of the generalized linear mixed effect model representation of a penalized spline model to facilitate its implementation with standard statistical software. We performed simulation studies to evaluate the validity and efficiency through joint modeling of correlated biomarkers measured longitudinally compared to the univariate modeling approach. We applied this modeling approach to longitudinal HIV-1 RNA load and CD4 count data from Southern African cohorts to estimate features of the joint distributions such as the correlation and the proportion of subjects with high viral load levels and high CD4 cell counts over\u00a0time.","1392":"Vector-borne transmission of Chagas disease in urban areas of Argentina has been an overlooked phenomena.

Healthcare systems face complex choices between multiple highly efficacious, costly treatments. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of HCV treatments for chronic, genotype 1 HCV monoinfected, treatment-na\u00efve individuals in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and general U.S. healthcare systems.We conducted a decision-analytic Markov model-based cost-effectiveness analysis, employing appropriate payer perspectives and time horizons, and discounting benefits and costs at 3% annually. Interventions included: Sofosbuvir\/ledipasvir (SOF-LDV); ombitasvir\/paritaprevir\/ritonavir\/dasabuvir (3D); sofosbuvir\/simeprevir (SOF-SMV); sofosbuvir\/pegylated interferon\/ribavirin (SOF-RBV-PEG); boceprevir\/pegylated interferon\/ribavirin (BOC-RBV-PEG); and pegylated interferon\/ribavirin (PEG-RBV). Outcomes were sustained virologic response (SVR), advanced liver disease, costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness.SOF-LDV and 3D achieve higher SVR rates compared to older regimens and reduce advanced liver disease (>20% relative to no treatment), increasing QALYs by over 2 years per person. For the non-VA population, at current prices ($5,040 per week for SOF-LDV and $4,796 per week for 3D), SOF-LDV's lifetime cost ($293,370) is $18,000 lower than 3D's because of its shorter treatment duration in subgroups. SOF-LDV costs $17,100 per QALY gained relative to no treatment. 3D costs $208,000 per QALY gained relative to SOF-LDV. Both dominate other treatments and are even more cost-effective for the VA, though VA aggregate treatment costs still exceed $4 billion at SOF-LDV prices of $3,308 per week. Drug prices strongly determine relative cost-effectiveness for SOF-LDV and 3D; With sufficient price reductions (approximately 20-30% depending on the health system), 3D could be cost-effective relative to SOF-LDV. Limitations include the lack of long-term head-to-head regimen effectiveness trials.","1395":" isolates from Tororo and Busia districts in Uganda. genetic polymorphisms were characterised by molecular methods.

When winter wanes and temperatures increase, so too do vital rates of both ectothermic hosts and their parasites. Due to metabolic scaling, if parasite activity springs back faster than host immune functions then cold seasons and transitions between cold and warm seasons may represent periods of vulnerability for ectothermic hosts. Understanding host regulation of physiological rates at seasonal junctions is a first step toward identifying thermal mismatches between hosts and parasites. Here we show that immune gene expression is responsive to transitions into and out of the cold season in a winter-adapted amphibian, the wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus), and that frogs experienced parasitism by at least two nematode species throughout the entirety of the cold season. In both splenic and skin tissues, we observed a decrease in immune gene expression going from fall to winter, observed no changes between winter and emergence from hibernation, and observed increases in immune gene expression after hibernation ended. At all timepoints, differentially expressed genes from spleens were more highly enriched for immune system processes than those from ventral skin, especially with respect to terms related to adaptive immune processes. Infection with nematode lungworms was also associated with upregulation of immune processes in the spleen. We suggest that rather than being a period of stagnation, during which physiological processes and infection potential cease, the cold season is immunologically dynamic, requiring coordinated regulation of many biological processes, and that the reemergence period may be an important time during which hosts invest in preparatory immunity.","1397":"The global impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to considerable interest in detecting novel beneficial mutations and other genomic changes that may signal the development of variants of concern (VOCs). The ability to accurately detect these changes within individual patient samples is important in enabling early detection of VOCs. Such genomic scans for rarely acting positive selection are best performed via comparison of empirical data to simulated data wherein commonly acting evolutionary factors, including mutation and recombination, reproductive and infection dynamics, and purifying and background selection, can be carefully accounted for and parameterized. While there has been work to quantify these factors in SARS-CoV-2, they have yet to be integrated into a baseline model describing intra-host evolutionary dynamics. To construct such a baseline model, we develop a simulation framework that enables one to establish expectations for underlying levels and patterns of patient-level variation. By varying eight key parameters, we evaluated 12,096 different model-parameter combinations and compared them to existing empirical data. Of these, 592 models (\u223c5%) were plausible based on the resulting mean expected number of segregating variants. These plausible models shared several commonalities shedding light on intra-host SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary dynamics: severe infection bottlenecks, low levels of reproductive skew, and a distribution of fitness effects skewed towards strongly deleterious mutations. We also describe important areas of model uncertainty and highlight additional sequence data that may help to further refine a baseline model. This study lays the groundwork for the improved analysis of existing and future SARS-CoV-2 within-patient data.","1398":"The COVID-19 pandemic has not only presented a major global public health and socio-economic crisis, but has also significantly impacted human behavior towards adherence (or lack thereof) to public health intervention and mitigation measures implemented in communities worldwide. This study is based on the use of mathematical modeling approaches to assess the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics is impacted by population-level changes of human behavior due to factors such as (a) the severity of transmission (such as disease-induced mortality and level of symptomatic transmission), (b) fatigue due to the implementation of mitigation interventions measures (e.g., lockdowns) over a long (extended) period of time, (c) social peer-pressure, among others. A novel behavior-epidemiology model, which takes the form of a deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations, is developed and fitted using observed cumulative SARS-CoV-2 mortality data during the first wave in the United States. The model fits the observed data, as well as makes a more accurate prediction of the observed daily SARS-CoV-2 mortality during the first wave (March 2020-June 2020), in comparison to the equivalent model which does not explicitly account for changes in human behavior. This study suggests that, as more newly-infected individuals become asymptomatically-infectious, the overall level of positive behavior change can be expected to significantly decrease (while new cases may rise, particularly if asymptomatic individuals have higher contact rate, in comparison to symptomatic individuals).","1399":"Contact tracing is a crucial part of the public health surveillance toolkit. However, it is labor-intensive and costly to carry it out. Some countries have faced challenges implementing contact tracing, and no impact evaluations using empirical data have assessed its impact on COVID-19 mortality. This study assesses the impact of contact tracing in a middle-income country, providing data to support the expansion and optimization of contact tracing strategies to improve infection control.We obtained publicly available data on all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Colombia between March 2 and June 16, 2020. (N = 54,931 cases over 135 days of observation). As suggested by WHO guidelines, we proxied contact tracing performance as the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing out of all cases identified. We calculated the daily proportion of cases identified through contact tracing across 37 geographical units (32 departments and five districts). Further, we used a sequential log-log fixed-effects model to estimate the 21-days, 28-days, 42-days, and 56-days lagged impact of the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing on daily COVID-19 mortality. Both the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing and the daily number of COVID-19 deaths are smoothed using 7-day moving averages. Models control for the prevalence of active cases, second-degree polynomials, and mobility indices. Robustness checks to include supply-side variables were performed.Contact tracing is instrumental in containing infectious diseases. Its prioritization as a surveillance strategy will substantially impact reducing deaths while minimizing the impact on the fragile economic systems of lower and middle-income countries. This study provides lessons for other LMIC.We found that a 10 percent increase in the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing is related to COVID-19 mortality reductions between 0.8% and 3.4%. Our models explain between 47%-70% of the variance in mortality. Results are robust to changes of specification and inclusion of supply-side variables.","1400":"Two nurses performed in-person observation of multidisciplinary ICU rounds. Using a standardized paper-based assessment tool, each nurse indicated whether 17 items related to the ABCDEF bundle were discussed during rounds. For each item, generalizability coefficients were used as a measure of reliability, with a single-rater value of 0.70 or greater considered sufficient to support its assessment by 1 nurse.The nurse observers assessed 118 patient discussions across 15 observation days. For 11 of 17 items (65%), the generalizability coefficient for a single rater met or exceeded the 0.70 threshold. The generalizability coefficients (95% CIs) of a single rater for key items were as follows: pain, 0.86 (0.74-0.97); delirium score, 0.74 (0.64-0.83); agitation score, 0.72 (0.33-1.00); spontaneous awakening trial, 0.67 (0.49-0.83); spontaneous breathing trial, 0.80 (0.70-0.89); mobility, 0.79 (0.69-0.87); and family (future\/past) engagement, 0.82 (0.73-0.90).Using a paper-based assessment tool, a single trained critical care nurse can reliably assess the discussion of elements of the ABCDEF bundle during multidisciplinary rounds.Nurse-led rounding checklists are a common strategy for facilitating evidence-based practice in the intensive care unit (ICU). To streamline checklist workflow, some ICUs have the nurse or another individual listen to the conversation and customize the checklist for each patient.

However, comprehensive generation time estimates for seasonal influenza, especially post the 2009 influenza pandemic, are lacking. We estimated the generation time utilizing data from a 7-site case-ascertained household study in the United States over two influenza seasons, 2021\/2022 and 2022\/2023. More than 200 individuals who tested positive for influenza and their household contacts were enrolled within 7 days of the first illness in the household. All participants were prospectively followed for 10 days completing daily symptom diaries and collecting nasal swabs, which were tested for influenza via RT-PCR. We analyzed these data by modifying a previously published Bayesian data augmentation approach that imputes infection times of cases to obtain both intrinsic (assuming no susceptible depletion) and realized (observed within household) generation times. We assessed the robustness of the generation time estimate by varying the incubation period, and generated estimates of the proportion of transmission before symptomatic onset, infectious period, and latent period. We estimated a mean intrinsic generation time of 3.2 (95% credible interval, CrI: 2.9-3.6) days, with a realized household generation time of 2.8 (95% CrI: 2.7-3.0) days. The generation time exhibited limited sensitivity to incubation period variation. Estimates of the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, the infectious period, and the latent period were sensitive to variation in incubation periods. Our study contributes to the ongoing efforts to refine estimates of the generation time for influenza. Our estimates, derived from recent data following the COVID-19 pandemic, are consistent with previous pre-pandemic estimates, and will be incorporated into real-time Rt estimation efforts.","1402":"Invasive species that form mutualistic interactions can perturb resident communities by creating new interactions, or weakening the strength of existing interactions via competition. We hypothesized that introducing a super-generalist plant species to bee-plant networks would lead to (1) increases in the weighted and unweighted average degree, nestedness, and connectance and (2) decreases in the modularity. We constructed visitation networks of bees to five native plant species in experimental research plots, in the presence and absence of an invasive thistle and while varying thistle abundance and time\/duration of introduction. Species introduction did not change the visitation rate of bees to co-occurring native plants, or the interaction structure between the native plant species and bee visitors; seed set of a focal native plant species was also unaffected. We found the number of bee species with which the introduced species interacted (generality) correlated with significant increases in unweighted and weighted average degree, nestedness, and connectance, but not modularity. When comparing the impact of the introduced species either early or late in the season, we found similar relationships between introduced species generality and weighted and unweighted average degree and connectance; there was a significant negative relationship between introduced species generality and modularity early in the season, and a significant positive relationship with nestedness late in the season, suggesting introduction timing within a season may affect some measures differently.

The invasive tick species Haemaphysalis longicornis poses a significant public health threat due to its global expansion and its potential to carry a wide range of pathogens. We analyzed meta-transcriptomic data from 3595 adult H. longicornis ticks collected between 2016 and 2019 in 22 provinces across China, encompassing diverse ecological conditions. Generalized additive modelling revealed that climate factors exerted a stronger influence on the virome of H. longicornis compared to other ecological factors, such as ecotypes, distance to coastline, animal host, tick gender, and anti-viral immunity. We investigated the mechanistic understanding of how climate changes drive the tick virome using causality inference and emphasized its significance for public health. Our findings demonstrated that higher temperatures and lower relative humidity\/precipitation contribute to variations in animal host diversity, leading to an increased diversity of tick virome, particularly the evenness of vertebrate associated viruses. This finding may explain the evolution of tick-borne viruses into generalists across multiple hosts, thereby increasing the probability of spillover events involving tick-borne pathogens. Deep learning projections indicate that the diversity of H. longicornis virome is expected to increase in 81.9% of regions under the SSP8.5 scenario from 2019-2030. Extension of surveillance should be implemented to avert the spread of tick-borne diseases.","1405":"Diseases and other contagion phenomena in nature and society can interact asymmetrically, such that one can benefit from the other, which in turn impairs the first, in analogy with predator-prey systems. Here, we consider two models for interacting diseaselike dynamics with asymmetric interactions and different associated time scales. Using rate equations for homogeneously mixed populations, we show that the stationary prevalences and phase diagrams of each model behave differently with respect to variations of the relative time scales. We also characterize in detail the regime where transient oscillations are observed, a pattern that is inherent to asymmetrical interactions but often ignored in the literature. Our results contribute to a better understanding of disease dynamics in particular, and interacting processes in general, and could provide interesting insights for real-world applications.","1406":" (CRKP) is an antibiotic resistance threat of the highest priority. Given the limited treatment options for this multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO), there is an urgent need for targeted strategies to prevent transmission. Here, we applied whole-genome sequencing to a comprehensive collection of clinical isolates to reconstruct regional transmission pathways and analyzed this transmission network in the context of statewide patient transfer data and patient-level clinical data to identify drivers of regional transmission. We found that high regional CRKP burdens were due to a small number of regional introductions, with subsequent regional proliferation occurring via patient transfers among health care facilities. While CRKP was predicted to have been imported into each facility multiple times, there was substantial variation in the ratio of intrafacility transmission events per importation, indicating that amplification occurs unevenly across regional facilities. While myriad factors likely influence intrafacility transmission rates, an understudied one is the potential for clinical characteristics of colonized and infected patients to influence their propensity for transmission. Supporting the contribution of high-risk patients to elevated transmission rates, we observed that patients colonized and infected with CRKP in high-transmission facilities had higher rates of carbapenem use, malnutrition, and dialysis and were older. This report highlights the potential for regional infection prevention efforts that are grounded in genomic epidemiology to identify the patients and facilities that make the greatest contribution to regional MDRO prevalence, thereby facilitating the design of precision interventions of maximal impact.","1407":"Vaccination programs generate direct protection, herd protection and, occasionally, side effects, distributed over different age groups. This study elicits the general public's view on how to balance these outcomes in funding decisions for vaccines. We performed an optimal design discrete choice experiment with partial profiles in a representative sample (N\u202f=\u202f1499) of the population in the United Kingdom in November 2016. Using a panel mixed logit model, we quantified, for four different types of infectious disease, the importance of a person's age during disease, how disease was prevented-via direct vaccine protection or herd protection-and whether the vaccine induced side effects. Our study shows clear patterns in how the public values vaccination programs. These diverge from the assumptions made in public health and cost-effectiveness models that inform decision-making. We found that side effects and infections in newborns and children were of primary importance to the perceived value of a vaccination program. Averting side effects was, in any age group, weighted three times as important as preventing an identical natural infection in a child whereas the latter was weighted six times as important as preventing the same infection in elderly aged 65-75 years. These findings were independent of the length or severity of the disease, and were robust across respondents' backgrounds. We summarize these patterns in a set of preference weights that can be incorporated into future models. Although the normative significance of these weights remains a matter open for debate, our study can, hopefully, contribute to the evaluation of vaccination programs beyond cost-effectiveness.","1408":"Scrub typhus is a climate-sensitive and life-threatening vector-borne disease that poses a growing public health threat. Although the climate-epidemic associations of many vector-borne diseases have been studied for decades, the impacts of climate on scrub typhus remain poorly understood, especially in the context of global warming. Here we incorporate Chinese national surveillance data on scrub typhus from 2010 to 2019 into a climate-driven generalized additive mixed model to explain the spatiotemporal dynamics of this disease and predict how it may be affected by climate change under various representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for three future time periods (the 2030s, 2050s, and 2080s). Our results demonstrate that temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity play key roles in driving the seasonal epidemic of scrub typhus in mainland China with a 2-month lag. Our findings show that the change of projected spatiotemporal dynamics of scrub typhus will be heterogeneous and will depend on specific combinations of regional climate conditions in future climate scenarios. Our results contribute to a better understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics of scrub typhus, which can help public health authorities refine their prevention and control measures to reduce the risks resulting from climate change.","1409":"Detecting and monitoring the transmission of arboviruses such as Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus, and chikungunya virus is critical for prevention and control activities. Previous work has compared the ability of different human-focused surveillance strategies to detect ZIKV transmission in U.S. counties where no known transmission had occurred, but whether virological surveillance in mosquitoes could represent an effective surveillance system is unclear.We leveraged a unique set of data from human and virological surveillance in Ae. aegypti during the 2016 ZIKV epidemic in Caguas, Puerto Rico, to compare alternative strategies for detecting and monitoring ZIKV activity.In simulated high transmission scenarios (1 infection per 1,000 people per week), the models demonstrated that both approaches had estimated probabilities of detection of greater than 78%. In simulated low incidence scenarios, vector surveillance had higher sensitivity than human surveillance and sensitivity increased with more traps, more trapping effort, and testing. In contrast, the actual data from Caguas indicated that human virological surveillance was more sensitive than vector virological surveillance during periods of both high and low transmission.We developed a simulation model for mosquito and human surveillance strategies and simulated different transmission scenarios with varying infection rates and mosquito trap densities. We then calculated the expected weekly number of detected infections, the probability of detecting transmission, and the number of tests needed and compared the simulations with observed data from Caguas.In scenarios where human surveillance is not possible or when transmission intensity is very low, virological surveillance in Ae. aegypti may be able to detect and monitor ZIKV epidemic activity. However, surveillance for humans seeking care for Zika-like symptoms likely provides an equivalent or more sensitive indicator of transmission intensity in most circumstances.","1410":"Heterogeneous exposure to mosquitoes determines an individual's contribution to vector-borne pathogen transmission. Particularly for dengue virus (DENV), there is a major difficulty in quantifying human-vector contacts due to the unknown coupled effect of key heterogeneities. To test the hypothesis that the reduction of human out-of-home mobility due to dengue illness will significantly influence population-level dynamics and the structure of DENV transmission chains, we extended an existing modeling framework to include social structure, disease-driven mobility reductions, and heterogeneous transmissibility from different infectious groups. Compared to a baseline model, na\u00efve to human pre-symptomatic infectiousness and disease-driven mobility changes, a model including both parameters predicted an increase of 37% in the probability of a DENV outbreak occurring; a model including mobility change alone predicted a 15.5% increase compared to the baseline model. At the individual level, models including mobility change led to a reduction of the importance of out-of-home onward transmission (R, the fraction of secondary cases predicted to be generated by an individual) by symptomatic individuals (up to -62%) at the expense of an increase in the relevance of their home (up to +40%). An individual's positive contribution to R could be predicted by a GAM including a non-linear interaction between an individual's biting suitability and the number of mosquitoes in their home (>10 mosquitoes and 0.6 individual attractiveness significantly increased R). We conclude that the complex fabric of social relationships and differential behavioral response to dengue illness cause the fraction of symptomatic DENV infections to concentrate transmission in specific locations, whereas asymptomatic carriers (including individuals in their pre-symptomatic period) move the virus throughout the landscape. Our findings point to the difficulty of focusing vector control interventions reactively on the home of symptomatic individuals, as this approach will fail to contain virus propagation by visitors to their house and asymptomatic carriers.","1411":" was used to convert the video clips into 18 facial action units (FAUs). Five classification models were used, including logistic regression, multilayer perception, na\u00efve Bayes, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM). Out of the models that only used FAU described in the literature (FAU 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 25, 26, 27, and 45), multilayer perception is the most accurate, at 50%. The SVM model using FAU 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 10, 12, 20, 25, and 45, and gender had the best accuracy of 58% among the machine learning selection features. Our open-source experiment for automatically analyzing video clips for FAUs is not robust for classifying pain in the elderly. The consensus method to transform facial recognition algorithm values comparable to the human ratings, and international good practice for reciprocal sharing of data may improve the accuracy and feasibility of the machine learning's facial pain rater.","1412":"University students have higher average number of contacts than the general population. Students returning to university campuses may exacerbate COVID-19 dynamics in the surrounding community.We developed a dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in a mid-sized city currently experiencing a low infection rate. We evaluated the impact of 20,000 university students arriving on September 1 in terms of cumulative COVID-19 infections, time to peak infections, and the timing and peak level of critical care occupancy. We also considered how these impacts might be mitigated through screening interventions targeted to students.University students are highly inter-connected with the surrounding off-campus community. Screening targeted at this population provides significant public health benefits to the community through averted infections, critical care admissions, and COVID-19 deaths.If arriving students reduce their contacts by 40% compared to pre-COVID levels, the total number of infections in the community increases by 115% (from 3,515 to 7,551), with 70% of the incremental infections occurring in the general population, and an incremental 19 COVID-19 deaths. Screening students every 5 days reduces the number of infections attributable to the student population by 42% and the total COVID-19 deaths by 8. One-time mass screening of students prevents fewer infections than 5-day screening, but is more efficient, requiring 196 tests needed to avert one infection instead of 237.","1413":"The RSV-associated disease burden among children in these 72 countries is estimated at an average of 20.8 million cases, 1.8 million hospital admissions, 40 thousand deaths, 1.2 million discounted DALYs, and US$611 million discounted direct costs. Strategy 'mAb' is more effective due to its assumed longer duration of protection versus maternal vaccination, but it was also assumed to be more expensive. Given all parameterised uncertainty, the optimal strategy of choice tends to change for increasing willingness to pay (WTP) values per DALY averted from the current situation to maternal vaccination (at WTP\u2009>\u2009US$1000) to mAB (at WTP\u2009>\u2009US$3500). The age-specific proportions of cases that are hospitalised and\/or die cause most of the uncertainty in the choice of optimal strategy. Results are broadly similar across countries.Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) frequently causes acute lower respiratory infection in children under 5, representing a high burden in Gavi-eligible countries\u00a0(mostly low-income and lower-middle-income). Since multiple RSV interventions, including vaccines and monoclonal antibody (mAb) candidates, are under development, we aim to evaluate the key drivers of the cost-effectiveness of maternal vaccination and infant mAb for 72 Gavi countries.A static Multi-Country Model Application for RSV Cost-Effectiveness poLicy (MCMARCEL) was developed to follow RSV-related events monthly from birth until 5\u00a0years of age. MCMARCEL was parameterised using country- and age-specific demographic, epidemiological, and cost data. The interventions' level and duration of effectiveness were guided by the World Health Organization's preferred product characteristics and other literature. Maternal vaccination and mAb were assumed to require single-dose administration at prices assumed to align with other Gavi-subsidised technologies. The effectiveness and the prices of the interventions were simultaneously varied in extensive scenario analyses. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were the primary health outcomes for cost-effectiveness, integrated with probabilistic sensitivity analyses\u00a0and Expected Value of Partially Perfect Information analysis.Both the maternal and mAb strategies need to be competitively priced to be judged as relatively cost-effective. Information on the level and duration of protection is crucial, but also more and better disease burden evidence-especially on RSV-attributable hospitalisation and death rates-is needed to support policy choices when novel RSV products become available.","1414":"Infections with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum typically comprise multiple strains, especially in high-transmission areas where infectious mosquito bites occur frequently. However, little is known about the dynamics of mixed-strain infections, particularly whether strains sharing a host compete or grow independently. Competition between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains, if it occurs, could be a crucial determinant of the spread of resistance. We analysed 1341 P. falciparum infections in children from Angola, Ghana and Tanzania and found compelling evidence for competition in mixed-strain infections: overall parasite density did not increase with additional strains, and densities of individual chloroquine-sensitive (CQS) and chloroquine-resistant (CQR) strains were reduced in the presence of competitors. We also found that CQR strains exhibited low densities compared with CQS strains (in the absence of chloroquine), which may underlie observed declines of chloroquine resistance in many countries following retirement of chloroquine as a first-line therapy. Our observations support a key role for within-host competition in the evolution of drug-resistant malaria. Malaria control and resistance-management efforts in high-transmission regions may be significantly aided or hindered by the effects of competition in mixed-strain infections. Consideration of within-host dynamics may spur development of novel strategies to minimize resistance while maximizing the benefits of control measures. ","1415":"To date, there are few examples of implementation science studies that help guide climate-related health adaptation. Implementation science is the study of methods to promote the adoption and integration of evidence-based tools, interventions, and policies into practice to improve population health. These studies can provide the needed empirical evidence to prioritise and inform implementation of health adaptation efforts. This Personal View discusses five case studies that deployed disease early warning systems around the world. These cases studies illustrate challenges to deploying early warning systems and guide recommendations for implementation science approaches to enhance future research. We propose theory-informed approaches to understand multilevel barriers, design strategies to overcome those barriers, and analyse the ability of those strategies to advance the uptake and scale-up of climate-related health interventions. These findings build upon previous theoretical work by grounding implementation science recommendations and guidance in the context of real-world practice, as detailed in the case studies.","1416":"Factors significantly associated with public compared to private insurance respectively were: increased reports of indoor asthma triggers (cockroach 76% vs 23%; mold 40% vs 12%), reduced income (72% vs 27%), and housing insecurity (32% vs 0%). Participants with public insurance were more likely to experience conditions less conducive to social distancing compared to respondents with private insurance, such as remaining in NYC (92% vs 38%) and using public transportation (44% vs 4%); families with private insurance also had greater access to remote work (81% vs 8%). Families with public insurance were significantly more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 (48% vs 15%) but less likely to have gotten tested (76% vs 100%). Families with public insurance also reported greater challenges accessing office medical care and less access to telehealth, although not statistically significant (44% vs 19%; 68% vs 85%, respectively).Findings highlight disproportionate burdens of the pandemic, and how these disparities affect children with asthma in urban environments.COVID-19 disproportionately affects families of low socioeconomic status and may worsen health disparities that existed prior to the pandemic. Asthma is a common chronic disease in children exacerbated by environmental exposures.A cross-sectional survey was conducted to understand the impact of the initial stage of the pandemic on environmental and social conditions, along with access to care for children with asthma in New York City (NYC). Participants were recruited from a community-based organization in East Harlem and a nearby academic Pediatric Pulmonary clinic and categorized as having either public or private insurance (n\u2009=\u200951).","1417":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to closure of nearly all K-12 schools in the United States of America in March 2020. Although reopening K-12 schools for in-person schooling is desirable for many reasons, officials understand that risk reduction strategies and detection of cases are imperative in creating a safe return to school. Furthermore, consequences of reclosing recently opened schools are substantial and impact teachers, parents, and ultimately educational experiences in children. To address competing interests in meeting educational needs with public safety, we compare the impact of physical separation through school cohorts on SARS-CoV-2 infections against policies acting at the level of individual contacts within classrooms. Using an age-stratified Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed model, we explore influences of reduced class density, transmission mitigation, and viral detection on cumulative prevalence. We consider several scenarios over a 6-month period including (1) multiple rotating cohorts in which students cycle through in-person instruction on a weekly basis, (2) parallel cohorts with in-person and remote learning tracks, (3) the impact of a hypothetical testing program with ideal and imperfect detection, and (4) varying levels of aggregate transmission reduction. Our mathematical model predicts that reducing the number of contacts through cohorts produces a larger effect than diminishing transmission rates per contact. Specifically, the latter approach requires dramatic reduction in transmission rates in order to achieve a comparable effect in minimizing infections over time. Further, our model indicates that surveillance programs using less sensitive tests may be adequate in monitoring infections within a school community by both keeping infections low and allowing for a longer period of instruction. Lastly, we underscore the importance of factoring infection prevalence in deciding when a local outbreak of infection is serious enough to require reverting to remote learning.","1418":"Bacillus anthracis is a spore-forming, Gram-positive bacterium responsible for anthrax, an acute infection that most significantly affects grazing livestock and wild ungulates, but also poses a threat to human health. The geographic extent of B. anthracis is poorly understood, despite multi-decade research on anthrax epizootic and epidemic dynamics; many countries have limited or inadequate surveillance systems, even within known endemic regions. Here, we compile a global occurrence dataset of human, livestock and wildlife anthrax outbreaks. With these records, we use boosted regression trees to produce a map of the global distribution of B. anthracis as a proxy for anthrax risk. We estimate that 1.83 billion people (95% credible interval (CI): 0.59-4.16 billion) live within regions of anthrax risk, but most of that population faces little occupational exposure. More informatively, a global total of 63.8 million poor livestock keepers (95% CI: 17.5-168.6 million) and 1.1 billion livestock (95% CI: 0.4-2.3 billion) live within vulnerable regions. Human and livestock vulnerability are both concentrated in rural rainfed systems throughout arid and temperate land across Eurasia, Africa and North America. We conclude by mapping where anthrax risk could disrupt sensitive conservation efforts for wild ungulates that coincide with anthrax-prone landscapes.","1419":"We developed a microsimulation model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a homeless shelter and calibrated it to data from cross-sectional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) surveys conducted during COVID-19 outbreaks in five homeless shelters in three US cities from March 28 to April 10, 2020. We estimated the probability of averting a COVID-19 outbreak when an exposed individual is introduced into a representative homeless shelter of 250 residents and 50 staff over 30\u2009days under different infection control strategies, including daily symptom-based screening, twice-weekly PCR testing, and universal mask wearing.COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred in homeless shelters across the US, highlighting an urgent need to identify the most effective infection control strategy to prevent future outbreaks.) within the simulated shelter and increasing incidence in the local community.In high-risk homeless shelter environments and locations with high community incidence of COVID-19, even intensive infection control strategies (incorporating daily symptom screening, frequent PCR testing, and universal mask wearing) are unlikely to prevent outbreaks, suggesting a need for non-congregate housing arrangements for people experiencing homelessness. In lower-risk environments, combined interventions should be employed to reduce outbreak risk.","1420":"The current study sought to examine awareness of, willingness to use, and preferences for available and theoretical administration modalities for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and the association of anal sex roles with these concepts among a sample of men who have sex with men (MSM) in Paris, France. Broadcast advertisements were placed on a popular geosocial-networking smartphone application for MSM to direct users to complete a Web-based survey. MSM answered questions on their recent engagement in condomless anal intercourse and awareness of and willingness to use PrEP in the form of once daily and event-driven pill regimens, long-acting injections, and penile and rectal microbicides as well as sexual roles. Multinomial regression models were fit to assess the association between behaviorally classified anal sexual role and preferences for one of these biomedical prevention modalities. A total of 482 HIV-uninfected MSM completed the survey, 48.1% of whom engaged in some form of condomless anal intercourse in the preceding 3\u00a0months. Most respondents (85.3%) had heard of once daily PrEP, but fewer respondents had heard of other prevention strategies. Assuming equal effectiveness, long-acting injections were the most commonly preferred (21.8%). Behaviorally defined \"bottom\" and \"versatile\" MSM more frequently preferred long-acting injections (32.9% of \"bottoms\" and 25.3% of \"versatiles\"). The development of long-acting injections to deliver antiretroviral drugs and topical microbicides may offer more convenient and acceptable options for HIV prevention among MSM, as MSM in this sample were willing to use them and would prefer to use them over currently available pill regimens.","1421":"The information implicitly represented in the state of physical systems allows for their analysis using analytical techniques from statistical mechanics and information theory. This approach has been successfully applied to complex networks, including biophysical systems such as virus-host protein-protein interactions and whole-brain models in health and disease, drawing inspiration from quantum statistical physics. Here we propose a general mathematical framework for modeling information dynamics on complex networks, where the internal node states are vector valued, allowing each node to carry multiple types of information. This setup is relevant for various biophysical and sociotechnological models of complex systems, ranging from viral dynamics on networks to models of opinion dynamics and social contagion. Instead of focusing on node-node interactions, we shift our attention to the flow of information between network configurations. We uncover fundamental differences between widely used spin models on networks, such as voter and kinetic dynamics, which cannot be detected through classical node-based analysis. We illustrate the mathematical framework further through an exemplary application to epidemic spreading on a low-dimensional network. Our model provides an opportunity to adapt powerful analytical methods from quantum many-body systems to study the interplay between structure and dynamics in interconnected systems.","1422":" < 0.001).

Cumulative risk over 25 years from new infection was 7.9% (7.0, 8.9). In 2020, an estimated average age of individuals with prevalent infection was 62 (61, 63) for the US-born population, 55 (54, 55) for non-US-born, and 57 (56, 58) overall. Average risks of developing TB over the remaining lifetime were 1.2% (1.0, 1.4) for US-born, 2.2% (1.8, 2.6) for non-US-born, and 1.9% (1.6, 2.2) for the general population.

In the United States, most TB cases result from the progression of latent TB infection acquired over 2 years ago.Our analysis suggests that, although newly infected individuals face appreciable lifetime TB risks, most US individuals with latent TB infection were infected long ago, and face low future risks of developing TB. Better approaches are needed for identifying recently infected individuals and those with elevated progression risks.We synthesized evidence on TB natural history and incidence trends using a transmission-dynamic model. For the 2020 US population, we estimated average time since infection and annual, cumulative, and remaining lifetime risks of progression to TB, by nativity and age.","1424":"Connecting patients to community-based resources is now a cornerstone of modern healthcare that supports self-management of health.

Modeling studies for regional Leishmania elimination indicate that an effective vaccine is a critical tool. Dogs are the reservoir host of L. infantum in Brazil and the Mediterranean basin, and therefore are an important target for public health interventions as well as a relevant disease model for human VL. No vaccine has been efficacious as an immunotherapy to prevent progression of already diagnostically positive individuals to symptomatic leishmaniasis. We performed a double-blinded, block-randomized, placebo-controlled, vaccine immunotherapy trial testing the efficacy of a recombinant Leishmania A2 protein, saponin-adjuvanted, vaccine, LeishTec\u00ae, in owned hunting dogs infected with L. infantum. The primary outcome was reduction of clinical progression, with reduction of mortality as a secondary outcome. Vaccination as an immunotherapy reduced the risk of progression to clinically overt leishmaniasis by 25% in asymptomatic dogs (RR: 1.33 95% C.I. 1.009-1.786 p-value: 0.0450).

We find strong evidence of an important sylvatic cycle for MAYV with most infections occurring near the natural reservoir in rural areas and in individuals more likely to go to the forest (i.e., adult males) and with seroprevalences of up to 18% in some areas. These findings highlight the need to strengthen MAYV surveillance in the region and showcase how modeling can improve interpretation of cross-reacting assays.","1427":"Canine distemper is a high-impact disease of many mammal species and has caused substantial carnivore population declines. Analysis was conducted on passive surveillance data of canine distemper (CDV)-positive wild mammal cases submitted to the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study, Athens, Georgia, US, between January 1975 and December 2019. Overall, 964 cases from 17 states were CDV positive, including 646 raccoons (Procyon lotor, 254 gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus, 33 striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), 18 coyotes (Canis latrans), four red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), three gray wolves (Canis lupus), three American black bears (Ursus americanus), two American mink (Mustela vison), and one long-tailed weasel (Mustela frenata). Raccoon and gray fox case data from the state of Georgia (n=441) were selected for further analysis. Autoregressive integrated moving average models were developed predicting raccoon and gray fox case numbers. The best-performing model for gray foxes used numbers of gray fox CDV cases from the previous 2 mo and of raccoon cases in the present month to predict the numbers of gray fox cases in the present month. The best-performing model for raccoon prediction used numbers of raccoon CDV cases from the previous month and of gray fox cases in the present month and previous 2 mo to predict numbers of raccoon cases in the present month. Temporal trends existed in CDV cases for both species, with cases more likely to occur during the breeding season. Spatial clustering of cases was more likely to occur in areas of medium to high human population density; fewer cases occurred in both the most densely populated and sparsely populated areas. This pattern was most prominent for raccoons, which may correspond to high transmission rates in suburban areas, where raccoon population densities are probably highest, possibly because of a combination of suitable habitat and supplemental resources.","1428":"Although the environment varies, adaptive trait plasticity is uncommon, which can be due to either costs or limitations. Currently there is little evidence for costs of plasticity; limitations are a more promising explanation, including information reliability. A possible cause for a decrease in information reliability is the channeling of environmental information through one trait that then affects the phenotype of a second trait, the information path. Using an individual-based simulation model, I explored the ways in which configurations of trait interactions and patterns of environmental variation in space and time affect the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. I found that genotypes and phenotypes evolved to shorten and simplify the information path from the environment to fitness. A shortened path was characterized by a decrease in the amount of plasticity for traits that had a less direct connection between the environment of development and fitness. A simplified path was characterized by a decrease in the amount of plasticity for traits that had multiple paths between the environment and their phenotype. These results suggest that an eighth proposition be added to the theory of the evolution of phenotypic plasticity: Trait plasticity will evolve to minimize the information path between the environment and fitness.","1429":"Automated function prediction (AFP) of proteins is of great significance in biology. AFP can be regarded as a problem of the large-scale multi-label classification where a protein can be associated with multiple gene ontology terms as its labels. Based on our GOLabeler-a state-of-the-art method for the third critical assessment of functional annotation (CAFA3), in this paper we propose NetGO, a web server that is able to further improve the performance of the large-scale AFP by incorporating massive protein-protein network information. Specifically, the advantages of NetGO are threefold in using network information: (i) NetGO relies on a powerful learning to rank framework from machine learning to effectively integrate both sequence and network information of proteins; (ii) NetGO uses the massive network information of all species (>2000) in STRING (other than only some specific species) and (iii) NetGO still can use network information to annotate a protein by homology transfer, even if it is not contained in STRING. Separating training and testing data with the same time-delayed settings of CAFA, we comprehensively examined the performance of NetGO. Experimental results have clearly demonstrated that NetGO significantly outperforms GOLabeler and other competing methods. The NetGO web server is freely available at http:\/\/issubmission.sjtu.edu.cn\/netgo\/.","1430":"Accurate forecasts can enable more effective public health responses during seasonal influenza epidemics. Forecasting teams were asked to provide national and jurisdiction-specific probabilistic predictions of weekly confirmed influenza hospital admissions for one through four weeks ahead for the 2021-22 and 2022-23 influenza seasons. Across both seasons, 26 teams submitted forecasts, with the submitting teams varying between seasons. Forecast skill was evaluated using the Weighted Interval Score (WIS), relative WIS, and coverage. Six out of 23 models outperformed the baseline model across forecast weeks and locations in 2021-22 and 12 out of 18 models in 2022-23. Averaging across all forecast targets, the FluSight ensemble was the 2nd most accurate model measured by WIS in 2021-22 and the 5th most accurate in the 2022-23 season. Forecast skill and 95% coverage for the FluSight ensemble and most component models degraded over longer forecast horizons and during periods of rapid change. Current influenza forecasting efforts help inform situational awareness, but research is needed to address limitations, including decreased performance during periods of changing epidemic dynamics.","1431":"Left unabated, climate change will have catastrophic effects on the health of present and future generations. Such effects are already seen in Europe, through more frequent and severe extreme weather events, alterations to water and food systems, and changes in the environmental suitability for infectious diseases. As one of the largest current and historical contributors to greenhouse gases and the largest provider of financing for climate change mitigation and adaptation, Europe's response is crucial, for both human health and the planet. To ensure that health and wellbeing are protected in this response it is essential to build the capacity to understand, monitor, and quantify health impacts of climate change and the health co-benefits of accelerated action. Responding to this need, the Lancet Countdown in Europe is established as a transdisciplinary research collaboration for monitoring progress on health and climate change in Europe. With the wealth of data and academic expertise available in Europe, the collaboration will develop region-specific indicators to address the main challenges and opportunities of Europe's response to climate change for health. The indicators produced by the collaboration will provide information to health and climate policy decision making, and will also contribute to the European Observatory on Climate and Health.","1432":"Homeless shelter residents and staff may be at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, SARS-CoV-2 infection estimates in this population have been reliant on cross-sectional or outbreak investigation data. We conducted routine surveillance and outbreak testing in 23 homeless shelters in King County, Washington, to estimate the occurrence of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and risk factors during 1 January 2020-31 May 2021. Symptom surveys and nasal swabs were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing by RT-PCR for residents aged \u22653\u00a0months and staff. We collected 12,915 specimens from 2,930 unique participants. We identified 4.74 (95% CI 4.00-5.58) SARS-CoV-2 infections per 100 individuals (residents: 4.96, 95% CI 4.12-5.91; staff: 3.86, 95% CI 2.43-5.79). Most infections were asymptomatic at the time of detection (74%) and detected during routine surveillance (73%). Outbreak testing yielded higher test positivity than routine surveillance (2.7% versus 0.9%). Among those infected, residents were less likely to report symptoms than staff. Participants who were vaccinated against seasonal influenza and were current smokers had lower odds of having an infection detected. Active surveillance that includes SARS-CoV-2 testing of all persons is essential in ascertaining the true burden of SARS-CoV-2 infections among residents and staff of congregate settings.","1433":"The personal information campaign significantly increased vaccination initiation, with older girls reacting faster. One year after the campaign the percentages of vaccination initiation for the oldest girls were 64.6 and 42.8 % in the intervention and control group, respectively (z = 3.35, p = 0.0008); for the youngest girls the percentages were 78.4 and 68.1 % (z = 1.71, p = 0.09). The combined personal information and financial incentive campaign increased vaccination initiation among certain age groups. One year after the campaign the difference in percentage points for HPV vaccination initiation between intervention and control groups varied between 18.5 % (z = 3.65, p = 0.0002) and 5.1 % (z = 1.12, p = 0.26).Adolescent vaccination coverage under a system of non school-based vaccination is likely to be suboptimal, but might be increased by targeted encouragement campaigns. We analysed the effect on human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination initiation by girls aged 12-18 of two campaigns set up in Flanders (Belgium) in 2007 and 2009: a personal information campaign and a combined personal information and financial incentive campaign.Under a non school-based vaccination system, personal information and removing out-of-pocket costs had a significant positive effect on HPV vaccination initiation, although the effect substantially varied in magnitude. Overall, the obtained vaccination rates remained far below those realised under school-based HPV vaccination.We analysed (objective) data on HPV vaccination behaviour from the National Alliance of Christian Mutualities (NACM), Flanders' largest sickness fund. We used z-scores to compare the monthly proportion of girls initiating HPV vaccination over time between carefully selected intervention and control groups. Separate analyses were done for older and younger girls. Total sample sizes of the intervention (control) groups were 221 (243) for the personal information campaign and 629 (5,322) for the combined personal information and financial incentive campaign.","1434":"Antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) are being developed as therapeutics and are a major contributor to neutralizing antibody responses elicited by infection. Here, we describe a deep mutational scanning method to map how all amino-acid mutations in the RBD affect antibody binding and apply this method to 10 human monoclonal antibodies. The escape mutations cluster on several surfaces of the RBD that broadly correspond to structurally defined antibody epitopes. However, even antibodies targeting the same surface often have distinct escape mutations. The complete escape maps predict which mutations are selected during viral growth in the presence of single antibodies. They further enable the design of escape-resistant antibody cocktails-including cocktails of antibodies that compete for binding to the same RBD surface but have different escape mutations. Therefore, complete escape-mutation maps enable rational design of antibody therapeutics and assessment of the antigenic consequences of viral evolution.","1435":"Augmenting existing publicly accessible AEDs with AEDs deployed at PCBs can increase AED spatial coverage in both residential and non-residential areas, and reduce the distance from AED to OHCA.We hypothesized that PCB-AEDs would increase AED coverage overall and in residential areas, and reduce the distance from OHCA to an AED.Optimizing placement of Automated External Defibrillators (AED) can increase survival after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Using postal collection boxes (PCB) as locations for AEDs could potentially enhance accessibility and streamline maintenance. In this study, we modeled the hypothetical effects of deploying AEDs at PCB locations.AEDs in Pittsburgh, PA were identified by the University of Pittsburgh Resuscitation Logistics and Informatics Venture (n=747). PCB locations were obtained from the United States Postal Service (n=479). OHCA locations from 2009 to 2014 were obtained from the Pittsburgh site of the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium. AED coverage assuming a \u00bc mile radius around each AED was estimated for known AEDs, PCB-AEDs (hypothetical AED locations), and known AEDs augmented by PCB-AEDs, both overall and for residential and non-residential zones. Linear distance from each OHCA to the nearest AED was calculated and compared between the sets.The set of known AEDs augmented with PCB-AEDs covered more of the city overall (55% vs 30%), as well as greater proportions of residential (62% vs 27%) and non-residential areas (45% vs 30%). The median distance from OHCA to AED was significantly shorter when known AEDs were augmented with PCB-AEDs (0.12mi vs 0.32mi; p=0.001).","1436":"The study of fitness landscapes, which aims at mapping genotypes to fitness, is receiving ever-increasing attention. Novel experimental approaches combined with next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods enable accurate and extensive studies of the fitness effects of mutations, allowing us to test theoretical predictions and improve our understanding of the shape of the true underlying fitness landscape and its implications for the predictability and repeatability of evolution. Here, we present a uniquely large multiallelic fitness landscape comprising 640 engineered mutants that represent all possible combinations of 13 amino acid-changing mutations at 6 sites in the heat-shock protein Hsp90 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under elevated salinity. Despite a prevalent pattern of negative epistasis in the landscape, we find that the global fitness peak is reached via four positively epistatic mutations. Combining traditional and extending recently proposed theoretical and statistical approaches, we quantify features of the global multiallelic fitness landscape. Using subsets of the data, we demonstrate that extrapolation beyond a known part of the landscape is difficult owing to both local ruggedness and amino acid-specific epistatic hotspots and that inference is additionally confounded by the nonrandom choice of mutations for experimental fitness landscapes.","1437":"This paper introduces a new method for acquiring and interpreting data on cognitive (or perceptual) networks. The proposed method involves the collection of multiple reports on randomly chosen pairs of individuals, and statistical means for aggregating these reports into data of conventional sociometric form. We refer to the method as \"perceptual tomography\" to emphasize that it aggregates multiple 3rd-party data on the perceived presence or absence of individual properties and pairwise relationships. Key features of the method include its low respondent burden, flexible interpretation, as well as its ability to find \"robust intransitive\" ties in the form of perceived non-edges. This latter feature, in turn, allows for the application of conventional balance clustering routines to perceptual tomography data. In what follows, we will describe both the method and an example of the implementation of the method from a recent community study among Alaska Natives. Interview data from 170 community residents is used to ascribe 4446 perceived relationships (2146 perceived edges, 2300 perceived non-edges) among 393 community members, and to assert the perceived presence (or absence) of 16 community-oriented helping behaviors to each individual in the community. Using balance theory-based partitioning of the perceptual network, we show that people in the community perceive distinct helping roles as structural associations among community members. The fact that role classes can be detected in network renderings of \"tomographic\" perceptual information lends support to the suggestion that this method is capable of producing meaningful new kinds of data about perceptual networks.","1438":"There is an emerging consensus that achieving global tuberculosis control targets will require more proactive case finding approaches than are currently used in high-incidence settings. Household contact tracing (HHCT), for which households of newly diagnosed cases are actively screened for additional infected individuals is a potentially efficient approach to finding new cases of tuberculosis, however randomized trials assessing the population-level effects of such interventions in settings with sustained community transmission have shown mixed results. One potential explanation for this is that household transmission is responsible for a variable proportion of population-level tuberculosis burden between settings. For example, transmission is more likely to occur in households in settings with a lower tuberculosis burden and where individuals mix preferentially in local areas, compared with settings with higher disease burden and more dispersed mixing. To better understand the relationship between endemic incidence levels, social mixing, and the impact of HHCT, we developed a spatially explicit model of coupled household and community transmission. We found that the impact of HHCT was robust across settings of varied incidence and community contact patterns. In contrast, we found that the effects of community contact tracing interventions were sensitive to community contact patterns. Our results suggest that the protective benefits of HHCT are robust and the benefits of this intervention are likely to be maintained across epidemiological settings.","1439":"Stepped wedge cluster randomized trials are increasingly being used to evaluate interventions in medical, public health, educational, and social science contexts. With the longitudinal and crossover nature of a SW-CRT, complex analysis techniques are often needed which makes appropriately powering SW-CRTs challenging. In this paper, we introduce a newly-developed SW-CRT power calculator, embedded within the power command in Stata. The power calculator assumes a marginal model (i.e., generalized estimating equations [GEE]) for the primary analysis of SW-CRTs, for which other currently available SW-CRT power calculators may not be suitable. The program accommodates complete cross-sectional and closed-cohort designs, and includes multilevel correlation structures appropriate for such designs. We discuss the methods and formulae underlying our SW-CRT calculator, and provide illustrative examples of the use of power swgee. We provide suggestions about the choice of parameters in power swgee, and conclude by discussing areas of future research which may improve the program.","1440":"The independent emergence late in 2020 of the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 lineages of SARS-CoV-2 prompted renewed concerns about the evolutionary capacity of this virus to overcome public health interventions and rising population immunity. Here, by examining patterns of synonymous and non-synonymous mutations that have accumulated in SARS-CoV-2 genomes since the pandemic began, we find that the emergence of these three \"501Y lineages\" coincided with a major global shift in the selective forces acting on various SARS-CoV-2 genes. Following their emergence, the adaptive evolution of 501Y lineage viruses has involved repeated selectively favored convergent mutations at 35 genome sites, mutations we refer to as the 501Y meta-signature. The ongoing convergence of viruses in many other lineages on this meta-signature suggests that it includes multiple mutation combinations capable of promoting the persistence of diverse SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the face of mounting host immune recognition.","1441":"We show that An. stephensi is genetically diverse in Ethiopia and with evidence of geographical structure. Variation in the level of diversity supports the hypothesis for a more recent introduction of An. stephensi into southeastern Ethiopia relative to the northeastern region. We also find evidence that supports the hypothesis that HOA An. stephensi populations originate from South Asia rather than the Arabian Peninsula. The evidence of both zoophagic and anthropophagic feeding support the need for additional investigation into the potential for livestock movement to play a role in vector spread in this region.We sequenced the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and cytochrome B gene (CytB) in 187 An. stephensi collected from 10 sites in Ethiopia in 2018. Population genetic, phylogenetic, and minimum spanning network analyses were conducted for Ethiopian sequences. Molecular identification of blood meal sources was also performed using universal vertebrate CytB sequencing.The recent detection of the South Asian malaria vector Anopheles stephensi in the Horn of Africa (HOA) raises concerns about the impact of this mosquito on malaria transmission in the region. Analysis of An. stephensi genetic diversity and population structure can provide insight into the history of the mosquito in the HOA to improve predictions of future spread. We investigated the genetic diversity of An. stephensi in eastern Ethiopia, where detection suggests a range expansion into this region, in order to understand the history of this invasive population.Six An. stephensi COI-CytB haplotypes were observed, with the highest number of haplotypes in the northeastern sites (Semera, Bati, and Gewana towns) relative to the southeastern sites (Kebridehar, Godey, and Degehabur) in eastern Ethiopia. We observed population differentiation, with the highest differentiation between the northeastern sites compared to central sites (Erer Gota, Dire Dawa, and Awash Sebat Kilo) and the southeastern sites. Phylogenetic and network analysis revealed that the HOA An. stephensi are more genetically similar to An. stephensi from southern Asia than from the Arabian Peninsula. Finally, molecular blood meal analysis revealed evidence of feeding on cows, goats, dogs, and humans, as well as evidence of multiple (mixed) blood meals.","1442":"The number of inpatients with norovirus-associated gastroenteritis in England was modeled using infectious and noninfectious gastrointestinal Hospital Episode Statistics codes and laboratory reports of gastrointestinal pathogens collected at Public Health England. The excess length of stay from norovirus was estimated with a multistate model and local outbreak data. Unoccupied bed-days and staff absences were estimated from national outbreak surveillance. The burden was valued conventionally using accounting expenditures and wages, which we contrasted to the opportunity costs from forgone patients using a novel methodology.In England, norovirus is now the second-largest contributor of the gastrointestinal hospital burden. With the projected impact being greater than previously estimated, improved capture of relevant opportunity costs seems imperative for diseases such as norovirus.Between July 2013 and June 2016, 17.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.6%\u201221.6%) of primary and 23.8% (95% CI, 20.6%\u201229.9%) of secondary gastrointestinal diagnoses were norovirus attributable. Annually, the estimated median 290000 (interquartile range, 282000\u2012297000) occupied and unoccupied bed-days used for norovirus displaced 57800 patients. Conventional costs for the National Health Service reached \u00a3107.6 million; the economic burden approximated to \u00a3297.7 million and a loss of 6300 quality-adjusted life-years annually.Norovirus places a substantial burden on healthcare systems, arising from infected patients, disease outbreaks, beds kept unoccupied for infection control, and staff absences due to infection. In settings with high rates of bed occupancy, opportunity costs arise from patients who cannot be admitted due to beds being unavailable. With several treatments and vaccines against norovirus in development, quantifying the expected economic burden is timely.","1443":"This article reflects on the potential value and many pitfalls of underpowered studies to help authors and readers consider whether and how they contribute meaningfully to the published literature. A basic introduction to power and sample size calculations is provided. Several problems that can arise in analysis and publication of underpowered studies are described. In addition, features of underpowered studies that may provide value are proposed, including when the hypothesis test of interest is a limited part of the story, the data is rich enough to showcase interesting features of the population of interest, when the rarity or ubiquity of events is an important finding, and when the study is preregistered to reduce the impact of publication bias. Several reporting guidelines for underpowered studies are also suggested.","1444":"In Uganda, the implementation of a dedicated pediatric OR has an ICER of $37.25 per disability adjusted life year averted or $3321 per life saved, compared with no existing operating room. The ICER is well below multiple cost-effectiveness thresholds including one times the country's gross domestic product per capita ($694). The ICER remained robust under 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.To determine the cost-effectiveness of building and maintaining a dedicated pediatric operating room (OR) in Uganda from the societal perspective.In this economic model, we used a decision tree template to compare the intervention of a dedicated pediatric OR in Uganda for a year versus the absence of a pediatric OR. Costs were included from the government, charity, and patient perspectives. OR and ward case-log informed epidemiological and patient outcomes data, and measured cost per disability adjusted life year averted and cost per life saved. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated between the intervention and counterfactual scenario. Costs are reported in 2015 US$ and inflated by 5.5%.Despite the heavy burden of pediatric surgical disease in low-income countries, definitive treatment is limited as surgical infrastructure is inadequate to meet the need, leading to preventable morbidity and mortality in children.Our model ICER suggests that the construction and maintenance of a dedicated pediatric operating room in sub-Saharan Africa is very-cost effective if hospital space and personnel pre-exist to staff the facility. This supports infrastructure implementation for surgery in sub-Saharan Africa as a worthwhile investment.","1445":"Multiple-merger coalescents, also known as \u039b-coalescents, have been used to describe the genealogy of populations that have a skewed offspring distribution or that undergo strong selection. Inferring the characteristic measure \u039b, which describes the rates of the multiple-merger events, is key to understand these processes. So far, most inference methods only work for some particular families of \u039b-coalescents that are described by only one parameter, but not for more general models. This article is devoted to the construction of a non-parametric estimator of the density of \u039b that is based on the observation at a single time of the so-called Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS), which describes the allelic frequencies in a present population sample. First, we produce estimates of the multiple-merger rates by solving a linear system, whose coefficients are obtained by appropriately subsampling the SFS. Then, we use a technique that aggregates the information extracted from the previous step through a kernel type of re-construction to give a non-parametric estimation of the measure \u039b. We give a consistency result of this estimator under mild conditions on the behavior of \u039b around 0. We also show some numerical examples of how our method performs.","1446":"This study aimed to characterize the prevalence of irritability among U.S. adults, and the extent to which it co-occurs with major depressive and anxious symptoms. A non-probability internet survey of individuals 18 and older in 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia was conducted between November 2, 2023, and January 8, 2024. Regression models with survey weighting were used to examine associations between the Brief Irritability Test (BITe5) and sociodemographic and clinical features. The survey cohort included 42,739 individuals, mean age 46.0 (SD 17.0) years; 25,001 (58.5%) identified as women, 17,281 (40.4%) as men, and 457 (1.1%) as nonbinary. A total of 1218(2.8%) identified as Asian American, 5971 (14.0%) as Black, 5348 (12.5%) as Hispanic, 1775 (4.2%) as another race, and 28,427 (66.5%) as white. Mean irritability score was 13.6 (SD 5.6) on a scale from 5 to 30. In linear regression models, irritability was greater among respondents who were female, younger, had lower levels of education, and lower household income. Greater irritability was associated with likelihood of thoughts of suicide in logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic features (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.22-1.24). Among 1979 individuals without thoughts of suicide on the initial survey assessed for such thoughts on a subsequent survey, greater irritability was also associated with greater likelihood of thoughts of suicide being present (adjusted OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.12-1.23). The prevalence of irritability and its association with thoughts of suicide suggests the need to better understand its implications among adults outside of acute mood episodes.","1447":"The enforcement of the GDPR in May 2018 has led to a paradigm shift in data protection. Organizations face significant challenges, such as demonstrating compliance (or auditability) and automated compliance verification due to the complex and dynamic nature of consent, as well as the scale at which compliance verification must be performed. Furthermore, the GDPR's promotion of data protection by design and industrial interoperability requirements has created new technical challenges, as they require significant changes in the design and implementation of systems that handle personal data. We present a scalable data protection by design tool for automated compliance verification and auditability based on informed consent that is modeled with a knowledge graph. Automated compliance verification is made possible by implementing a regulation-to-code process that translates GDPR regulations into well-defined technical and organizational measures and, ultimately, software code. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the tool in the insurance and smart cities domains. We highlight ways in which our tool can be adapted to other domains.","1448":"The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated that emerging variants can set back the global COVID-19 response. The ability to rapidly assess the threat of new variants is critical for timely optimisation of control strategies. We present a novel method to estimate the effective transmission advantage of a new variant compared to a reference variant combining information across multiple locations and over time. Through an extensive simulation study designed to mimic real-time epidemic contexts, we show that our method performs well across a range of scenarios and provide guidance on its optimal use and interpretation of results. We also provide an open-source software implementation of our method. The computational speed of our tool enables users to rapidly explore spatial and temporal variations in the estimated transmission advantage. We estimate that the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant is 1.46 (95% Credible Interval 1.44-1.47) and 1.29 (95% CrI 1.29-1.30) times more transmissible than the wild type, using data from England and France respectively. We further estimate that Delta is 1.77 (95% CrI 1.69-1.85) times more transmissible than Alpha (England data). Our approach can be used as an important first step towards quantifying the threat of emerging or co-circulating variants of infectious pathogens in real-time.","1449":"N\/a.","1450":"Pediatric programs focused on treating chronic pain often do not include an educational liaison (EL) to coordinate services between the patient's medical home and school. As chronic pain in youth can have deleterious effects on school functioning, collaboration between the medical home and the school system are needed to assure these students receive appropriate accommodations.This manuscript describes a model of coordinated care for students with chronic pain that includes a systemic strategy for collaborative care across settings. Specifically, the role of an EL is described in the context of advocating for the patient to receive appropriate educational accommodations.This paper provides a guide for caregivers and professionals to assure appropriate access to support services across settings. Recommendations are included for school accommodations and services to improve academic functioning and outcomes for students with chronic pain.","1451":"This research introduced an extensive mathematical model to capture the dynamics of diphtheria transmission. The study examined the interaction of five control measures viz: routine diphtheria vaccination, often administered with tetanus and pertussis vaccines; interventions for symptomatic to isolated treatment transitions; collaborative efforts addressing asymptomatic to home quarantine transitions; surveillance measures for home quarantine to isolated treatment transitions; and vigilance to detect cases in individuals exposed to symptomatic cases. We established the epidemiological viability of the model by proving, among others, its positivity, equilibrium under endemic conditions, equilibrium in the absence of disease, global and local stability and boundedness. Also the sensitivity analysis of the model highlighted the importance of the important variables in influencing disease occurrence and spread. In addition, the control measures significantly impact virus transmission dynamics, and results from simulations demonstrated that combination of these control strategies effectively flattened the curve of diphtheria transmission. These findings provided healthcare professionals and policymakers with valuable insights into crucial measures for eradicating diphtheria from the population.","1452":"Influenza vaccination is an important intervention to prevent influenza virus infection. Our previous analysis suggested that indirect protection is limited in an influenza B epidemic in Hong Kong. We further analyzed six influenza A epidemics to determine such potential. We applied a statistical model to estimate household transmission dynamics in the 3 influenza A(H3N2) and 3 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) epidemics. Then, we estimated the reduction in infection risk among unvaccinated household members when all children in households are vaccinated, with different assumptions on vaccine efficacy (VE). In the optimal scenario that VE was 70%, the reduction to the total probability of infection was only marginal, with relative probabilities ranged from 0.91-0.94 when all children in households were vaccinated because community was by far the main source of infection during the six epidemics in our study. The proportion of cases attributed to household transmission was 10% (95% CrI: 7%, 13%). Individual influenza vaccination is important even when other household members are vaccinated, given the degree of indirect protection is small.","1453":"Fewer PUIs underwent repeat testing after an initial negative NAAT post-CORAL than pre-CORAL (54% vs. 67%; aOR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.44-0.63, p<0.01). CORAL significantly reduced average time to PUI status discontinuation (adjusted difference: -7.4 [SE 0.8] hours\/patient; p<0.01), total duration of PUI status (adjusted difference: -19.5 [SE 1.9] hours\/patient; p<0.01), and average ID physician work-hours (adjusted difference: -57.4 [SE 2.0] hours\/day; p<0.01). No patients had a positive NAAT within 7 days after discontinuation of precautions via CORAL.We conducted a pre-post study of CORAL (COvid Risk cALculator), a CDSS that guides frontline clinicians through a risk-stratified COVID-19 diagnostic workup, removes transmission-based precautions when workup is complete and negative, and triages complex cases to Infectious Diseases (ID) physician review. Pre-CORAL, ID physicians reviewed all PUI records to guide workup and precautions. Post-CORAL, frontline clinicians evaluated PUIs directly using CORAL. We compared pre- and post-CORAL frequency of repeat SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), time from NAAT result to PUI status discontinuation, total duration of PUI status, and ID physician work-hours, using linear and logistic regression, adjusted for COVID-19 incidence.Isolation of hospitalized persons under investigation (PUIs) for COVID-19 reduces nosocomial transmission risk. Efficient PUI evaluation is needed to preserve scarce healthcare resources. We describe the development, implementation, and outcomes of an inpatient diagnostic algorithm and clinical decision support system (CDSS) to evaluate PUIs.CORAL is an efficient and effective CDSS to guide frontline clinicians through the diagnostic evaluation of PUIs and safe discontinuation of precautions.","1454":" mosquitoes, such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya, have expanding ranges and seem unabated by current vector control programs. Effective control of these pathogens likely requires integrated approaches. We evaluated dengue management options in an endemic setting that combine novel vector control and vaccination using an agent-based model for Yucat\u00e1n, Mexico, fit to 37 y of data. Our intervention models are informed by targeted indoor residual spraying (TIRS) experiments; trial outcomes and World Health Organization (WHO) testing guidance for the only licensed dengue vaccine, CYD-TDV; and preliminary results for in-development vaccines. We evaluated several implementation options, including varying coverage levels; staggered introductions; and a one-time, large-scale vaccination campaign. We found that CYD-TDV and TIRS interfere: while the combination outperforms either alone, performance is lower than estimated from their separate benefits. The conventional model hypothesized for in-development vaccines, however, performs synergistically with TIRS, amplifying effectiveness well beyond their independent impacts. If the preliminary performance by either of the in-development vaccines is upheld, a one-time, large-scale campaign followed by routine vaccination alongside aggressive new vector control could enable short-term elimination, with nearly all cases avoided for a decade despite continuous dengue reintroductions. If elimination is impracticable due to resource limitations, less ambitious implementations of this combination still produce amplified, longer-lasting effectiveness over single-approach interventions.","1455":"There is limited evidence on the impact of the use of progestin-only hormonal contraception (POC) on weight change. We conducted a secondary analysis of prospective weight change among women enrolled in the Evidence for Contraceptive options and HIV Outcomes (ECHO) trial.We found differences in weight gain between POC users compared to the non-hormonal copper IUD group over 12-18 months of use. Women using POCs should be counselled about this potential side effect when choosing a contraceptive method.The ECHO trial was conducted at 12 sites in eSwatini, Kenya, South Africa and Zambia between December 2015 and October 2018. HIV negative, women aged 16-35 years, desiring contraception, were randomised (1:1:1) to either 3-monthly intramuscular depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-IM), levonorgestrel (LNG) implant or copper intrauterine device (IUD). Follow-up was up to 18 months. Weight (kg) was measured at baseline and study exit. Analysis was performed as intention to treat (ITT) and time on continuous contraceptive use. The primary outcome of this secondary analysis is weight change from study enrolment to the final visit at study month 12-18. The ECHO trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02550067.\u00a0<\u00a00.001) for DMPA-IM compared with LNG implant. Results for continuous contraceptive use were similar.","1456":"Ecological associations between hosts and parasites are influenced by host exposure and susceptibility to parasites, and by parasite traits, such as transmission mode. Advances in network analysis allow us to answer questions about the causes and consequences of traits in ecological networks in ways that could not be addressed in the past. We used a network-based framework (exponential random graph models or ERGMs) to investigate the biogeographic, phylogenetic and ecological characteristics of hosts and parasites that affect the probability of interactions among nonhuman primates and their parasites. Parasites included arthropods, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, viruses and helminths. We investigated existing hypotheses, along with new predictors and an expanded host-parasite database that included 213 primate nodes, 763 parasite nodes and 2319 edges among them. Analyses also investigated phylogenetic relatedness, sampling effort and spatial overlap among hosts. In addition to supporting some previous findings, our ERGM approach demonstrated that more threatened hosts had fewer parasites, and notably, that this effect was independent of hosts also having a smaller geographic range. Despite having fewer parasites, threatened host species shared more parasites with other hosts, consistent with loss of specialist parasites and threat arising from generalist parasites that can be maintained in other, non-threatened hosts. Viruses, protozoa and helminths had broader host ranges than bacteria, or fungi, and parasites that infect non-primates had a higher probability of infecting more primate species. The value of the ERGM approach for investigating the processes structing host-parasite networks provided a more complete view on the biogeographic, phylogenetic and ecological traits that influence parasite species richness and parasite sharing among hosts. The results supported some previous analyses and revealed new associations that warrant future research, thus revealing how hosts and parasites interact to form ecological networks.","1457":"While large datasets of HIV-1 sequences are increasingly being generated, many studies rely on a single gene or fragment of the genome and few comparative studies across genes have been done. We performed genome-based and gene-specific Bayesian phylogenetic analyses to investigate how certain factors impact estimates of the infection dates in an acute HIV-1 infection cohort, RV217. In this cohort, HIV-1 diagnosis corresponded to the first RNA positive test and occurred a median of four days after the last negative test, allowing us to compare timing estimates using BEAST to a narrow window of infection. We analyzed HIV-1 sequences sampled one week, one month and six months after HIV-1 diagnosis in 39 individuals. We found that shared diversity and temporal signal was limited in acute infection, and insufficient to allow timing inferences in the shortest HIV-1 genes, thus dated phylogenies were primarily analyzed for env, gag, pol and near full-length genomes. There was no one best fitting model across participants and genes, though relaxed molecular clocks (73% of best fitting models) and the Bayesian skyline (49%) tended to be favored. For infections with single founders, the infection date was estimated to be around one week pre-diagnosis for env (IQR: 3-9 days) and gag (IQR: 5-9 days), whilst the genome placed it at a median of 10 days (IQR: 4-19). Multiply-founded infections proved problematic to date. Our ability to compare timing inferences to precise estimates of HIV-1 infection (within a week) highlights that molecular dating methods can be applied to within-host datasets from early infection. Nonetheless, our results also suggest caution when using uniform clock and population models or short genes with limited information content.","1458":"Infectious disease epidemics such as influenza and Ebola pose a serious threat to global public health. It is crucial to characterize the disease and the evolution of the ongoing epidemic efficiently and accurately. Computational epidemiology can model the disease progress and underlying contact network, but suffers from the lack of real-time and fine-grained surveillance data. Social media, on the other hand, provides timely and detailed disease surveillance, but is insensible to the underlying contact network and disease model. This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised deep learning framework that integrates the strengths of computational epidemiology and social media mining techniques. Specifically, this framework learns the social media users' health states and intervention actions in real time, which are regularized by the underlying disease model and contact network. Conversely, the learned knowledge from social media can be fed into computational epidemic model to improve the efficiency and accuracy of disease diffusion modeling. We propose an online optimization algorithm to substantialize the above interactive learning process iteratively to achieve a consistent stage of the integration. The extensive experimental results demonstrated that our approach can effectively characterize the spatio-temporal disease diffusion, outperforming competing methods by a substantial margin on multiple metrics.","1459":"Based on a video-based observational study, we compared the validity of four commonly used distraction indicators (total duration of distraction while crossing a street, proportion of distracted time over total street-crossing time, duration of the longest distraction time, and total number of distractions) in predicting three pedestrian safety outcomes (near-crash incidence, frequency of looking left and right, and speed crossing the street) across three types of distraction (mobile phone use, talking to other pedestrians, eating\/drinking\/smoking). Change in Harrell's C statistic was calculated to assess the validity of each distraction indicator based on multivariable regression models including only covariates and including both covariates and the distraction indicator.Multiple distraction indicators have been applied to measure street-crossing distraction but their validities in predicting pedestrian safety are poorly understood.Heterogeneous capacities in predicting the three safety outcomes across the four distraction indicators were observed: 1) duration of the longest distraction time was most predictive for the occurrence of near-crashes and looks left and right among pedestrians with all three types of distraction combined and talking with other pedestrians (Harrell's C statistic changes ranged from 0.0310 to 0.0335, P\u2009<\u20090.05), and for the occurrence of near-crashes for pedestrians involving mobile phone use (Harrell's C statistic change: 0.0053); 2) total duration of distraction was most predictive for speed crossing the street among pedestrians with the combination and each of the three types of distraction (Harrell's C statistic changes ranged from 0.0037 to 0.0111, P\u2009<\u20090.05), frequency of looking left and right among pedestrians distracted by mobile phone use (Harrell's C statistic change: 0.0115), and the occurrence of near-crash among pedestrians eating, drinking, or smoking (Harrell's C statistic change: 0.0119); and 3) the total number of distractions was the most predictive indicator of frequency of looking left and right among pedestrians eating, drinking, or smoking (Harrell's C statistic change: 0.0013). Sensitivity analyses showed the results were robust to change in grouping criteria of the four distraction indicators.Future research should consider the pedestrian safety outcomes and type of distractions to select the best distraction indicator.","1460":"Guyana reported a significant rise in malaria between 2008 and 2014. As there was no evidence of impairment of national malaria control strategies, public health authorities attributed the surge to a temporal increase in gold mining activity in forested regions. However, systematic analysis of this association is lacking because of the difficulties associated with collecting reliable data for both malaria and mining. We aimed to investigate the association between the international gold price and Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission in Guyana between 2007 and 2019. We also aimed to evaluate the association between P falciparum cases and the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation pattern, which has previously been suggested as a major driver of malaria.Our analysis provides evidence that the P falciparum malaria surge observed in Guyana between 2008 and 2014 was likely to have been driven mainly by an increase in gold mining, while climate factors might have contributed synergistically. We propose that the international gold price over time is a useful indicator of malaria trends. We conclude that the feasibility of malaria elimination in Guyana, and in other areas in the Amazon where malaria and gold mining overlap, should be evaluated against the challenges posed by rapidly rising gold prices.Ram\u00f3n Areces Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and National Institute of General Medical Sciences.We used national malaria surveillance data from Guyana to estimate the correlation over time between the international gold price and reported P falciparum infections in individuals who were likely to be involved in mining activities (ie, men and boys aged between 15 and 50 years who were living in mining regions) for each month between 2007 and 2019. We compared the estimates with those obtained from individuals who were unlikely to be directly involved in mining activities (ie, women, children aged 12 years and younger, and adults aged over 70 years) and estimates obtained from individuals living in non-mining regions. We also evaluated the correlation between P falciparum infections and the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation pattern in the same subpopulations and time period. Lastly, we evaluated the performance of a statistical model formulated to estimate P falciparum infections in real time using the international gold price as the predictor variable.The proportion of P falciparum malaria cases in temporary residents, which was used as a proxy for circulating individuals involved in gold mining, was highest during the years of peak gold price (ie, between 2008 and 2014). Cases of malaria in all demographic groups showed a strong positive correlation with the gold price, but only in regions with mining camps (0\u00b788 [95% CI 0\u00b784-0\u00b789] for boys and men aged between 15 and 50 years and 0\u00b780 [0\u00b773-0\u00b785] for the aggregated population of women, children aged 12 years and younger, and adults older than 70 years). The highest correlation occurred earlier in men and boys aged between 15 and 50 years, the demographic most likely to be miners, suggesting that transmission in mining camps is followed by infections in the community. On the basis of these findings, we were able to reliably forecast P falciparum malaria trends using only the gold price as the predictor variable. A 1% increase in gold price was associated with a 2\u00b713% increase in P falciparum infections after 1 month in the mining populations, and with a 1\u00b763% increase after 2 months in the non-mining populations. Lastly, La Ni\u00f1a climatic events showed an additional, smaller positive correlation with malaria transmission.","1461":"Analysis of previously published target-cell limited viral dynamic models for pathogens such as HIV, hepatitis, and influenza generally rely on standard techniques from dynamical systems theory or numerical simulation. We use a quasi-steady-state approximation to derive an analytic solution for the model with a non-cytopathic effect, that is, when the death rates of uninfected and infected cells are equal. The analytic solution provides time evolution values of all three compartments of uninfected cells, infected cells, and virus. Results are compared with numerical simulation using clinical data for equine infectious anemia virus, a retrovirus closely related to HIV, and the utility of the analytic solution is discussed.","1462":"The effectiveness of dengue control interventions depends on an effective integrated surveillance system that involves analysis of multiple variables associated with the natural history and transmission dynamics of this arbovirus. Entomological indicators associated with other biotic and abiotic parameters can assertively characterize the spatiotemporal trends related to dengue transmission risk. However, the unpredictability of the non-linear nature of the data, as well as the uncertainty and subjectivity inherent in biological data are often neglected in conventional models.Our study demonstrated the ability of fuzzy logic to characterize the city's spatiotemporal heterogeneity in relation to areas at high risk of dengue transmission, suggesting it can be considered as part of an integrated surveillance system to support timely decision-making.As an alternative for analyzing dengue-related data, we devised a fuzzy-logic approach to test ensembles of these indicators across categories, which align with the concept of degrees of truth to characterize the success of dengue transmission by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in an endemic city in Brazil. We used locally gathered entomological, demographic, environmental and epidemiological data as input sources using freely available data on digital platforms. The outcome variable, risk of transmission, was aggregated into three categories: low, medium, and high. Spatial data was georeferenced and the defuzzified values were interpolated to create a map, translating our findings to local public health managers and decision-makers to direct further vector control interventions.The classification of low, medium, and high transmission risk areas followed a seasonal trend expected for dengue occurrence in the region. The fuzzy approach captured the 2020 outbreak, when only 14.06% of the areas were classified as low risk. The classification of transmission risk based on the fuzzy system revealed effective in predicting an increase in dengue transmission, since more than 75% of high-risk areas had an increase in dengue incidence within the following 15 days.","1463":"Compared with current practice (risk-based with laboratory-based testing), routine rapid point-of-care testing initiated and performed by a counselor identified 68% more cases after (nonreflex) RNA testing in the first month of the intervention and led to a 17% reduction in cirrhosis cases and a 22% reduction in liver deaths among those with cirrhosis over a lifetime. Routine rapid testing initiated by a counselor or a clinician provided better outcomes at either lower total cost or at lower cost per QALY gained, when compared with all other strategies. Findings were most influenced by the proportion of patients informed of their anti-HCV test results.Routine anti-HCV testing followed by prompt RNA testing for positives is recommended at FQHCs to identify infections. If using dedicated staff or point-of-care testing is not feasible, then measures to improve immediate patient knowledge of antibody status should be considered.The opioid epidemic has been associated with an increase in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) have a high burden of hepatitis C disease and could serve as venues to enhance testing and treatment.We estimated clinical outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of hepatitis C testing and treatment at US FQHCs using individual-based simulation modeling. We used individual-level data from 57 FQHCs to model 9 strategies, including permutations of HCV antibody testing modality, person initiating testing, and testing approach. Outcomes included life expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), hepatitis C cases identified, treated and cured; and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.","1464":"African horse sickness (AHS) is a vector-borne disease transmitted by Culicoides spp., endemic to sub-Saharan Africa. There have been many examples of historic and recent outbreaks in the Middle East, Asia and Europe. However, not much is known about infection dynamics and outbreak potential in these naive populations. In order to better inform a previously published ordinary differential equation model, we performed a systematic literature search to identify studies documenting experimental infection of naive (control) equids in vaccination trials. Data on the time until the onset of viraemia, clinical signs and death after experimental infection of a naive equid and duration of viraemia were extracted. The time to viraemia was 4.6 days and the time to clinical signs was 4.9 days, longer than the previously estimated latent period of 3.7 days. The infectious periods of animals that died\/were euthanised or survived were found to be 3.9 and 8.7 days, whereas previous estimations were 4.4 and 6 days, respectively. The case fatality was also found to be higher than previous estimations. The updated parameter values (along with other more recently published estimates from literature) resulted in an increase in the number of host deaths, decrease in the duration of the outbreak, and greater prevalence in vectors.

Convincing associations between TRAP and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases are known, but the underlying biological mechanisms are not well established. High-resolution metabolomics (HRM) is a promising platform for untargeted characterization of molecular mechanisms between TRAP and health indexes.), organic carbon (OC), and elemental carbon (EC) among 180 participants of the Center for Health Discovery and Well-Being (CHDWB), a cohort of Emory University-affiliated employees. and EC were associated most consistently with these pathways. We confirmed the chemical identity of 8 metabolic features in negative ESI and 2 features in positive ESI, including metabolites closely linked to oxidative stress and inflammation, such as histamine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and proline.We identified a range of ambient pollutants, including components of TRAP, associated with differences in the metabolic phenotype among the cohort of 180 subjects. We found Tobit models to be a robust approach to handle missing data among the metabolic features. The results were encouraging of further use of HRM and MWAS approaches for characterizing molecular mechanisms underlying exposure to TRAP.A cross-sectional study was conducted on baseline visits of 180 CHDWB participants enrolled during 2008-2012, in whom HRM profiling was determined in plasma samples using liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry with positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) modes. Ambient pollution concentrations were measured at an ambient monitor near downtown Atlanta. Metabolic perturbations associated with TRAP exposures were assessed following an untargeted metabolome-wide association study (MWAS) framework using feature-specific Tobit regression models, followed by enriched pathway analysis and chemical annotation.","1466":"An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to 95\u2008333 confirmed cases as of March 5, 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced., assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.Wellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and National Institute for Health Research.We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.Our results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.","1467":"Treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), particularly medication for OUD, is highly effective; however, retention in OUD treatment is a significant challenge. We aimed to identify key risk factors for premature exit from OUD treatment.Random Forest outperformed other methods (ROC-AUC:\u00a074%). The most influential risk factors included characteristics of service setting, geographic region, primary source of payment, and referral source. Race, ethnicity, and sex had far weaker predictive impacts. When stratified by treatment setting and length of stay, employment status and delay (days waited) to enter treatment were among the most influential factors. Their importance increased as treatment duration decreased. Notably, importance of referral source increased as the treatment duration increased. Finally, age and age of first use were important factors for lengths of stay of 2-7 days and in detox treatment settings.The key factors of OUD treatment attrition identified in this analysis should be more closely explored (e.g., in causal studies) to inform targeted policies and interventions to improve models of care.We analyzed 2,381,902 cross-sectional treatment episodes for individuals in the U.S., discharged between Jan\/1\/2015 and Dec\/31\/2019. We developed classification models (Random Forest, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Bagged CART, and Boosted CART), and analyzed 31 potential risk factors for premature treatment exit, including treatment characteristics, substance use history, socioeconomic status, and demographic characteristics. We stratified our analysis based on length of stay in treatment and service setting. Models were compared using cross-validation and the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC).","1468":"Results indicate large burden of hearing loss in the United States, with an estimated 1 in 5 people experiencing this condition. While many cases of hearing loss in the United States were mild, growing prevalence, low usage of hearing aids, and aging populations indicate the rising impact of this condition in future years and the increasing importance of domestic access to hearing healthcare services. Large-scale audiometric surveys such as NHANES are needed to regularly assess hearing loss burden and access to healthcare, improving our understanding of who is impacted by hearing loss and what groups are most amenable to intervention.An estimated 72.88 million (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 68.53 to 77.30) people in the United States had hearing loss in 2019, accounting for 22.2% (20.9 to 23.6) of the total population. Hearing loss was responsible for 2.24 million (1.56 to 3.11) YLDs (3.6% (2.8 to 4.7) of total US YLDs). Age-standardized prevalence was higher in males (17.7% [16.7 to 18.8]) compared with females (11.9%, [11.2 to 12.5]). While most cases of hearing loss were mild (64.3%, 95% UI 61.0 to 67.6), disability was concentrated in cases that were moderate or more severe. The all-age prevalence of hearing loss in the United States was 28.1% (25.7 to 30.8) higher in 2019 than in 1990, despite stable age-standardized prevalence. An estimated 9.7% (8.6 to 11.0) of individuals with mild to profound hearing loss utilized a hearing aid, while 32.5% (31.9 to 33.2) of individuals with hearing loss experienced tinnitus. Occupational noise exposure was responsible for 11.2% (10.2 to 12.4) of hearing loss YLDs.We utilized population-representative surveys from the United States to estimate hearing loss prevalence for the Global Burden of Disease study. A key input data source in modeled estimates are the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), years 1988 to 2010. We ran hierarchical severity-specific models to estimate hearing loss prevalence. We then scaled severity-specific models to sum to total hearing impairment prevalence, adjusted estimates for hearing aid coverage, and split estimates by etiology and tinnitus status. We computed years lived with disability (YLDs), which quantifies the amount of health loss associated with a condition depending on severity and creates a common metric to compare the burden of disparate diseases. This was done by multiplying the prevalence of severity-specific hearing loss by corresponding disability weights, with additional weighting for tinnitus comorbidity.This article describes key data sources and methods used to estimate hearing loss in the United States, in the Global Burden of Disease study. Then, trends in hearing loss are described for 2019, including temporal trends from 1990 to 2019, changing prevalence over age, severity patterns, and utilization of hearing aids.","1469":"We used an ingredients-based approach to estimate the financial costs for conducting both a school-based dengue serosurvey and school-based individual dengue screening within a typical province in Vietnam, using an existing commercial indirect immunoglobulin G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. This costing is hypothetical and based on estimates regarding the resources that would be required to perform such activities.After new analysis, Sanofi Pasteur now recommends their dengue vaccine (Dengvaxia) should only be given to individuals previously infected with dengue and the World Health Organization's recommendations regarding its use are currently being revised. As a result, the potential costs of performing large-scale individual dengue screening and\/or dengue serosurveys have become an important consideration for decision making by policymakers in dengue-endemic areas.We estimated that performing a school-based individual screening of 9-year-olds would cost US$9.25 per child tested or US$197,827 in total for a typical province. We also estimated that a school-based serosurvey would cost US$10,074, assuming one class from each of the grades that include 8- to 11-year-olds are sampled at each of the 12 selected schools across the province.The study indicates that using this vaccine safely on a large-scale will incur noteworthy operational costs. It is crucial that these be considered in future cost-effectiveness analyses informing how and where the vaccine is deployed.","1470":"Dracunculus medinensis (Guinea worm [GW]), a zoonotic nematode targeted for eradication, has been managed using interventions aimed at humans; however, increases in domestic dog GW infections highlight the need for novel approaches. We conducted two clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of subcutaneously injected flubendazole (FBZ) as a treatment of GW infection. The first trial was conducted administering FBZ to experimentally infected ferrets; the second trial involved administering FBZ or a placebo to domestic dogs in the Republic of Tchad (Chad). We found contrasting results between the two trials. When adult gravid female GW were recovered from ferrets treated with FBZ, larvae presented in poor condition, with low to no motility, and an inability to infect copepods. Histopathology results indicated a disruption to morulae development within uteri of worms from treated animals. Results from the trial in Chadian dogs failed to indicate significant treatment of or prevention against GW infection. However, the difference in treatment intervals (1 month for ferrets and 6 months for dogs) or the timing of treatment (ferrets were treated later in the GW life-cycle than dogs) could explain different responses to the subcutaneous FBZ injections. Both trials provided valuable data guiding the use of FBZ in future trials (such as decreasing treatment intervals or increasing the dose of FBZ in dogs to increase exposure), and highlighted important lessons learned during the implementation of a field-based, double-blinded randomized control trial in Chadian dogs.","1471":"We extend previous studies on the impact of masks on COVID-19 outcomes by investigating an unprecedented breadth and depth of health outcomes, geographical resolutions, types of mask mandates, early versus later waves and controlling for other government interventions, mobility testing rate and weather. We show that mask mandates are associated with a statistically significant decrease in new cases (-3.55 per 100K), deaths (-0.13 per 100K), and the proportion of hospital admissions (-2.38 percentage points) up to 40 days after the introduction of mask mandates both at the state and county level. These effects are large, corresponding to 14% of the highest recorded number of cases, 13% of deaths, and 7% of admission proportion. We also find that mask mandates are linked to a 23.4 percentage point increase in mask adherence in four diverse states. Given the recent lifting of mandates, we estimate that the ending of mask mandates in these states is associated with a decrease of -3.19 percentage points in mask adherence and 12 per 100K (13% of the highest recorded number) of daily new cases with no significant effect on hospitalizations and deaths. Lastly, using a large novel survey dataset of 847 thousand responses in 69 countries, we introduce the novel results that community mask adherence and community attitudes towards masks are associated with a reduction in COVID-19 cases and deaths. Our results have policy implications for reinforcing the need to maintain and encourage mask-wearing by the public, especially in light of some states starting to remove their mask mandates.","1472":" assays, except for cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-1 in sVNT.","1473":"This study aimed to explore methodological challenges in using social Facebook networks to design peer network-based interventions for HIV prevention and present techniques to overcome these challenges.All respondents and 78.9% (183\/232) of nonrespondents selected as peer change agents by eigenvector on the imputed networks were also selected as peer change agents on the observed networks. For keyplayer, the agreement was much lower; 42.7% (47\/110) and 35.3% (110\/312) of respondent and nonrespondent peer change agents, respectively, selected on the imputed networks were also selected on the observed network. Eigenvector also produced a stable set of peer change agents across the 100 imputed networks and was much less sensitive to the specified relational boundary.This is a case study from an HIV prevention project among young black men who have sex with men. Individual-level prevention interventions have had limited success among young black men who have sex with men, a population that is disproportionately affected by HIV; peer network-based interventions are a promising alternative. Facebook is an attractive digital platform because it enables broad characterization of social networks. There are, however, several challenges in using Facebook data for peer interventions, including the large size of Facebook networks, difficulty in assessing appropriate methods to identify candidate peer change agents, boundary specification issues, and partial observation of social network data.Although we do not have a gold standard indicating which algorithm produces the most optimal set of peer change agents, the lower sensitivity of eigenvector centrality to key assumptions leads us to conclude that it may be preferable. The methods we employed to address the challenges in using Facebook networks may prove timely, given the rapidly increasing interest in using online social networks to improve population health.Our sample included 298 uConnect study respondents who answered a bio-behavioral survey in person and whose Facebook friend lists were downloaded (2013-2014). The study participants had over 180,000 total Facebook friends who were not involved in the study (nonrespondents). We did not observe friendships between these nonrespondents. Given the large number of nonrespondents whose networks were partially observed, a relational boundary was specified to select nonrespondents who were well connected to the study respondents and who may be more likely to influence the health behaviors of young black men who have sex with men. A stochastic model-based imputation technique, derived from the exponential random graph models, was applied to simulate 100 networks where unobserved friendships between nonrespondents were imputed. To identify peer change agents, the eigenvector centrality and keyplayer positive algorithms were used; both algorithms are suitable for identifying individuals in key network positions for information diffusion. For both algorithms, we assessed the sensitivity of identified peer change agents to the imputation model, the stability of identified peer change agents across the imputed networks, and the effect of the boundary specification on the identification of peer change agents.","1474":"We established a 5-year randomized placebo-controlled trial of repeated influenza vaccination (Flublok, Sanofi Pasteur) in adults 18-45 years of age. Participants were randomized equally between five groups, with planned annual receipt of vaccination (V) or saline placebo (P) as follows: P-P-P-P-V, P-P-P-V-V, P-P-V-V-V, P-V-V-V-V, or V-V-V-VV. Serum samples were collected each year just before vaccination and after 30 and 182 days. A subset of sera were tested by hemagglutination inhibition assays, focus reduction neutralization tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays against vaccine strains.From 23 October 2020 through 11 March 2021 we enrolled and randomized 447 adults. We selected sera from 95 participants at five timepoints from the first two study years for testing. Among vaccinated individuals, antibody titers increased between days 0 and 30 against each of the vaccine strains, with substantial increases for first-time vaccinees and smaller increases for repeat vaccinees, who had higher pre-vaccination titers in year 2. There were statistically significant reductions in the proportion of participants achieving a four-fold greater rise in antibody titer for the repeat vaccinees for A(H1N1), B\/Victoria and B\/Yamagata, but not for influenza A(H3N2). There were no statistically significant differences between groups in geometric mean titers at day 30 or the proportions of participants with antibody titers \u226540 at day 30 for any of the vaccine strains.Studies have reported that repeated annual vaccination may influence the effectiveness of the influenza vaccination in the current season. The mechanisms underlying these differences are unclear but might include \"focusing\" of the adaptive immune response to older strains.In the first two years, repeat vaccinees and first-time vaccinees had similar post-vaccination geometric mean titers to all four vaccine strains, indicative of similar levels of clinical protection. The vaccine strains of A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) were updated in year 2, providing an opportunity to explore antigenic distances between those strains in humans in subsequent years.","1475":", estimated from experimental data. This helps to explain how A. aegypti can sustain explosive epidemics such as ZIKV despite relatively poor vector competence in single-feed laboratory trials. Together, these data demonstrate a direct and unrecognized link between mosquito feeding behaviour, EIP and vector competence.","1476":"Background\r\nReactive case detection is an approach that has been proposed as a tool for malaria elimination in low-transmission settings. It is an intuitively justified approach based on the concept of space\u0096time clustering of malaria cases. When an index malaria clinical case is detected, it triggers reactive screening and treatment in the index house and neighbouring houses. However, the efficacy of this approach at varying screening radii and malaria prevalence remains ill defined.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nData were obtained from a detailed demographic and geographic surveillance study in four villages on the Myanmar\u0096Thailand border. Clinical cases were recorded at village malaria clinics and were linked back to patients\u0092 residencies. These data were used to simulate the efficacy of reactive case detection for clinical cases using rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). Simulations took clinical cases in a given month and tabulated the number of cases that would have been detected in the following month at varying screening radii around the index houses. Simulations were run independently for both falciparum and vivax malaria. Each simulation of a reactive case detection effort was run in comparison with a strategy using random selection of houses for screening.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nIn approximately half of the screenings for falciparum and 10% for vivax it would have been impossible to detect any malaria cases regardless of the screening strategy because the screening would have occurred during times when there were no cases. When geographically linked cases were present in the simulation, reactive case detection would have only been successful at detecting most malaria cases using larger screening radii (150-m radius and above). At this screening radius and above, reactive case detection does not perform better than random screening of an equal number of houses in the village. Screening within very small radii detects only a very small proportion of cases, but despite this low performance is better than random screening with the same sample size.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nThe results of these simulations indicate that reactive case detection for clinical cases using RDTs has limited ability in halting transmission in regions of low and unstable transmission. This is linked to high spatial heterogeneity of cases, acquisition of malaria infections outside the village, as well missing asymptomatic infections. When cases are few and sporadic, reactive case detection would result in major time and budgetary losses.","1477":"Hybrid and 3-arm trial design features facilitate the integrated evaluation of both brief, highly implementable, and more intensive, less implementable, treatment options for UAU among PLWH in sub-Saharan Africa. Use of ACASI and alcohol biomarkers will strengthen understanding of treatment effects.Clinical and quality of life outcomes in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) are undermined by unhealthy alcohol use (UAU), which is highly prevalent in this population and is often complicated by mental health (MH) or other substance use (SU) comorbidity. In sub-Saharan Africa, evidence-based and implementable treatment options for people with HIV and UAU are needed.We are conducting a hybrid clinical effectiveness-implementation trial at three public-sector HIV clinics in Lusaka, Zambia. Adults with HIV, who report UAU, and have suboptimal HIV clinical outcomes, will be randomized to one of three arms: an alcohol-focused brief intervention (BI), the BI with additional referral to a transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy (Common Elements Treatment Approach [CETA]), or standard of care. The BI and CETA will be provided by HIV peer counselors, a common cadre of lay health worker in Zambia. Clinical outcomes will include HIV viral suppression, alcohol use, assessed by audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) and direct alcohol biomarkers, Phophatidylethanol and Ethyl glucuronide, and comorbid MH and other SU. A range of implementation outcomes including cost effectiveness will also be analyzed.","1478":"Twenty-four CID patients and twenty-five healthy controls matched for age, right-hand dominance, educational level, and gender were examined during verbal fluency tasks (VFT) using NIRS. A covariance analysis was conducted to analyze differences of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) changes in prefrontal cortex (PFC) between the two groups and reduce the influence of the severity of depression. Pearson correlation coeffcients were calculated to examine the relationship between the oxy-Hb changes, with the severity of insomnia and depressive symptoms assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD).The present study detected dysfunctions in PFC in spite of intact performance which indicates the role of PFC in the neurophysiological underpinnings. Left OFC function is associated with insomnia symptoms and right DLPFC function is associated with depressive symptoms.The number of words generated during the VFT in CID groups showed no statistical differences with healthy controls. CID patients showed hypoactivation in the PFC during the cognitive task. In addition, we found that the function of left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) during the VFT was significantly negatively correlated with the PSQI scores and the function of right dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) was significantly negatively correlated with the HAMD scores.Daytime complaints such as memory and attention deficits and failure to accomplish daily tasks are common in insomnia patients. However, objective psychological tests to detect cognitive impairment are equivocal. Neural function associated with cognitive performance may explain the discrepancy. The aim of this study was to investigate the hemodynamic response patterns of patients with chronic insomnia disorder (CID) using the noninvasive and low-cost functional neuroimaging technique of multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in order to identify changes of neural function associated with cognitive performance.","1479":"We fitted a dynamic transmission model to country-level daily reported COVID-19 mortality in 13 MICs in Europe (Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Georgia, Republic of Moldova, Russian Federation, Serbia, North Macedonia, Turkey, and Ukraine). A vaccine product with characteristics similar to those of the Oxford\/AstraZeneca COVID-19 (AZD1222) vaccine was used in the base case scenario and was complemented by sensitivity analyses around efficacies similar to other COVID-19 vaccines. Both fixed dosing intervals at 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks and dose-specific intervals that prioritise specific doses for certain age groups were tested. Optimal intervals minimise COVID-19 mortality between March 2021 and December 2022. We incorporated the emergence of variants of concern (VOCs) into the model and conducted a benefit-risk assessment to quantify the tradeoff between health benefits versus adverse events following immunisation.In settings where the COVID-19 vaccine supply is constrained, extending the intervals between the first and second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine may allow more people receive their first doses earlier. Our aim is to estimate the health impact of COVID-19 vaccination alongside benefit-risk assessment of different dosing intervals in 13 middle-income countries (MICs) of Europe.World Health Organization.We infer that longer dosing intervals of over six months could reduce COVID-19 mortality in MICs of Europe. Certain parameters, such as rapid waning of first-dose induced immunity and increased immune escape through the emergence of VOCs, could significantly shorten the optimal dosing intervals.In all countries modelled, optimal strategies are those that prioritise the first doses among older adults (60+ years) or adults (20+ years), which lead to dosing intervals longer than six months. In comparison, a four-week fixed dosing interval may incur 10.1% [range: 4.3% - 19.0%; n\u00a0=\u00a013 (countries)] more deaths. The rapid waning of the immunity induced by the first dose (i.e. with means ranging 60-120 days as opposed to 360 days in the base case) resulted in shorter optimal dosing intervals of 8-20 weeks. Benefit-risk ratios were the highest for fixed dosing intervals of 8-12 weeks.","1480":"Semi-continuous data, also known as zero-inflated continuous data, have a substantial portion of responses equal to a single value (typically 0) and a continuous, right-skewed distribution among the remaining positive values. For jointly modeling multivariate clustered semi-continuous responses, the covariate effects in the positive parts can be proportionally constrained to the covariate effects in the logistic part, yielding a multivariate two-part fixed effects model. It is shown that, both theoretically and experimentally, the proportionally constrained model is more efficient than the unconstrained model in terms of parameter estimation, and thus provides a deeper understanding of the data structure when the proportionality structure holds. A robust variance estimation method is also introduced and tested under various model mis-specified cases. The proposed model is applied to data from a randomized controlled trial evaluating potential preventive effects of meditation or exercise on duration and severity of acute respiratory infection illness. The new analysis infers that meditation not only has highly significant effects on reduction of acute respiratory infection severity and duration, but also has significant effects on preventing acute respiratory infection, which was not previously reported in the literature.","1481":"Recent decades have seen rapid development of new analytical methods to investigate patterns of interspecific variation. Yet these cutting-edge statistical analyses often rely on data of questionable origin, varying accuracy, and weak comparability, which seem to have reduced the reproducibility of studies. It is time to improve the transparency of comparative data while also making these improved data more widely available. We, the authors, met to discuss how transparency, usability, and reproducibility of comparative data can best be achieved. We propose four guiding principles: 1) data identification with explicit operational definitions and complete descriptions of methods; 2) inclusion of metadata that capture key characteristics of the data, such as sample size, geographic coordinates, and nutrient availability (for example, captive versus wild animals); 3) documentation of the original reference for each datum; and 4) facilitation of effective interactions with the data via user friendly and transparent interfaces. We urge reviewers, editors, publishers, database developers and users, funding agencies, researchers publishing their primary data, and those performing comparative analyses to embrace these standards to increase the transparency, usability, and reproducibility of comparative studies.","1482":" We found that whilst the creation of a composite resistance index for empiric antibiotic therapy was technically feasible, the ATLAS dataset in its current form can only inform on a limited number of infection syndromes. Other open-access AMR surveillance datasets are largely limited to bloodstream infection specimens and cannot directly inform treatment of other syndromes. With improving availability of international AMR data and better understanding of infection aetiology, this approach may prove useful for informing empiric prescribing decisions in settings with limited local AMR surveillance data.","1483":"Patient satisfaction is one indicator used to assess the impact of accreditation on patient care. However, traditional patient satisfaction surveys have a few disadvantages, and some researchers have suggested that social media be used in their place. Social media usage is gaining popularity in healthcare organizations, but there is still a paucity of data to support it. The purpose of this study was to determine the association between online reviews and hospital patient satisfaction and the relationship between online reviews and hospital accreditation. We used a cross-sectional design with data acquired from the official Facebook pages of 48 Malaysian public hospitals, 25 of which are accredited. We collected all patient comments from Facebook reviews of those hospitals between 2018 and 2019. Spearman's correlation and logistic regression were used to evaluate the data. There was a significant and moderate correlation between hospital patient satisfaction and online reviews. Patient satisfaction was closely connected to urban location, tertiary hospital, and previous Facebook ratings. However, hospital accreditation was not found to be significantly associated with online reports of patient satisfaction. This groundbreaking study demonstrates how Facebook reviews can assist hospital administrators in monitoring their institutions' quality of care in real time.","1484":"The scale-up of malaria control efforts has led to marked reductions in malaria burden over the past twenty years, but progress has slowed. Implementation of indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticide, a proven vector control intervention, has been limited and difficult to sustain partly because questions remain on its added impact over widely accepted interventions such as bed nets. Using data from 14 enhanced surveillance health facilities in Uganda, a country with high bed net coverage yet high malaria burden, we estimate the impact of starting and stopping IRS on changes in malaria incidence. We show that stopping IRS was associated with a 5-fold increase in malaria incidence within 10 months, but reinstating IRS was associated with an over 5-fold decrease within 8 months. In areas where IRS was initiated and sustained, malaria incidence dropped by 85% after year 4. IRS could play a critical role in achieving global malaria targets, particularly in areas where progress has stalled.","1485":"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the cause of almost all cases of cervical cancer, a disease that kills some 340,000 women per year. The timeline from initial infection with HPV to the onset of invasive cervical cancer spans decades, and observational studies of this process are limited to settings in which treatment of precancerous lesions was withheld or inadequate. Such studies have been critical for understanding the natural history of HPV. Modeling can shed additional insight on the natural history of HPV, especially across geographical settings with varying prevalence of factors known to affect the host-side immune response to HPV, such as HIV and tobacco use. In this study, we create models for the 30 most populous countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, each with country-specific demographic, and behavioral inputs. We found that it was not possible to fit the data if we assumed that the natural history parameters were exactly identical for all countries, even after accounting for demographic and behavioral differences, but that we could achieve a good fit with the addition of a single immunocompetence parameter for each country. Our results indicate that variation in host immune responses may play a role in explaining the differences in the burden of cervical cancer between countries, which in turn implies a greater need for more geographically diverse data collection to understand the natural history of HPV.","1486":"Effective control of an epidemic relies on the rapid discovery and isolation of infected individuals. Because many infectious diseases spread through interaction, contact tracing is widely used to facilitate case discovery and control. However, what determines the efficacy of contact tracing has not been fully understood. Here we reveal that, compared with 'forward' tracing (tracing to whom disease spreads), 'backward' tracing (tracing from whom disease spreads) is profoundly more effective. The effectiveness of backward tracing is due to simple but overlooked biases arising from the heterogeneity in contacts. We argue that, even if the directionality of infection is unknown, it is possible to perform backward-aiming contact tracing. Using simulations on both synthetic and high-resolution empirical contact datasets, we show that strategically executed contact tracing can prevent a substantial fraction of transmissions with a higher efficiency-in terms of prevented cases per isolation-than case isolation alone. Our results call for a revision of current contact-tracing strategies so that they leverage all forms of bias. It is particularly crucial that we incorporate backward and deep tracing in a digital context while adhering to the privacy-preserving requirements of these new platforms.","1487":"Vaccine hesitancy has been on the rise throughout the past two decades, especially in high income countries where existing pro-vaccination public health communication strategies have proven ineffective. We argue that appealing to other-regarding preferences is one way of improving the effectiveness of public health communication strategies. To test this argument, we assess how vaccination intentions are influenced by the presence of people who cannot vaccinate, such as the immunosuppressed, newborns or pregnant women, using a laboratory experiment where there is a passive player whose welfare depends on the decisions of other, active players. Results suggest that pro-vaccine messages targeting altruism can increase vaccination intentions by: (i) invoking past experiences of dependence and vulnerability; (ii) stressing cooperation as a social norm; and (iii) emphasizing the presence of vulnerable individuals in a given society.","1488":"Background and Objective: Reproduction in poultry has been studied for many years and is a crucial factor to consider when selecting and raising parental lines. Considerable work has focused on broiler breeder males, which has led to the development of feed restriction practices, as well as sex separate rearing, however very little research has been done on layer-type males. In broiler breeders a negative correlation has been found to exist between the Body Weights (BW) and sexual activity of the male. This study was conducted to explore the role of diet during grow out on reproductive traits in leghorn type males. Materials and Methods: Hyline parent stock males were raised on 3 different diets Low (12% CP) Control (18% CP) and High (24% CP). As birds reached sexual maturity, Body Weight (BW), testis size, semen volume, sperm concentration and histology were measured. Results: This trial demonstrated significant (p<0.0001) differences in body weights between the diets. The mean BW of birds were 1214.87, 1435.41 and 1475.96 g fed on the Low diet, control and high diet, respectively. There were significant differences observed in testicle weights. The Low group had a significantly lower mean weight as compared with Control and High groups. Differences in semen volume were observed between the dietary treatment groups, as well as, differences in sperm concentrations at 18-20 weeks of age. Significant differences in development were seen between High and Low groups upon histological examination and scoring on a 0-6 scale, 0 = Immature (no spermatozoa) to 6 = Fully mature (spermatozoa present in all tubules) of the testes high (3.9) low (1.2). Conclusion: These results suggest that feeding high nutrient dense diets during rearing does not result in a decrease in production as observed in broiler breeder males and that low nutrient diets are not as beneficial in layer males as in broiler breeder males.","1489":"How and when the microbiome modulates host adaptation remains an evolutionary puzzle, despite evidence that the extended genetic repertoire of the microbiome can shape host phenotypes and fitness. One complicating factor is that the microbiome is often transmitted imperfectly across host generations, leading to questions about the degree to which the microbiome contributes to host adaptation. Here, using an evolutionary model, we demonstrate that decreasing vertical transmission fidelity can increase microbiome variation, and thus phenotypic variation, across hosts. When the most beneficial microbial genotypes change unpredictably from one generation to the next (for example, in variable environments), hosts can maximize fitness by increasing the microbiome variation among offspring, as this improves the chance of there being an offspring with the right microbial combination for the next generation. Imperfect vertical transmission can therefore be adaptive in varying environments. We characterize how selection on vertical transmission is shaped by environmental conditions, microbiome changes during host development and the contribution of other factors to trait variation. We illustrate how environmentally dependent microbial effects can favour intermediate transmission and set our results in the context of examples from natural systems. We also suggest research avenues to empirically test our predictions. Our model provides a basis to understand the evolutionary pathways that potentially led to the wide diversity of microbe transmission patterns found in nature.","1490":"Comparing the pathogen genomes from several cases of an infectious disease has the potential to help us understand and control outbreaks. Many methods exist to reconstruct a phylogeny from such genomes, which represents how the genomes are related to one another. However, such a phylogeny is not directly informative about transmission events between individuals. TransPhylo is a software tool implemented as an R package designed to bridge the gap between pathogen phylogenies and transmission trees. TransPhylo is based on a combined model of transmission between hosts and pathogen evolution within each host. It can simulate both phylogenies and transmission trees jointly under this combined model. TransPhylo can also reconstruct a transmission tree based on a dated phylogeny, by exploring the space of transmission trees compatible with the phylogeny. A transmission tree can be represented as a coloring of a phylogeny where each color represents a different host of the pathogen, and TransPhylo provides convenient ways to plot these colorings and explore the results.

Statistically significant differences between males and females as well as children's age groups were evaluated. The daily incidental ingestion rate of rubber crumb was calculated.our results suggest that age and contact duration should be considered in risk assessment models to evaluate mouthing activities when children are playing on artificial turf surfaces or playground mats.There are growing health concerns about exposure to toxicants released from recycled tire rubber, which is commonly used in synthetic turf and playground mats. To better estimate children's exposure and risk from recycled tire rubber used in synthetic turf and playground mats, there is a need to collect detailed accurate information on mouthing activity and dermal contact behaviors. The objective of this study was to quantify and analyze micro-level activity time series (MLATS) data from children aged 1-12 years old while playing (non-sport-related games) at turf-like locations and playgrounds. Another objective was to estimate the incidental ingestion rate of rubber crumb among children.For children playing on turf, there were significant differences between younger (1-6 y) and older (7-12 y) children for the mouthing median duration with non-dietary objects and all objects. For children playing on playground structures, we found significant mouthing frequency differences between younger (1-6 y) and older children (7-12 y) with all objects, and for mouthing median duration with non-dietary objects. There were no significant differences between males and females playing on artificial turf-like surfaces or playground mats.

Without route to testing, other epidemiological data will be required to estimate the magnitude of potential bias in a conventional TND study. Since these studies may need to be conducted retrospectively, public health responses should obtain these data, and generic protocols for outbreak and pandemic response studies should emphasize the need to record routes to testing.Using a conventional TND study, our model finds biases in vaccine effectiveness estimates. Bias arises due to differential recruitment from self-reporting and contact-tracing, and due to clustering of vaccination. We estimate the degree of bias when recruitment route is not available, and propose a study design to eliminate the bias if recruitment route is recorded.Infectious disease outbreaks present unique challenges to study designs for vaccine evaluation. Test-negative design (TND) studies have previously been used to estimate vaccine effectiveness and have been proposed for Ebola virus disease (EVD) vaccines. However, there are key differences in how cases and controls are recruited during outbreaks and pandemics of novel pathogens, whcih have implications for the reliability of effectiveness estimates using this design.We use a modelling approach to quantify TND bias for a prophylactic vaccine under varying study and epidemiological scenarios. Our model accounts for heterogeneity in vaccine distribution and for two potential routes to testing and recruitment into the study: self-reporting and contact-tracing. We derive conventional and hybrid TND estimators for this model and suggest ways to translate public health response data into the parameters of the model.","1494":"One of the hallmarks of cancer is the extremely high mutability and genetic instability of tumor cells. Inherent heterogeneity of intra-tumor populations manifests itself in high variability of clone instability rates. Analogously to fitness landscapes, the instability rates of clonal populations form their mutability landscapes. Here, we present MULAN (MUtability LANdscape inference), a maximum-likelihood computational framework for inference of mutation rates of individual cancer subclones using single-cell sequencing data. It utilizes the partial information about the orders of mutation events provided by cancer mutation trees and extends it by inferring full evolutionary history and mutability landscape of a tumor. Evaluation of mutation rates on the level of subclones rather than individual genes allows to capture the effects of genomic interactions and epistasis. We estimate the accuracy of our approach and demonstrate that it can be used to study the evolution of genetic instability and infer tumor evolutionary history from experimental data. MULAN is available at https:\/\/github.com\/compbel\/MULAN.","1495":"Characterizing the long-term kinetics of maternally derived and vaccine-induced measles immunity is critical for informing measles immunization strategies moving forward. Based on two prospective cohorts of children in China, we estimate that maternally derived immunity against measles persists for 2.4 months. Following two-dose series of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) at 8 and 18 months of age, the immune protection against measles is not lifelong, and antibody concentrations are extrapolated to fall below the protective threshold of 200\u2009mIU\/ml at 14.3 years. A catch-up MCV dose in addition to the routine doses between 8 months and 5 years reduce the cumulative incidence of seroreversion by 79.3-88.7% by the age of 6 years. Our findings also support a good immune response after the first MCV vaccination at 8 months. These findings, coupled with the effectiveness of a catch-up dose in addition to the routine doses, could be instrumental to relevant stakeholders when planning routine immunization schedules and supplemental immunization activities.","1496":"Secondary care.The index tests [T-SPOT.TB and QuantiFERON GOLD In-Tube (QFT-GIT)] and new enzyme-linked immunospot assays utilising novel Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens (Rv3615c, Rv2654, Rv3879c and Rv3873) were verified against a composite reference standard applied by a panel of clinical experts blinded to IGRA results.A total of 363 patients had active TB (culture-confirmed and highly probable TB cases), 439 had no active TB and 43 had an indeterminate final diagnosis. Comparing T-SPOT.TB and QFT-GIT, the sensitivities [95% confidence interval (CI)] were 82.3% (95% CI 77.7% to 85.9%) and 67.3% (95% CI 62.1% to 72.2%), respectively, whereas specificities were 82.6% (95% CI 78.6% to 86.1%) and 80.4% (95% CI 76.1% to 84.1%), respectively. T-SPOT.TB was more sensitive than QFT-GIT (relative sensitivity 1.22, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.31; p\u2009<\u20090.001), but the specificities were similar (relative specificity 1.02, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.08; p\u2009=\u20090.3). For both IGRAs the sensitivity was lower and the specificity was higher for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive than for HIV-negative patients. The most promising novel antigen was Rv3615c. The added value of Rv3615c to T-SPOT.TB was a 9% (95% CI 5% to 12%) relative increase in sensitivity at the expense of specificity, which had a relative decrease of 7% (95% CI 4% to 10%). The use of current IGRA tests for ruling out active TB is unlikely to be considered cost-effective if a QALY was valued at \u00a320,000 or \u00a330,000. For T-SPOT.TB, the probability of being cost-effective for a willingness to pay of \u00a320,000\/QALY was 26% and 21%, when patients with indeterminate test results were excluded or included, respectively. In comparison, the QFT-GIT probabilities were 8% and 6%. Although the use of IGRAs is cost saving, the health detriment is large owing to delay in diagnosing active TB, leading to prolonged illness. There was substantial between-patient variation in the tests used in the diagnostic pathway.Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratios were calculated to determine diagnostic accuracy.

Unlike for cholera and other waterborne infections, the role of sanitation and socioeconomic factors on the spatial variation of rotavirus seasonality remains unclear. In the current study, we analyzed their association with rotavirus seasonality, specifically the odds of monsoon cases, across 46 locations from 2001 to 2012 in Dhaka. Drinking water from tube wells, compared to other sources, has a clear protective effect against cases during the monsoon, when flooding and water contamination are more likely. This finding supports a significant environmental component of transmission.","1498":"A recent study in PLOS Biology shows that a betaherpesvirus circulating with the vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus, could serve as an effective vector for a transmissible vaccine capable of reducing the risk of rabies virus spillover in Peru.","1499":"The El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and other climate patterns can have profound impacts on the occurrence of infectious diseases ranging from dengue to cholera. In Africa, El Ni\u00f1o conditions are associated with increased rainfall in East Africa and decreased rainfall in southern Africa, West Africa, and parts of the Sahel. Because of the key role of water supplies in cholera transmission, a relationship between El Ni\u00f1o events and cholera incidence is highly plausible, and previous research has shown a link between ENSO patterns and cholera in Bangladesh. However, there is little systematic evidence for this link in Africa. Using high-resolution mapping techniques, we find that the annual geographic distribution of cholera in Africa from 2000 to 2014 changes dramatically, with the burden shifting to continental East Africa-and away from Madagascar and portions of southern, Central, and West Africa-where almost 50,000 additional cases occur during El Ni\u00f1o years. Cholera incidence during El Ni\u00f1o years was higher in regions of East Africa with increased rainfall, but incidence was also higher in some areas with decreased rainfall, suggesting a complex relationship between rainfall and cholera incidence. Here, we show clear evidence for a shift in the distribution of cholera incidence throughout Africa in El Ni\u00f1o years, likely mediated by El Ni\u00f1o's impact on local climatic factors. Knowledge of this relationship between cholera and climate patterns coupled with ENSO forecasting could be used to notify countries in Africa when they are likely to see a major shift in their cholera risk.","1500":"This study fills a critical gap in estimating the levels of subclinical and asymptomatic infection.

When\r\npreparing for pandemics, social vulnerability needs to be assessed using vulnerability indices to\r\nidentify which populations are at greater risk. In this context, we examined the possible association\r\nof social vulnerabilities in U.S. cities with COVID-19 case fatality ratios. Post-pandemic return to\r\nnormalcy is fraught with uncertainty over the ability of different communities to recover with\r\nvarying degrees of resilience. Towards this, we recommend use of a community resiliency\r\nplanning framework, along with modeling and evaluation of the required measures, which may be\r\nuseful for the Indian scenario.","1502":"Complex biological systems consist of large numbers of interconnected units, characterized by emergent properties such as collective computation. In spite of all the progress in the last decade, we still lack a deep understanding of how these properties arise from the coupling between the structure and dynamics. Here, we introduce the multiscale emergent functional state, which can be represented as a network where links encode the flow exchange between the nodes, calculated using diffusion processes on top of the network. We analyze the emergent functional state to study the distribution of the flow among components of 92 fungal networks, identifying their functional modules at different scales and, more importantly, demonstrating the importance of functional modules for the information content of networks, quantified in terms of network spectral entropy. Our results suggest that the topological complexity of fungal networks guarantees the existence of functional modules at different scales keeping the information entropy, and functional diversity, high.","1503":"Unlike demand studies in other industries, models of provider demand in health care often must omit a price, or any other factor that equilibrates the market such as a waiting time. Estimates of the consumer response to quality may consequently be attenuated, if the limited capacity of individual physicians prevents some consumers from obtaining higher quality. We propose a tractable method to address this problem by adding a congestion effect to standard discrete-choice models. We show analytically how this can improve forecasts of the consumer response to quality. We then apply this method to the market for heart surgery, and find that the attenuation bias in estimated quality effects can be important empirically.","1504":"Here, we provide two methods for monitoring reinfection trends in routine surveillance data to identify signatures of changes in reinfection risk and apply these approaches to data from South Africa's SARS-CoV-2 epidemic to date. While we found no evidence of increased reinfection risk associated with circulation of Beta (B.1.351) or Delta (B.1.617.2) variants, we find clear, population-level evidence to suggest immune evasion by the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant in previously infected individuals in South Africa. Reinfections occurring between 01 November 2021 and 31 January 2022 were detected in individuals infected in all three previous waves, and there has been an increase in the risk of having a third infection since mid-November 2021.","1505":"Four zebra finches in a closed research colony presented with variable clinical signs, including masses, skin lesions, shivering, and\/or ruffled feathers. These birds were not responsive to treatment efforts; 3 died and one was euthanized. All 4 were submitted for necropsy to determine the cause of the clinical signs. Gross necropsy and histopathologic findings from all birds resulted in a diagnosis of round cell neoplasia in multiple organs, including the skin, liver, kidney, and reproductive tract, with intranuclear inclusion bodies in the neoplastic cells. In all 4 cases, immunohistochemical staining showed strong immunoreactivity for CD3 in 70% to 80% of the neoplastic round cells, with a relatively small subset that were immunopositive for Pax5. These findings supported a diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma. Frozen liver tissue from one case was submitted for next-generation sequencing (NGS), which revealed viral RNA with 100% sequence homology to canary polyomavirus strain 34639 that had originally been identified in a European goldfinch. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded scrolls from another case were also submitted for NGS, which revealed viral RNA with 97.2% sequence homology to canary polyomavirus strain 37273 that had originally been identified in a canary. To localize the virus in situ, RNAscope hybridization was performed using a probe designed to target the VP1 gene of the sequenced virus in frozen liver tissue. In all 4 cases, disseminated and robust hybridization signals were detected in neoplastic cells. These findings indicate that polyomaviruses have the potential to be oncogenic in zebra finches.","1506":"The correlation of phenotypic outcomes with genetic variation and environmental factors is a core pursuit in biology and biomedicine. Numerous challenges impede our progress: patient phenotypes may not match known diseases, candidate variants may be in genes that have not been characterized, model organisms may not recapitulate human or veterinary diseases, filling evolutionary gaps is difficult, and many resources must be queried to find potentially significant genotype-phenotype associations. Non-human organisms have proven instrumental in revealing biological mechanisms. Advanced informatics tools can identify phenotypically relevant disease models in research and diagnostic contexts. Large-scale integration of model organism and clinical research data can provide a breadth of knowledge not available from individual sources and can provide contextualization of data back to these sources. The Monarch Initiative (monarchinitiative.org) is a collaborative, open science effort that aims to semantically integrate genotype-phenotype data from many species and sources in order to support precision medicine, disease modeling, and mechanistic exploration. Our integrated knowledge graph, analytic tools, and web services enable diverse users to explore relationships between phenotypes and genotypes across species.","1507":"For each interquartile range (IQR) increase, both SR (excess risk (ER): 4.9%, 95% CI: 3.2-6.7%) and RH (ER: 4.0%, 95% CI: 2.6-5.4%) showed the largest risk for MD-related ED visits at lag 0-9\u00a0days. While temperature presented a short-term risk (highest ER at lag 0-2\u00a0days: 3.7%, 95% CI: 2.5-4.9%), HI increased risk over a two-week period (ER range: 3.7-4.5%), and rainfall hours showed an inverse association with MDs (ER: -0.5%, 95% CI: 0.9-(-0.1)%). Additionally, we observed stronger association of SR, RH, temperature, and HI in September and October. Combination of high SR, RH, and temperature displayed the largest increase in MDs (ER: 7.49%, 95% CI: 3.95-11.15%). The weather-MD association was stronger for psychoactive substance usage, mood disorders, adult behavior disorders, males, Hispanics, African Americans, individuals aged 46-65, or Medicare patients.We conducted a time-stratified, case-crossover study. MDs-related ED visits (primary diagnosis) from May-October 2017-2018 were obtained from New York State (NYS) discharge database. We obtained solar radiation (SR), relative humidity (RH), temperature, heat index (HI), and rainfall from Mesonet, a real-time monitoring system spaced about 17 miles (126 stations) across NYS. We used conditional logistic regression to assess the weather-MD associations.Mental disorders (MDs) are behavioral or mental patterns that cause significant distress or impairment of personal functioning. Previously, temperature has been linked to MDs, but most studies suffered from exposure misclassification due to limited monitoring sites. We aimed to assess whether multiple meteorological factors could jointly trigger MD-related emergency department (ED) visits in warm season, using a highly dense weather monitoring system.Hot and humid weather, especially the joint effect of high sun radiation, temperature and relative humidity showed the highest risk of MD diseases. We found stronger weather-MD associations in summer transitional months, males, and minority groups. These findings also need further confirmation.","1508":"The majority of breakthrough sequences with lineage assignment were classified as Delta variants (74.6%) and occurred, on average, about three months (104 \u00b1 57.5 days) after full vaccination, at the same time (June-July 2021) of Delta variant exponential spread within the county. Six Delta variant transmission pairs between fully vaccinated individuals were identified through contact tracing, three of which were confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Delta breakthroughs exhibited broad viral RNA copy number values during acute infection (IQR 1.2 - 8.64 Log copies\/ml), on average 38% lower than matched unvaccinated patients (3.29 - 10.81 Log copies\/ml, p<0.00001). Nevertheless, 49-50% of all breakthroughs, and 56-60% of Delta-infected breakthroughs exhibited viral RNA levels above the transmissibility threshold (4 Log copies\/ml) irrespective of time post vaccination.SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant has caused a dramatic resurgence in infections in the United Sates, raising questions regarding potential transmissibility among vaccinated individuals.Delta infection transmissibility and general viral RNA quantification patterns in vaccinated individuals suggest limited levels of sterilizing immunity that need to be considered by public health policies. In particular, ongoing evaluation of vaccine boosters should specifically address whether extra vaccine doses curb breakthrough contribution to epidemic spread.Between October 2020 and July 2021, we sequenced 4,439 SARS-CoV-2 full genomes, 23% of all known infections in Alachua County, Florida, including 109 vaccine breakthrough cases. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted to evaluate associations between viral RNA burden and patient characteristics. Contact tracing and phylogenetic analysis were used to investigate direct transmissions involving vaccinated individuals.","1509":"This paper studied the effects of two amendments (iron sulfate[Fe2 (SO4)3] and calcium carbonate[CaCO3]) on the bioavailability of Pb, Cd and As in a garden soil and on the migration and accumulation of Pb, Cd and As in pepper through an in-situ experiment planting pepper plants. The results indicated that:\u2460Addition of these amendments significantly decreased TCLP extractable contents of Pb and Cd in soil, and increased TCLP extractable contents of As.\u2461Compared with the control group, addition of Fe2 (SO4)3 led to reduction in contents of Pb and Cd in pepper fruits by 7.2%-22.9% and 2.3%-2.9%, respectively, but no obvious changes were observed for As contents in pepper fruits. Meanwhile, addition of CaCO3 decreased the contents of Pb, Cd and As in pepper fruits by 15.8%-16.3%, 11.8%-15.0%, and 0.03%-53.2%, respectively. \u2462The maximum reductions for the translocation factors of Pb, Cd and As from stem to fruits in pepper plants were 16.7%, 68.0%, 10.2%, respectively, due to Fe2(SO4)3 application and 16.7%, 51.5%, 45.6%, respectively, due to CaCO3 application, compared with the control group. It was obvious that Fe2 (SO4)3 and CaCO3 could both effectively decrease the migration of soil Pb, Cd and As to pepper plants, but the effects of CaCO3 were better than those of Fe2 (SO4)3.","1510":"These findings suggest that interventions, including the fourth RTS,S dose, that protect vaccinated individuals during the potential rebound period should be implemented for high-transmission settings.RTS,S\/AS01 is the first malaria vaccine to be approved and recommended for widespread implementation by the World Health Organization (WHO). Trials reported lower vaccine efficacies in higher-incidence sites, potentially due to a \"rebound\" in malaria cases in vaccinated children. When naturally acquired protection in the control group rises and vaccine protection in the vaccinated wanes concurrently, malaria incidence can become greater in the vaccinated than in the control group, resulting in negative vaccine efficacies.Over time, incidence decreased in the control group and increased in the vaccine group. Three-dose efficacy in the lowest-transmission-intensity group (0.25 cases per person-year [CPPY]) decreased from 88.2% to 15.0% over 4.5 years, compared with 81.6% to -27.7% in the highest-transmission-intensity group (3 CPPY).Using data from the 2009-2014 phase III trial (NCT00866619) in Lilongwe, Malawi; Kintampo, Ghana; and Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9, Gabon, we evaluate this hypothesis by estimating malaria incidence in each vaccine group over time and in varying transmission settings. After estimating transmission intensities using ecological variables, we fit models with 3-way interactions between vaccination, time, and transmission intensity.","1511":"Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) and Black transgender women (BTW) are impacted by dual epidemics of HIV and incarceration. We advanced understanding of the relationship between criminal justice involvement, HIV, and other key HIV-related characteristics among these key populations in the US. We conducted a systematic review up to 2018 and 47 articles met the inclusion criteria of scientific publications involving quantitative findings of US-based HIV-related studies focused on criminal justice-involved (CJI) BMSM and BTW. Overall, there was a dearth of studies focused specifically on BTW. Criminal justice involvement was relatively high among BMSM and BTW and more pronounced among BTW. The current evidence favors no association between incarceration and HIV acquisition among BMSM with limited information about BTW. Criminal justice involvement was associated with a greater likelihood of STIs among BMSM with mixed results for sexual risk behaviors. Criminal justice settings served as an important venue for HIV testing\/diagnosis for both BMSM and BTW. However, these settings were not conducive for subsequent stages of the HIV care continuum. Studies pointed to an independent association between criminal justice involvement, substance use, housing instability, and greater odds of incarceration among BMSM who were unemployed and had limited education. Future incarceration was associated with high levels of perceived racism among BMSM. Among young BMSM, high network criminal justice prevalence was also associated with sexual risk behaviors, poorer mental health outcomes, drug use, and housing instability. CJI BMSM and BTW represent a critical subpopulation to end the HIV epidemic in the US.","1512":"State space models, including compartmental models, are used to model physical, biological and social phenomena in a broad range of scientific fields. A common way of representing the underlying processes in these models is as a system of stochastic processes which can be simulated forwards in time. Inference of model parameters based on observed time-series data can then be performed using sequential Monte Carlo techniques. However, using these methods for routine inference problems can be made difficult due to various engineering considerations: allowing model design to change in response to new data and ideas, writing model code which is highly performant, and incorporating all of this with up-to-date statistical techniques. Here, we describe a suite of packages in the R programming language designed to streamline the design and deployment of state space models, targeted at infectious disease modellers but suitable for other domains. Users describe their model in a familiar domain-specific language, which is converted into parallelised C++ code. A fast, parallel, reproducible random number generator is then used to run large numbers of model simulations in an efficient manner. We also provide standard inference and prediction routines, though the model simulator can be used directly if these do not meet the user's needs. These packages provide guarantees on reproducibility and performance, allowing the user to focus on the model itself, rather than the underlying computation. The ability to automatically generate high-performance code that would be tedious and time-consuming to write and verify manually, particularly when adding further structure to compartments, is crucial for infectious disease modellers. Our packages have been critical to the development cycle of our ongoing real-time modelling efforts in the COVID-19 pandemic, and have the potential to do the same for models used in a number of different domains.","1513":"Several major environmental programmes require regulated entities to measure and self-report pollutant levels to state regulatory agencies. This data is used to assess compliance, but critics suggest that it could be used more effectively to detect fraud in self-reports, a criminal offense. Efforts to develop and implement fraud detection tools are restricted by a lack of knowledge regarding how regulatory and enforcement systems operate in regulatory agencies and whether\/how data is used, particularly for fraud detection. To address this gap in knowledge, we conducted a case study of these issues in one state environmental agency. We triangulate interview, focus group and observational data to describe the current system and assess points in the system in which data is being used. We draw upon organisational learning theory to suggest the ways to use data more effectively in the future, particularly to improve fraud detection.","1514":"The U.S. COVID-19 Forecast Hub aggregates forecasts of the short-term burden of COVID-19 in the United States from many contributing teams. We study methods for building an ensemble that combines forecasts from these teams. These experiments have informed the ensemble methods used by the Hub. To be most useful to policy makers, ensemble forecasts must have stable performance in the presence of two key characteristics of the component forecasts: (1) occasional misalignment with the reported data, and (2) instability in the relative performance of component forecasters over time. Our results indicate that in the presence of these challenges, an untrained and robust approach to ensembling using an equally weighted median of all component forecasts is a good choice to support public health decision makers. In settings where some contributing forecasters have a stable record of good performance, trained ensembles that give those forecasters higher weight can also be helpful.","1515":"There has been an increased focus on the public health burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This raises conceptual challenges such as determining how much harm multi-drug resistant organisms do compared to what, or how to establish the burden. In this viewpoint we will present a counterfactual framework and provide guidance to harmonize methodologies and optimize study quality. In AMR burden studies, two counterfactual approaches have been applied; the harm of drug-resistant infections relative to the harm of the same, drug-susceptible, infections (susceptible-infection counterfactual) and the total harm of drug-resistant infections relative to a situation where such infections were prevented (no-infection counterfactual). We propose to use an intervention-based causal approach to determine the most appropriate counterfactual. We show that intervention scenarios, species of interest, and types of infections influence the choice of counterfactual. We recommend using purpose-designed cohort studies to apply this counterfactual framework, whereby the selection of cohorts (patients with drug-resistant, drug-susceptible and no-infection) should be based on matching on time to infection through exposure density sampling to avoid biased estimates. Application of survival methods is preferred, considering competing events. In conclusion, we advocate to estimate the burden of AMR using the no-infection and susceptible-infection counterfactuals. The resulting numbers will provide policy-relevant information about the upper and lower bound of future interventions designed to control AMR. The counterfactuals should be applied in cohort studies, whereby selection of the unexposed cohorts should be based on exposure density sampling, applying methods avoiding time-dependent bias and confounding.","1516":"The blockchain technology promises to transform finance, money and even governments. However, analyses of blockchain applicability and robustness typically focus on isolated systems whose actors contribute mainly by running the consensus algorithm. Here, we highlight the importance of considering trustless platforms within the broader ecosystem that includes social and communication networks. As an example, we analyse the flash-crash observed on 21st June 2017 in the Ethereum platform and show that a major phenomenon of social coordination led to a catastrophic cascade of events across several interconnected systems. We propose the concept of \u0093emergent centralisation\u0094 to describe situations where a single system becomes critically important for the functioning of the whole ecosystem, and argue that such situations are likely to become more and more frequent in interconnected socio-technical systems. We anticipate that the systemic approach we propose will have implications for future assessments of trustless systems and call for the attention of policy-makers on the fragility of our interconnected and rapidly changing world.","1517":"Cases were coinfected with HCV (78.5%) and HBV (12.9%). We identified 79 (37.8%) recent (<130 days) HIV infections. Phylogeny of 202 HIV env C2V3 sequences showed a 198-sample CRF01_AE strains cluster, with time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) in September 2013 (95% highest posterior density, August 2012-July 2014), and a peak of 15 infections\/day in September 2014. Three geospatial HIV hotspots were discernible in Roka and correlated with high exposure to the practitioner (P = .04). Fifty-nine of 153 (38.6%) tested cases showed recent (<180 days) HCV infections. Ninety HCV NS5B sequences formed 3 main clades, 1 containing 34 subtypes 1b with tMRCA in 2012, and 2 with 51 subtypes 6e and tMRCAs in 2002-2003.Unsafe injections in Cambodia most likely led to an explosive iatrogenic spreading of HIV, associated with a long-standing and more genetically diverse HCV propagation.In 2014-2015, 242 individuals aged 2-89 years were newly diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in Roka, a rural commune in Cambodia. A case-control study attributed the outbreak to unsafe injections. We aimed to reconstruct the likely transmission history of the outbreak.We assessed in 209 (86.4%) HIV-infected cases the presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV). We identified recent infections using antibody (Ab) avidity testing for HIV and HCV. We performed amplification, sequencing, and evolutionary phylogenetic analyses of viral strains. Geographical coordinates and parenteral exposure through medical services provided by an unlicensed healthcare practitioner were obtained from 193 cases and 1499 controls during interviews.","1518":"On January 20, 2020, the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in South Korea. After a rapid outbreak, the number of incident cases has been consistently decreasing since early March; this decrease has been widely attributed to its intensive testing. We report here on the likely role of social distancing in reducing transmission in South Korea. Our analysis suggests that transmission may still be persisting in some regions.","1519":"Following rapidly rising COVID-19 case numbers, England entered a national lockdown on 6 January 2021, with staged relaxations of restrictions from 8 March 2021 onwards.On average, risk of infection is proportional to infection prevalence. The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study is a repeat cross-sectional study of over 98,000 people every round (rounds approximately monthly) that estimates infection prevalence in England. We used Bayesian P-splines to estimate prevalence and the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) nationally, regionally and by age group from round 8 (beginning 6 January 2021) to round 13 (ending 12 July 2021) of REACT-1. As a comparator, a separate segmented-exponential model was used to quantify the impact on Rt of each relaxation of restrictions.Following an initial plateau of 1.54% until mid-January, infection prevalence decreased until 13 May when it reached a minimum of 0.09%, before increasing until the end of the study to 0.76%. Following the first easing of restrictions, which included schools reopening, the reproduction number Rt increased by 82% (55%, 108%), but then decreased by 61% (82%, 53%) at the second easing of restrictions, which was timed to match the Easter school holidays. Following further relaxations of restrictions, the observed Rt increased steadily, though the increase due to these restrictions being relaxed was offset by the effects of vaccination and also affected by the rapid rise of Delta. There was a high degree of synchrony in the temporal patterns of prevalence between regions and age groups.High-resolution prevalence data fitted to P-splines allowed us to show that the lockdown was effective at reducing risk of infection with school holidays\/closures playing a significant part.We characterise how the lockdown and subsequent easing of restrictions affected trends in SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence.","1520":"Demonstrating feasibility in small rural communities, local PC CARES facilitators hosted 59 two to three hour learning circles with 535 participants (376 unique). Local facilitators achieved acceptable fidelity to the model (80%), and interpreted the research accurately 81% of the time. Discussions reflected participants' understanding of the research content and its use in their lives. Participants showed positive changes in perceived knowledge, skills, and attitudes and strengthened their 'community of practice' from baseline to follow-up. Social network analyses indicate PC CARES had social impact, sustaining and enhancing prevention activities of non-participants who were 'close to' participants. These close associates were more likely take preventive actions than other non-participants after the intervention.This study evaluates the process and preliminary outcomes of Promoting Community Conversations About Research to End Suicide (PC CARES), an intervention that brings key stakeholders together so they can discuss suicide prevention research and find ways to put it into practice. Originally piloted in remote and rural Alaskan communities, the approach shows promise.PC CARES offers a practical, scalable method for community-based translation of research evidence into selfdetermined, culturally-responsive suicide prevention practice.Using a multi-method design, the study describes a series of locally-facilitated \"learning circles\" over 15 months and their preliminary results. Sign-in sheets documented participation. Transcriptions of audio-recorded sessions captured facilitator fidelity, accuracy, and the dominant themes of community discussions. Linked participant surveys (n=83) compared attendees' perceived knowledge, skills, attitudes, and their 'community of practice' at baseline and follow-up. A cross-sectional design compared 112 participants' with 335 non-participants' scores on knowledge and prevention behaviors, and considered the social impact with social network analyses.","1521":"Whereas the number of people newly infected by HIV is continuing to decline globally, the epidemic continues to expand in many parts of the world. As the HIV\/AIDS epidemic has matured in many countries, it is believed that the proportion of new infections occurring within couples has risen. Across countries, including Mozambique, a sizeable proportion of couples with HIV infection are discordant. A serodiscordant couple is a couple in which one partner has tested positive for HIV and the other has not. To describe the HIV serodiscordance among couples, a variety of association measures can be used. In this paper, we propose the serodiscordance measure (SDM) as a new alternative measure. Focus is on the specification of flexible marginal and random effects models for multivariate correlated binary data together with a full-likelihood estimation method, to adequately and directly describe the measure of interest. Fitting joint models allows examining the effects of different risk factors and other covariates on the probability to be HIV positive for each member within a couple, and estimating common effects for both probabilities more efficiently, while accounting for the association between their infection status. Moreover, the interpretation of the proposed association parameter SDM is more direct and relevant and effects of covariates can be studied as well. Results show that the HIV prevalence for the province where a couple was located as well as the union number for the woman within a couple are factors associated with HIV serodiscordance. These findings are important for the Mozambican public health policy makers to design national prevention plans, which include policies to stimulate regular HIV testing for couples as well as adolescents and young adults, prior to getting married or living together as a couple.","1522":"To assess the case fatality risk (CFR) of COVID-19 in mainland China, stratified by region and clinical category, and estimate key time-to-event intervals.Our CFR estimates based on laboratory-confirmed cases ascertained in mainland China suggest that COVID-19 is more severe than the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in hospitalized patients, particularly in Wuhan. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the severity of the first wave of the pandemic in China. Our estimates can help inform models and the global response to COVID-19.We analyzed 82,719 laboratory-confirmed cases reported in mainland China, including 4,632 deaths, and 77,029 discharges. The estimated CFR was 5.65% (95%CI: 5.50%-5.81%) nationally, with highest estimate in Wuhan (7.71%), and lowest in provinces outside Hubei (0.86%). The fatality risk among critical patients was 3.6 times that of all patients, and 0.8-10.3 fold higher than that of mild-to-severe patients. Older age (OR 1.14 per year; 95%CI: 1.11-1.16), and being male (OR 1.83; 95%CI: 1.10-3.04) were risk factors for mortality. The time from symptom onset to first healthcare consultation, time from symptom onset to laboratory confirmation, and time from symptom onset to hospitalization were consistently longer for deceased patients than for those who recovered.We collected individual information and aggregated data on COVID-19 cases from publicly available official sources from December 29, 2019 to April 17, 2020. We accounted for right-censoring to estimate the CFR and explored the risk factors for mortality. We fitted Weibull, gamma, and lognormal distributions to time-to-event data using maximum-likelihood estimation.","1523":"The survey spanned 17 waves deployed from June 1, 2020, to January 31, 2023, with a total of 408\u202f515 responses from 306\u202f799 respondents (mean [SD] age, 42.8 [13.0] years; 202\u202f416 women [66.0%]). Overall, 64\u202f946 respondents (15.9%) self-reported a test-confirmed COVID-19 infection. National survey-weighted test-confirmed COVID-19 estimates were strongly correlated with institutionally reported COVID-19 infections (Pearson correlation, r\u2009=\u20090.96; P\u2009<\u2009.001) from April 2020 to January 2022 (50-state correlation mean [SD] value, r\u2009=\u20090.88 [0.07]). This was before the government-led mass distribution of at-home rapid tests. After January 2022, correlation was diminished and no longer statistically significant (r\u2009=\u20090.55; P\u2009=\u2009.08; 50-state correlation mean [SD] value, r\u2009=\u20090.48 [0.23]). In contrast, survey COVID-19 estimates correlated highly with SARS-CoV-2 viral concentrations in wastewater both before (r\u2009=\u20090.92; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and after (r\u2009=\u20090.89; P\u2009<\u2009.001) January 2022. Institutionally reported COVID-19 cases correlated (r\u2009=\u20090.79; P\u2009<\u2009.001) with wastewater viral concentrations before January 2022, but poorly (r\u2009=\u20090.31; P\u2009=\u2009.35) after, suggesting that both survey and wastewater estimates may have better captured test-confirmed COVID-19 infections after January 2022. Consistent correlation patterns were observed at the state level. Based on national-level survey estimates, approximately 54 million COVID-19 cases were likely unaccounted for in official records between January 2022 and January 2023.This study suggests that nonprobability survey data can be used to estimate the temporal evolution of test-confirmed infections during an emerging disease outbreak. Self-reporting tools may enable government and health care officials to implement accessible and affordable at-home testing for efficient infection monitoring in the future.Identifying and tracking new infections during an emerging pandemic is crucial to design and deploy interventions to protect populations and mitigate the pandemic's effects, yet it remains a challenging task.To characterize the ability of nonprobability online surveys to longitudinally estimate the number of COVID-19 infections in the population both in the presence and absence of institutionalized testing.The main outcomes were (1) survey-weighted estimates of new monthly confirmed COVID-19 cases in the US from January 2020 to January 2023 and (2) estimates of uncounted test-confirmed cases from February 1, 2022, to January 1, 2023. These estimates were compared with institutionally reported COVID-19 infections collected by Johns Hopkins University and wastewater viral concentrations for SARS-CoV-2 from Biobot Analytics.Internet-based online nonprobability surveys were conducted among residents aged 18 years or older across 50 US states and the District of Columbia, using the PureSpectrum survey vendor, approximately every 6 weeks between June 1, 2020, and January 31, 2023, for a multiuniversity consortium-the COVID States Project.

Little is known about whether inequalities in severe disease and deaths, observed globally among minoritised ethnic groups, relates to greater infection risk, poorer prognosis, or both. We analysed global data on COVID-19 clinical outcomes examining inequalities between people from minoritised ethnic groups compared to the ethnic majority group.Our study suggests that systematic ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 health outcomes exist, with large differences in exposure risk and some differences in prognosis following hospitalisation. Response and recovery interventions must focus on tackling drivers of ethnic inequalities which increase exposure risk and vulnerabilities to severe disease, including structural racism and racial discrimination.77 studies comprising over 200,000,000 participants were included. Compared with White majority populations, we observed an increased risk of testing positive for infection for people from Black (adjusted Risk Ratio [aRR]:1.78, 95% CI:1.59-1.99, I2\u00a0=\u00a099.1), South Asian (aRR:3.00, 95% CI:1.59-5.66, I2\u00a0=\u00a099.1), Mixed (aRR:1.64, 95% CI:1.02-1.67, I2\u00a0=\u00a093.2) and Other ethnic groups (aRR:1.36, 95% CI:1.01-1.82, I2\u00a0=\u00a085.6). Black, Hispanic, and South Asian people were more likely to be seropositive. Among population-based studies, Black and Hispanic ethnic groups and Indigenous peoples had an increased risk of hospitalisation; Black, Hispanic, South Asian, East Asian and Mixed ethnic groups and Indigenous peoples had an increased risk of ICU admission. Mortality risk was increased for Hispanic, Mixed, and Indigenous groups. Smaller differences were seen for prognosis following infection. Following hospitalisation, South Asian, East Asian, Black and Mixed ethnic groups had an increased risk of ICU admission, and mortality risk was greater in Mixed ethnic groups. Certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate.ESRC:ES\/W000849\/1.Databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, EMCARE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library) were searched from 1st December 2019 to 3rd October 2022, for studies reporting original clinical data for COVID-19 outcomes disaggregated by ethnicity: infection, hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality. We assessed inequalities in incidence and prognosis using random-effects meta-analyses, with Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) use to assess certainty of findings. Meta-regressions explored the impact of region and time-frame (vaccine roll-out) on heterogeneity.

However, in many LMICs, traditional data sets on travel such as commuting surveys as well as non-traditional sources such as mobile phone data are lacking, or, where available, have only rarely been leveraged by the public health community. Evaluating the accuracy of available data to measure transmission-relevant travel may be further hampered by limited reporting of suspected and laboratory confirmed infections. Here, we leverage case data collected as part of a COVID-19 dashboard collated via daily reports from the Malagasy authorities on reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 across the 22 regions of Madagascar. We compare the order of the timing of when cases were reported with predictions from a SARS-CoV-2 metapopulation model of Madagascar informed using various measures of connectivity including a gravity model based on different measures of distance, Internal Migration Flow data, and mobile phone data. Overall, the models based on mobile phone connectivity and the gravity-based on Euclidean distance best predicted the observed spread. The ranks of the regions most remote from the capital were more difficult to predict but interestingly, regions where the mobile phone connectivity model was more accurate differed from those where the gravity model was most accurate. This suggests that there may be additional features of mobility or connectivity that were consistently underestimated using all approaches, but are epidemiologically relevant. This work highlights the importance of data availability and strengthening collaboration among different institutions with access to critical data - models are only as good as the data that they use, so building towards effective data-sharing pipelines is essential.","1527":"State-mandated school entry immunization requirements in the United States play an important role in achieving high vaccine coverage, but variations in vaccine exemption policies result in a patchwork of vaccine coverage across the country.Our work suggests that vaccination policies have significant impacts on patterns of herd immunity. Our findings can be used to develop evidence-based vaccine legislation.In this study, we evaluate epidemiological effects and spatial variations in nonmedical exemption (NME) rates in the context of vaccine policies. We first analyze the correlation between NME rates and vaccine coverage for 3 significant childhood vaccinations. Furthermore, we assess the effects of policy changes in a subset of states, using a correlative approach at the state level and performing a clustering analysis at the county level.We find that higher rates of exemptions are associated with lower vaccination rates of school-aged children in all cases. In a subset of states where exemption policy has recently changed, we show that the effects on statewide NME rates vary widely and that decreases in NMEs can lead to an increase in other types of exemptions. Finally, our clustering analysis in California, Illinois, and Connecticut shows that policy changes affect the spatial distribution of NMEs.","1528":"A variety of mechanistic and statistical methods to forecast seasonal influenza have been proposed and are in use; however, the effects of various data issues and design choices (statistical versus mechanistic methods, for example) on the accuracy of these approaches have not been thoroughly assessed. Here, we compare the accuracy of three forecasting approaches-a mechanistic method, a weighted average of two statistical methods and a super-ensemble of eight statistical and mechanistic models-in predicting seven outbreak characteristics of seasonal influenza during the 2016-2017 season at the national and 10 regional levels in the USA. For each of these approaches, we report the effects of real time under- and over-reporting in surveillance systems, use of non-surveillance proxies of influenza activity and manual override of model predictions on forecast quality. Our results suggest that a meta-ensemble of statistical and mechanistic methods has better overall accuracy than the individual methods. Supplementing surveillance data with proxy estimates generally improves the quality of forecasts and transient reporting errors degrade the performance of all three approaches considerably. The improvement in quality from ad hoc and post-forecast changes suggests that domain experts continue to possess information that is not being sufficiently captured by current forecasting approaches.","1529":"We present a multi-annual, individual-based, stochastic, force of infection model that accounts for individual exposure histories and disease\/vaccine dynamics influencing susceptibility. We simulate birth cohorts that experience yearly influenza epidemics and follow them until age 18 to determine attack rates and the number of infections during childhood. We perform simulations under baseline conditions, with an assumed vaccination coverage of 44%, to compare annual vaccination to no and biennial vaccination. We relax our baseline assumptions to explore how our model assumptions impact vaccination program performance. At baseline, we observed less than half the number of infections between the ages 2 and 10 under annual vaccination in children who had been vaccinated at least half the time compared to no vaccination. When averaged over all ages 0-18, the number of infections under annual vaccination was 2.07 (2.06, 2.08) compared to 2.63 (2.62, 2.64) under no vaccination, and 2.38 (2.37, 2.40) under biennial vaccination. When we introduced a penalty for repeated exposures, we observed a decrease in the difference in infections between the vaccination strategies. Specifically, the difference in childhood infections under biennial compared to annual vaccination decreased from 0.31 to 0.04 as exposure penalty increased.Many countries include annual vaccination of children against influenza in their vaccination programs. In the United Kingdom (UK), annual vaccination of children aged of 2 to 10 against influenza is recommended. However, little research has evaluated whether annual vaccination is the best strategy, while accounting for how past infection and vaccination may affect an individual's susceptibility to infection in the current influenza season. Prior work has suggested that there may be a negative effect of repeated vaccination. In this work we developed a stochastic, individual-based model to assess the impact of repeated vaccination strategies on childhood infections. Specifically, we first compare annual vaccination to no vaccination and then annual vaccination to biennial (every other year) vaccination. We use the UK as our motivating example. We found that an annual vaccination strategy resulted in the fewest childhood infections, followed by biennial vaccination. The difference in number of childhood infections between the different vaccination strategies decreased when we introduced a penalty for repeated exposures. Our work confirms the value of annual vaccination in children, but also shows that similar benefits of vaccination can be obtained by implementing a biennial vaccination program, particularly when there is a negative effect of repeated vaccinations.Annual vaccination of children against influenza is a key component of vaccination programs in many countries. However, past infection and vaccination may affect an individual's susceptibility to infection. Little research has evaluated whether annual vaccination is the best strategy. Using the United Kingdom as our motivating example, we developed a framework to assess the impact of different childhood vaccination strategies, specifically annual and biennial (every other year), on attack rate and expected number of infections.Our results indicate that while annual vaccination averts more childhood infections than biennial vaccination, this difference is small. Our work confirms the value of annual vaccination in children, even with modest vaccination coverage, but also shows that similar benefits of vaccination may be obtained by implementing a biennial vaccination program.","1530":"We investigated the relationship between individual-level social vulnerability and place of death during the infectious disease emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic in Massachusetts. Our research represents a unique contribution by matching individual-level death certificates with COVID-19 test data to analyse differences in distributions of place of death.","1531":"Genetic data can provide insights into population history, but first we must understand the patterns that complex histories leave in genomes. Here, we consider the admixed human population of Cabo Verde to understand the patterns of genetic variation left by social and demographic processes. First settled in the late 1400s, Cabo Verdeans are admixed descendants of Portuguese colonizers and enslaved West African people. We consider Cabo Verde's well-studied historical record alongside genome-wide SNP data from 563 individuals from 4 regions within the archipelago. We use genetic ancestry to test for patterns of nonrandom mating and sex-specific gene flow, and we examine the consequences of these processes for common demographic inference methods and for genetic patterns. Notably, multiple population genetic tools that assume random mating underestimate the timing of admixture, but incorporating non-random mating produces estimates more consistent with historical records. We consider how admixture interrupts common summaries of genomic variation such as runs-of-homozygosity (ROH). While summaries of ROH may be difficult to interpret in admixed populations, differentiating ROH by length class shows that ROH reflect historical differences between the islands in their contributions from the source populations and post-admixture population dynamics. Finally, we find higher African ancestry on the X chromosome than on the autosomes, consistent with an excess of European males and African females contributing to the gene pool. Considering these genomic insights into population history in the context of Cabo Verde's historical record, we can identify how assumptions in genetic models impact inference of population history more broadly.","1532":"Epidemiological studies aim at predicting the outbreak of diseases as epidemics and pandemics. This goal is often realized using closed form expressions that significantly utilize systems of differential equations. These systems of equations are often derived by groups of researchers working in global collaborative efforts. However, groups of researchers can experience a high workload in scenarios when there is large number of non\u2013active participating researchers in a collaborative study. In addition, data explosion and increased availability can also undermine the efforts of hardworking researchers. This is because of the high velocity and variety associated with big data availability. Hence, an approach that helps researchers to address these challenges is required. The discussion in this research proposes a suitable solution in this regard. The proposed solution introduces the notion of cognitive epidemiology and epidemiological crawlers in a novel computing framework. In the proposed computing framework, crawlers and existing closed form expressions used in epidemiological studies interact. Prior to this interaction, epidemiological closed form expressions are formatted in a manner to enable the incorporation of intelligence capability. The research presents execution paths and discusses the incorporation alongside the integration of the proposed mechanism in a manner suitable for integration with the internet.","1533":"Loss of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) has been found to contribute to pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) proliferation and pulmonary arterial remodeling therefore the development of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying PPAR\u03b3 reduction in PASMC remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that leptin dose- and time-dependently inducued PPAR\u03b3 down-regulation and proliferation of primary cultured rat PASMC, this was accompanied with the activation of extracellular regulated kinase1\/2 (ERK1\/2) signaling pathway and subsequent induction of early growth response-1 (Egr-1) expression. The presence of MEK inhibitors U0126 or PD98059, or prior silencing Egr-1 with small interfering RNA suppressed leptin-induced PPAR\u03b3 reduction. In addition, activation of PPAR\u03b3 by pioglitazone or targeting ERK1\/2\/Egr-1 suppressed leptin-induced PASMC proliferation. Taken together, our study indicates that ERK1\/2 signaling pathway-mediated leptin-induced PPAR\u03b3 reduction and PASMC proliferation through up-regulation of Egr-1 and suggests that targeting leptin\/ERK1\/2\/Egr-1 pathway might have potential value in ameliorating vascular remodeling and benefit PH.","1534":"The Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) Center for Causal Discovery is developing and disseminating an integrated set of open source tools that support causal modeling and discovery of biomedical knowledge from large and complex biomedical datasets.

","1535":"Health system data incompletely capture the social risk factors for drug overdose. This study aimed to improve the accuracy of a machine-learning algorithm to predict opioid overdose risk by integrating human services and criminal justice data with health claims data to capture the social determinants of overdose risk. This prognostic study included Medicaid beneficiaries (n = 237,259) in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania enrolled between 2015 and 2018, randomly divided into training, testing, and validation samples. We measured 290 potential predictors (239 derived from Medicaid claims data) in 30-day periods, beginning with the first observed Medicaid enrollment date during the study period. Using a gradient boosting machine, we predicted a composite outcome (i.e., fatal or nonfatal opioid overdose constructed using medical examiner and claims data) in the subsequent month. We compared prediction performance between a Medicaid claims only model to one integrating human services and criminal justice data with Medicaid claims (i.e., integrated model) using several metrics (e.g., C-statistic, number needed to evaluate [NNE] to identify one overdose). Beneficiaries were stratified into risk-score decile subgroups. The samples (training = 79,087, testing = 79,086, validation = 79,086) had similar characteristics (age = 38\u00b118 years, female = 56%, white = 48%, having at least one overdose = 1.7% during study period). Using the validation sample, the integrated model slightly improved on the Medicaid claims only model (C-statistic = 0.885; 95%CI = 0.877-0.892 vs. C-statistic = 0.871; 95%CI = 0.863-0.878), with small corresponding improvements in the NNE and positive predictive value. Nine of the top 30 most important predictors in the integrated model were human services and criminal justice variables. Using the integrated model, approximately 70% of individuals with overdoses were members of the top risk decile (overdose rates in the subsequent month = 47\/10,000 beneficiaries). Few individuals in the bottom 9 deciles had overdose episodes (0-12\/10,000). Machine-learning algorithms integrating claims and social service and criminal justice data modestly improved opioid overdose prediction among Medicaid beneficiaries for a large U.S. county heavily affected by the opioid crisis.","1536":"To assess the differential impact of a copayment exemption compared to a cash incentive on increasing skilled birth attendance (i.e., birth attended by a skilled health worker) in Nepal.Skilled birth attendance in districts with both interventions was no higher on average than in districts with only the cash incentive. In areas with adequate road networks, however, significantly higher skilled birth attendance was observed in districts with both interventions compared to those with only the cash incentive.Twenty-five districts received both the policy interventions, and the remaining 50 control districts received only the cash incentive. We employed a difference-in-differences model to compare children born in districts with both interventions to those in districts with conditional cash transfers only. Average marginal effects of the difference-in-difference coefficient on skilled birth attendance measures are estimated.The added incentive of the user-fee exemption did not significantly increase skilled birth attendance relative to the presence of the cash incentive. User-fee exemptions may not be effective in areas with inadequate road infrastructure.This study used data on 8,785 children born between July 2005 and December 2008, obtained from the nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys, 2006 and 2011.","1537":" Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an understudied threat to human health. During the 2015 chikungunya epidemic in Managua, Nicaragua, we estimated the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic CHIKV infections, which is important for understanding transmission dynamics and the public health impact of CHIKV. This index cluster study identified and monitored persons at risk of infection, enabling capture of asymptomatic infections. We estimated that 31 (49%) of 63 at-risk participants had asymptomatic CHIKV infections, which is significantly outside the 3% to 28% range reported in literature reviews. However, recent seroprevalence studies, including two large pediatric cohort studies in the same setting, had also found percentages of inapparent infections outside the 3% to 28% range. Bayesian and simulation analyses, informed by a systematic literature search, revealed that the percentage of inapparent infections in epidemic settings varies by CHIKV phylogenetic lineage. Our study quantifies and provides the first epidemiological evidence that chikungunya epidemic characteristics are strongly influenced by CHIKV lineage.","1538":"Slow roll-out at 30% coverage largely targets those over 50 years and resulted in 54% fewer deaths (8132 (7914-8373)) than no vaccination and was cost saving (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, ICER=US$-1343 (US$-1345 to US$-1341) per disability-adjusted life-year, DALY averted). Increasing coverage to 50% and 70%, further reduced deaths by 12% (810 (757-872) and 5% (282 (251-317) but was not cost-effective, using Kenya's cost-effectiveness threshold (US$919.11). Rapid roll-out with 30% coverage averted 63% more deaths and was more cost-saving (ICER=US$-1607 (US$-1609 to US$-1604) per DALY averted) compared with slow roll-out at the same coverage level, but 50% and 70% coverage scenarios were not cost-effective.A few studies have assessed the epidemiological impact and the cost-effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in settings where most of the population had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection.We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of COVID-19 vaccine in Kenya from a societal perspective over a 1.5-year time frame. An age-structured transmission model assumed at least 80% of the population to have prior natural immunity when an immune escape variant was introduced. We examine the effect of slow (18 months) or rapid (6 months) vaccine roll-out with vaccine coverage of 30%, 50% or 70% of the adult (>18 years) population prioritising roll-out in those over 50-years (80% uptake in all scenarios). Cost data were obtained from primary analyses. We assumed vaccine procurement at US$7 per dose and vaccine delivery costs of US$3.90-US$6.11 per dose. The cost-effectiveness threshold was US$919.11.With prior exposure partially protecting much of the Kenyan population, vaccination of young adults may no longer be cost-effective.","1539":"The generation time distribution, reflecting the time between successive infections in transmission chains, is a key epidemiological parameter for describing COVID-19 transmission dynamics. However, because exact infection times are rarely known, it is often approximated by the serial interval distribution. This approximation holds under the assumption that infectors and infectees share the same incubation period distribution, which may not always be true. We estimated incubation period and serial interval distributions using 629 transmission pairs reconstructed by investigating 2989 confirmed cases in China in January-February 2020, and developed an inferential framework to estimate the generation time distribution that accounts for variation over time due to changes in epidemiology, sampling biases and public health and social measures. We identified substantial reductions over time in the serial interval and generation time distributions. Our proposed method provides more reliable estimation of the temporal variation in the generation time distribution, improving assessment of transmission dynamics.","1540":"The results presented point to a dynamic gut microbiome in Gorilla spp., associated with ontogeny and individual development. Of note, the gut microbiomes of breastfeeding infants seemed to reflect early exposure to complex, herbaceous vegetation. Whether increased compositional complexity of the infant gorilla gut microbiome is an adaptive response to an energy-limited diet and an underdeveloped gut needs to be further tested. Overall, age and sex based gut microbiome differences, as shown here, maybe mainly attributed to access to specific feeding sources, and social interactions between individuals within groups.Publicly available 16S rRNA data generated from fecal samples of different groups of Gorilla gorilla gorilla in the Central African Republic were downloaded and bioinformatically processed. The groups analyzed included habituated, partially habituated and unhabituated gorillas, sampled during low fruit (dry, n\u2009=\u200928) and high fruit (wet, n\u2009=\u200982) seasons. Microbial community analyses (alpha and beta diversity and analyses of discriminant taxa), in tandem with network-wide approaches, were used to (a) mine for specific age and sex based differences in gut bacterial community composition and to (b) asses for gut community modularity and bacterial taxa with potential functional roles, in the context of seasonal food variation, and social group affiliation.Both age and sex significantly influenced gut microbiome diversity and composition in wild western lowland gorillas. However, the largest differences were observed between infants and adults in habituated groups and between adults and immature gorillas within all groups, and across dry and wet seasons. Specifically, although adults always showed greater bacterial richness than infants and immature gorillas, network-wide analyses showed higher microbial community complexity and modularity in the infant gorilla gut. Sex-based microbiome differences were not evident among adults, being only detected among immature gorillas.Environmental and ecological factors, such as geographic range, anthropogenic pressure, group identity, and feeding behavior are known to influence the gastrointestinal microbiomes of great apes. However, the influence of individual host traits such as age and sex, given specific dietary and social constraints, has been less studied. The objective of this investigation was to determine the associations between an individual's age and sex on the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome in wild western lowland gorillas.","1541":"Drug poisoning mortality rates have risen an average of 6% per year since 1979. Increases are occurring in all ages 15+, and in all race-sex groups. HIDTA counties with the highest mortality rates were in Appalachia and New Mexico. Many of the HIDTA border counties had lower rates of mortality.The drug poisoning mortality epidemic is continuing to grow. While HIDTA resources are appropriately targeted at many areas in the US most affected, rates are also rapidly rising in some non-HIDTA areas.Crude and age-adjusted death rates were formed for age group, race, sex, and county for accidental poisonings (ICD 9th revision: E850-E869; ICD 10th revision: X40-X49) from 1979 to 2014 using the Mortality and Population Data System housed at the University of Pittsburgh. Rate ratios were calculated comparing rates from 2014 to 1979, overall, by sex, age group, race, and county. Joinpoint regression detected changes in trends and calculated the average annual percentage change (AAPC) as a summary measure of trend.The purpose of this study was to examine US accidental poisoning death rates by demographic and geographic factors from 1979 to 2014, including High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas.","1542":"A Markov decision analysis model was created for VSP and FHR based on literature review and institutional data over a 35-year time horizon. Model parameters were derived and averaged from systematic review and institutional experience. VSP cost and surgical time saving was incorporated. We accounted for long-term risks including cancer recurrence and hardware failure\/exposure. We calculated cost in US dollars and effectiveness in quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs). A health care perspective was adopted, discounting costs and effectiveness at 3%\/year. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses tested model robustness.VSP is economically favorable compared to FHR in patients requiring mandibular reconstruction for advanced oral cancer, but these results are sensitive to the patient's age at diagnosis and the institutional VSP cost. Our results do not suggest if one \"should or should not\" use VSP, rather, emphasizes the need for patient selection regarding which patients would most benefit from VSP when evaluating quality of life and long-term complications. Further studies are necessary to demonstrate improved long-term risk for hardware failure\/exposure in VSP compared to FHR.This study is an economic evaluation comparing virtual surgical planning (VSP) utilization to free hand mandibular reconstruction (FHR) for advanced oral cavity cancer, for which the cost effectiveness remains poorly understood. The proposed clinical benefits of VSP must be weighed against the additional upfront costs.In the base case scenario, total VSP strategy cost was $49,498 with 8.37 QALYs gained while FHR cost was $42,478 with 8.27 QALY gained. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), or the difference in cost\/difference in effectiveness, for VSP was calculated at $68,382\/QALY gained. VSP strategy favorability was sensitive to variations of patient age at diagnosis and institutional VSP cost with one-way sensitivity analysis. VSP was less economically favorable for patients >75.5\u2009years of age or for institutional VSP costs >$10,745. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 55% of iterations demonstrated an ICER value below a $100,000\/QALY threshold.","1543":"Experiments showed that [Formula: see text] accurately measures the dissimilarity between contigs of metagenomic reads and that relative sequence composition is more reasonable to bin the contigs. The [Formula: see text] can be applied to any existing contig-binning tools for single metagenomic samples to obtain better binning results.According to previous studies, relative sequence compositions are similar across different regions of the same genome, but they differ between distinct genomes. Generally, current tools have used the normalized frequency of k-tuples directly, but this represents an absolute, not relative, sequence composition. Therefore, we attempted to model contigs using relative k-tuple composition, followed by measuring dissimilarity between contigs using [Formula: see text]. The [Formula: see text] was designed to measure the dissimilarity between two long sequences or Next-Generation Sequencing data with the Markov models of the background genomes. This method was effective in revealing group and gradient relationships between genomes, metagenomes and metatranscriptomes. With many binning tools available, we do not try to bin contigs from scratch. Instead, we developed [Formula: see text] to adjust contigs among bins based on the output of existing binning tools for a single metagenomic sample. The tool is taxonomy-free and depends only on k-tuples. To evaluate the performance of [Formula: see text], five widely used binning tools with different strategies of sequence composition or the hybrid of sequence composition and abundance were selected to bin six synthetic and real datasets, after which [Formula: see text] was applied to adjust the binning results.

The vital rates of these ectothermic vectors and parasites respond strongly and nonlinearly to temperature and therefore to climate change. Here, we review how trait-based approaches can synthesise and mechanistically predict the temperature dependence of transmission across vectors, pathogens, and environments. We present 11 pathogens transmitted by 15 different mosquito species - including globally important diseases like malaria, dengue, and Zika - synthesised from previously published studies. Transmission varied strongly and unimodally with temperature, peaking at 23-29\u00baC and declining to zero below 9-23\u00baC and above 32-38\u00baC. Different traits restricted transmission at low versus high temperatures, and temperature effects on transmission varied by both mosquito and parasite species. Temperate pathogens exhibit broader thermal ranges and cooler thermal minima and optima than tropical pathogens. Among tropical pathogens, malaria and Ross River virus had lower thermal optima (25-26\u00baC) while dengue and Zika viruses had the highest (29\u00baC)\u00a0thermal optima. We expect warming to increase transmission below thermal optima but decrease transmission above optima. Key directions for future work include linking mechanistic models to field transmission, combining temperature effects with control measures, incorporating trait variation and temperature variation, and investigating climate adaptation and migration.","1546":"In Wuhan, strict disease control measures were implemented 6 weeks after sustained local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Between January 10 and February 29, 2020, patients with COVID-19 accounted for a median (interquartile range) of 429 (25-1143) patients in the ICU and 1521 (111-7202) inpatients with serious illness each day. During the epidemic peak, 19\u202f425 patients (24.5 per 10\u202f000 adults) were hospitalized, 9689 (12.2 per 10\u202f000 adults) were considered in serious condition, and 2087 (2.6 per 10\u202f000 adults) needed critical care per day. In Guangzhou, strict disease control measures were implemented within 1 week of case importation. Between January 24 and February 29, COVID-19 accounted for a median (interquartile range) of 9 (7-12) patients in the ICU and 17 (15-26) inpatients with serious illness each day. During the epidemic peak, 15 patients were in critical condition and 38 were classified as having serious illness. The projected number of prevalent critically ill patients at the peak of a Wuhan-like outbreak in US cities was estimated to range from 2.2 to 4.4 per 10\u202f000 adults, depending on differences in age distribution and comorbidity (ie, hypertension) prevalence.This comparative effectiveness study analyzed the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Guangzhou, China, from January 10 to February 29, 2020.Timing of disease control measures relative to timing of SARS-CoV-2 community spread.Number of critical and severe patient-days and peak number of patients with critical and severe illness during the study period.Sustained spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has happened in major US cities.

Due to the economic impacts of social distancing, there is growing desire to relax these measures. To characterize a range of possible strategies for control and to understand their consequences, we performed an optimal control analysis of a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Given that the pandemic is already underway and controls have already been initiated, we calibrated our model to data from the USA and focused our analysis on optimal controls from May 2020 through December 2021. We found that a major factor that differentiates strategies that prioritize lives saved versus reduced time under control is how quickly control is relaxed once social distancing restrictions expire in May 2020. Strategies that maintain control at a high level until at least summer 2020 allow for tapering of control thereafter and minimal deaths, whereas strategies that relax control in the short term lead to fewer options for control later and a higher likelihood of exceeding hospital capacity. Our results also highlight that the potential scope for controlling COVID-19 until a vaccine is available depends on epidemiological parameters about which there is still considerable uncertainty, including the basic reproduction number and the effectiveness of social distancing. In light of those uncertainties, our results do not constitute a quantitative forecast and instead provide a qualitative portrayal of possible outcomes from alternative approaches to control.","1548":"Recommending both the conjugate and polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines to all U.S. seniors may have little public health impact and be economically unreasonable. Public health impact and cost-effectiveness of using both vaccines in all adults aged \u226565 years were estimated compared with an alternative strategy (omitting pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the nonimmunocompromised) and with the newly revised recommendation (giving or omitting conjugate vaccine based on patient-physician shared decision making).A vaccination strategy that omits pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in immunocompetent U.S. seniors may be economically reasonable, particularly for black seniors. Use of both pneumococcal vaccines was more effective but substantially more expensive.Strategies were examined in hypothetical U.S. 65-year-old population cohorts and segmented into health states based on age- and population-specific data in a Markov state-transition model with a lifetime time horizon from a healthcare perspective. Black population cohorts were examined separately given greater illness risk and lower vaccine uptake. Model parameters came from the Centers for Disease Control Active Core Bacterial Surveillance network, National Health Interview Survey, and Nationwide Inpatient Sample data. Outcomes included incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year gained and pneumococcal disease outcomes for each strategy. Data were gathered and analysis performed in 2018.Giving both vaccines, either routinely or with shared decision making, was most effective, reducing pneumococcal disease incidence compared with no vaccination, but costing $765,000-$2.18 million\/quality-adjusted life year gained. Depending on examined population and scenario, the alternative strategy cost $65,700-$226,700\/quality-adjusted life year gained (less in black populations) and reduced cases and deaths by 0.3%-0.9%.","1549":"The United States experienced historically high numbers of measles cases in 2019, despite achieving national measles vaccination rates above the World Health Organization recommendation of 95% coverage with two doses. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, resulting in suspension of many clinical preventive services, pediatric vaccination rates in the United States have fallen precipitously, dramatically increasing risk of measles resurgence. Previous research has shown that measles outbreaks in high-coverage contexts are driven by spatial clustering of nonvaccination, which decreases local immunity below the herd immunity threshold. However, little is known about how to best conduct surveillance and target interventions to detect and address these high-risk areas, and most vaccination data are reported at the state-level-a resolution too coarse to detect community-level clustering of nonvaccination characteristic of recent outbreaks. In this paper, we perform a series of computational experiments to assess the impact of clustered nonvaccination on outbreak potential and magnitude of bias in predicting disease risk posed by measuring vaccination rates at coarse spatial scales. We find that, when nonvaccination is locally clustered, reporting aggregate data at the state- or county-level can result in substantial underestimates of outbreak risk. The COVID-19 pandemic has shone a bright light on the weaknesses in US infectious disease surveillance and a broader gap in our understanding of how to best use detailed spatial data to interrupt and control infectious disease transmission. Our research clearly outlines that finer-scale vaccination data should be collected to prevent a return to endemic measles transmission in the United States.","1550":"Nitrogen oxides (NOx) play a central role in catalyzing tropospheric ozone formation. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) has recently reemerged as a key target for air pollution control measures, and observational evidence points toward a limited understanding of ozone in high-NOx environments. A complete understanding of the mechanisms controlling the rapid atmospheric cycling between ozone (O3)-nitric oxide (NO)-NO2 in high-NOx regimes at the surface is therefore paramount but remains challenging because of competing dynamical and chemical effects. Here, we present long-term eddy covariance measurements of O3, NO, and NO2, over an urban area, that allow disentangling important physical and chemical processes. When generalized, our findings suggest that the depositional O3 flux near the surface in urban environments is negligible compared to the flux caused by chemical conversion of O3. This leads to an underestimation of the Leighton ratio and is a key process for modulating urban NO2 mixing ratios. As a consequence, primary NO2 emissions have been significantly overestimated.","1551":"Affordable point-of-care tests for hepatitis C (HCV) viraemia are needed to improve access to treatment in low- and middle-income countries. Our aims were to determine the target limit of detection (LOD) necessary to diagnose the majority of people with HCV eligible for treatment, and identify characteristics associated with low-level viraemia (LLV) (defined as the lowest 3% of the distribution of HCV RNA) to understand those at risk of being misdiagnosed.In this global dataset, a test with an LOD of 1,318\u202fIU\/ml would identify 97% of viraemic HCV infections among almost all populations. This LOD will help guide manufacturers in the development of affordable point-of-care diagnostics to expand HCV testing and linkage to care in low- and middle-income countries.The dataset included 66,640 individuals with HCV viraemia from across the world. The LOD for the 95th and 99th percentiles were 3,311\u202fIU\/ml and 214\u202fIU\/ml. The LOD for the 97th percentile was 1,318\u202fIU\/ml (95% CI 1,298.4-1,322.3). Factors associated with LLV, defined as HCV RNA\u202f<1,318\u202fIU\/ml, were younger age 18-30 vs. 51-64\u202fyears (odds ratios [OR] 2.56; 95% CI 2.19-2.99), female vs. male sex (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.18-1.49), and advanced fibrosis stage F4 vs. F0-1 (OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.21-1.69). Only the younger age group had a decreased relative sensitivity below 95%, at 93.3%.We created and analysed a dataset from 12 countries with 66,640 participants with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. We determined that about 97% of those with viraemic infection had 1,300\u202fIU\/ml or more of circulating virus at the time of diagnosis. While current diagnostic tests can detect as little as 12\u202fIU\/ml of virus, our findings suggest that increasing the level of detection closer to 1,300\u202fIU\/ml would maintain good test accuracy and will likely enable development of more affordable portable tests for use in low- and middle-income countries.We established a multi-country cross-sectional dataset of first available quantitative HCV RNA measurements linked to demographic and clinical data. We excluded individuals on HCV treatment. We analysed the distribution of HCV RNA and determined critical thresholds for detection of HCV viraemia. We then performed logistic regression to evaluate factors associated with LLV, and derived relative sensitivities for significant covariates.","1552":"During COVID-19, governments and the public are fighting not only a pandemic but also a co-evolving infodemic-the rapid and far-reaching spread of information of questionable quality. We analysed more than 100 million Twitter messages posted worldwide during the early stages of epidemic spread across countries (from 22 January to 10 March 2020) and classified the reliability of the news being circulated. We developed an Infodemic Risk Index to capture the magnitude of exposure to unreliable news across countries. We found that measurable waves of potentially unreliable information preceded the rise of COVID-19 infections, exposing entire countries to falsehoods that pose a serious threat to public health. As infections started to rise, reliable information quickly became more dominant, and Twitter content shifted towards more credible informational sources. Infodemic early-warning signals provide important cues for misinformation mitigation by means of adequate communication strategies.","1553":"Despite the remarkable progress that has been made to reduce global malaria mortality by 29% in the past 5 years, malaria is still a serious global health problem. Inadequate diagnostics is one of the major obstacles in fighting the disease. An automated system for malaria diagnosis can help to make malaria screening faster and more reliable. We present an automated system to detect and segment red blood cells (RBCs) and identify infected cells in Wright\u0096Giemsa stained thin blood smears. Specifically, using image analysis and machine learning techniques, we process digital images of thin blood smears to determine the parasitemia in each smear. We use a cell extraction method to segment RBCs, in particular overlapping cells. We show that a combination of RGB color and texture features outperforms other features. We evaluate our method on microscopic blood smear images from human and mouse and show that it outperforms other techniques. For human cells, we measure an absolute error of 1.18% between the true and the automatic parasite counts. For mouse cells, our automatic counts correlate well with expert and flow cytometry counts. This makes our system the first one to work for both human and mouse.","1554":"Not all persons infected with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) develop severe symptoms, which likely leads to an underestimation of the number of people infected and an overestimation of the severity. To estimate the number of MERS-CoV infections that have occurred in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we applied a statistical model to a line list describing 721 MERS-CoV infections detected between June 7, 2012, and July 25, 2014. We estimated that 1,528 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1,327, 1,883) MERS-CoV infections occurred in this interval, which is 2.1 (95% CI: 1.8, 2.6) times the number reported. The probability of developing symptoms ranged from 11% (95% CI: 4, 25) in persons under 10 years of age to 88% (95% CI: 72, 97) in those 70 years of age or older. An estimated 22% (95% CI: 18, 25) of those infected with MERS-CoV died. MERS-CoV is deadly, but this work shows that its clinical severity differs markedly between groups and that many cases likely go undiagnosed. ","1555":"There is growing evidence that weather alters SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but it remains unclear what drives the phenomenon. One prevailing hypothesis is that people spend more time indoors in cooler weather, leading to increased spread of SARS-CoV-2 related to time spent in confined spaces and close contact with others. However, the evidence in support of that hypothesis is limited and, at times, conflicting. We use a mediation framework, and combine daily weather, COVID-19 hospital surveillance, cellphone-based mobility data and building footprints to estimate the relationship between daily indoor and outdoor weather conditions, mobility, and COVID-19 hospitalizations. We quantify the direct health impacts of weather on COVID-19 hospitalizations and the indirect effects of weather via time spent indoors away-from-home on COVID-19 hospitalizations within five Colorado counties between March 4th 2020 and January 31st 2021. We also evaluated the evidence for seasonal effect modification by comparing the results of all-season (using season as a covariate) to season-stratified models. Four weather conditions were associated with both time spent indoors away-from-home and 12-day lagged COVID-19 hospital admissions in one or more season: high minimum temperature (all-season), low maximum temperature (spring), low minimum absolute humidity (winter), and high solar radiation (all-season & winter). In our mediation analyses, we found evidence that changes in 12-day lagged hospital admissions were primarily via the direct effects of weather conditions, rather than via indirect effects by which weather changes time spent indoors away-from-home. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that weather impacted SARS-CoV-2 transmission via changes in mobility patterns during the first year of the pandemic. Rather, weather appears to have impacted SARS-CoV-2 transmission primarily via mechanisms other than human movement. We recommend further analysis of this phenomenon to determine whether these findings generalize to current SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, as well as other seasonal respiratory pathogens.","1556":"Human parasitic infections-including malaria, and many neglected tropical diseases (NTDs)-have long represented a Gordian knot in global public health: ancient, persistent, and exceedingly difficult to control. With the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic substantially interrupting control programmes worldwide, there are now mounting fears that decades of progress in controlling global parasitic infections will be undone. With Covid-19 moreover exposing deep vulnerabilities in the global health system, the current moment presents a watershed opportunity to plan future efforts to reduce the global morbidity and mortality associated with human parasitic infections. In this chapter, we first provide a brief epidemiologic overview of the progress that has been made towards the control of parasitic diseases between 1990 and 2019, contrasting these fragile gains with the anticipated losses as a result of Covid-19. We then argue that the complementary aspirations of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the World Health Organization (WHO)'s 2030 targets for parasitic disease control may be achieved by aligning programme objectives within the One Health paradigm, recognizing the interdependence between humans, animals, and the environment. In so doing, we note that while the WHO remains the preeminent international institution to address some of these transdisciplinary concerns, its underlying challenges with funding, authority, and capacity are likely to reverberate if left unaddressed. To this end, we conclude by reimagining how models of multisectoral global health governance-combining the WHO's normative and technical leadership with greater support in allied policy-making areas-can help sustain future malaria and NTD elimination efforts.","1557":"We analyzed data from two ongoing COVID-19 longitudinal serological surveys in Orange County, CA., between April 2020 and March 2021. A total of 8476 finger stick blood specimens were collected before and after a vaccination campaign. IgG levels were determined using a multiplex antigen microarray containing antigens from SARS-CoV-2, SARS, MERS, Common CoV, and Influenza. Twenty-six percent of specimens from unvaccinated Orange County residents in December 2020 were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive; out of 852 seropositive individuals 77 had symptoms and 9 sought medical care. The antibody response was predominantly against nucleocapsid (NP), full length, and S2 domain of spike. Anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) reactivity was low and not cross-reactive against SARS S1 or SARS RBD. A vaccination campaign at the University of California Irvine Medical Center (UCIMC) started on December, 2020 and 6724 healthcare workers were vaccinated within 3 weeks. Seroprevalence increased from 13% pre-vaccination to 79% post-vaccination in January, 93% in February, and 99% in March. mRNA vaccination induced higher antibody levels than natural exposure, especially against the RBD domain and cross-reactivity against SARS RBD and S1 was observed. Nucleocapsid protein antibodies can be used to distinguish vaccinees to classify pre-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Previously infected individuals developed higher antibody titers to the vaccine than non pre-exposed individuals. Hospitalized patients in intensive care with severe disease reach significantly higher antibody levels than mild cases, but lower antibody levels compared to the vaccine. These results indicate that mRNA vaccination rapidly induces a much stronger and broader antibody response than SARS-CoV-2 infection.","1558":"In December 2019, the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019- nCoV) in wuhan, China, attracting attention worldwidely. The novel coronavirus has the characteristics of rapid transmission, atypical clinical symptoms, and easy to affect both lungs, leading to missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis, as well as difficult to detection and assessment at early stage. Fever, cough, myalgia, weakness, dyspnea and imagings may be helpful for the early detection of novel coronavirus pneumonia. At the same time, the rate of disease progression, fever, CT manifestations, hypoxia degree, age, basic diseases, and laboratory indicators can also be used to evaluate the severity of the novel coronavirus pneumonia.","1559":"As of November 2015, the Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic that began in West Africa in late 2013 is waning. The human toll includes more than 28,000 EVD cases and 11,000 deaths in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, the most heavily-affected countries. We reviewed 66 mathematical modeling studies of the EVD epidemic published in the peer-reviewed literature to assess the key uncertainties models addressed, data used for modeling, public sharing of data and results, and model performance. Based on the review, we suggest steps to improve the use of modeling in future public health emergencies. ","1560":"As immunization campaigns are accelerating, understanding how to distribute the scarce doses of vaccines is of paramount importance and a quantitative analysis of the trade-offs involved in domestic-only versus cooperative distribution is still missing. In this study we use a network Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model to show circumstances under which it is in a country's self-interest to ensure other countries can obtain COVID-19 vaccines rather than focusing only on vaccination of their own residents. In particular, we focus our analysis on the United States and estimate the internal burden of COVID-19 disease under different scenarios about vaccine cooperation. We show that in scenarios in which the US has reached the threshold for domestic herd immunity, the US may find it optimal to donate doses to other countries with lower vaccination coverage, as this would allow for a sharp reduction in the inflow of infected individuals from abroad.","1561":"718 families and 2501 individuals were enrolled, from May 2020 to November 2021. The incidence density of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the first wave was 2, 3 times that of the other waves. The incidence among children was lower than that of older participants, except in later waves, when vaccination of the elderly reached 90%. Household agglomeration was significantly associated with incidence only during the first wave.The incidence of infection greatly exceeded rates reported in similar cohorts. The observed reduction in incidence in the elderly during the Delta variant wave, in spite of the rollback of NPIs, can be attributed to increased vaccine coverage. The high incidence in young people reinforces the importance of vaccination in this age group, a policy that has yet to receive the full support of some sectors of society.Prospective cohort of children and household contacts screened for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR and serology (IgG). The incidence density of PCR positive infections estimated for each wave - the first wave, Zeta, Gamma and Delta - was compared to an index combining NPIs and vaccination coverage.Incidence rates of SARS-CoV-2 infections in low-resource communities can inform vaccination strategies and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Our objective was to estimate incidence over four epidemic waves in a slum in Rio de Janeiro, a proxy for economically deprived areas in the Global South.UK Medical Research Council, Foundation for the Advancement of Science of the State of Rio de Janeiro, National Council for Scientific and Technological Development.","1562":"The availability of massive data-sets describing human mobility offers the possibility to design simulation tools to monitor and improve the resilience of transport systems in response to traumatic events such as natural and man-made disasters (e.g., floods, terrorist attacks, etc. . . ). In this perspective, we propose ACHILLES, an application to models people's movements in a given transport mode through a multiplex network representation based on mobility data. ACHILLES is a web-based application which provides an easy-to-use interface to explore the mobility fluxes and the connectivity of every urban zone in a city, as well as to visualize changes in the transport system resulting from the addition or removal of transport modes, urban zones, and single stops. Notably, our application allows the user to assess the overall resilience of the transport network by identifying its weakest node, i.e. Urban Achilles Heel, with reference to the ancient Greek mythology. To demonstrate the impact of ACHILLES for humanitarian aid we consider its application to a real-world scenario by exploring human mobility in Singapore in response to flood prevention.","1563":"Unmet need for HIV testing and PrEP prescriptions during the COVID-19 pandemic may temporarily increase HIV incidence in the years immediately after the disruption period.We used an agent-based model to simulate HIV transmission among Black\/African American men who have sex with men in Mississippi over 5 years to estimate how different reductions in access affected the number of undiagnosed HIV cases, new pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) starts, and HIV incidence.Disruptions in access to in-person human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) preventive care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have a negative impact on our progress towards the Ending the HIV Epidemic goals in the United States.We found that each additional 25% decrease in HIV testing and PrEP initiation was associated with decrease of 20% in the number of cases diagnosed and 23% in the number of new PrEP starts, leading to a 15% increase in HIV incidence from 2020 to 2022.","1564":"Computational models of normal liver function and xenobiotic induced liver damage are increasingly being used to interpret in vitro and in vivo data and as an approach to the de novo prediction of the liver's response to xenobiotics. The microdosimetry (dose at the level of individual cells) of xenobiotics vary spatially within the liver because of both compound-independent and compound-dependent factors. In this paper, we build model liver lobules to investigate the interplay between vascular structure, blood flow and cellular transport that lead to regional variations in microdosimetry. We then compared simulation results obtained using this complex spatial model with a simpler linear pipe model of a sinusoid and a very simple single box model. We found that variations in diffusive transport, transporter-mediated transport and metabolism, coupled with complex liver sinusoid architecture and blood flow distribution, led to three essential patterns of xenobiotic exposure within the virtual liver lobule: (1) lobular-wise uniform, (2) radially varying and (3) both radially and azimuthally varying. We propose to use these essential patterns of exposure as a reference for selection of model representations when a computational study involves modeling detailed hepatic responses to xenobiotics.","1565":"It is becoming increasingly popular to produce high-resolution maps of vaccination coverage by fitting Bayesian geostatistical models to data from household surveys. Usually, the surveys adopt a stratified cluster sampling design. We discuss a number of crucial choices with respect to two key aspects of the map production process: the acknowledgement of the survey design in modeling, and the appropriate presentation of estimates and their uncertainties. Specifically, we consider the importance of accounting for urban\/rural stratification and cluster-level non-spatial excess variation in survey outcomes, when fitting geostatistical models. We also discuss the trade-off between the geographical scale and precision of model-based estimates, and demonstrate visualization methods for mapping and ranking that emphasize the probabilistic interpretation of results. A novel approach to coverage map presentation is proposed to allow comparison and control of the overall map uncertainty. We use measles vaccination coverage in Nigeria as a motivating example and illustrate the different issues using data from the 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey.","1566":"In this cross-sectional study, 12-to-15-month-old children were recruited in Bangladesh, India, Kenya, and Peru. Children were assessed with a 4-hour 13C-SBT and a 90-minute LR test. Plasma was collected for the determination of citrulline and the kynurenine\/tryptophan ratio. Length and weight were measured, and other variables were assessed through questionnaires. For a subset of children, anthropometry was re-measured after three months. inear regression was used to examine associations corresponding to each objective.In children at risk of EE there were no associations between the 13C-SBT, LR or other EE biomarkers encompassing different pathophysiological domains of EE.The primary objective of this study was to assess the relationship between the 13C-SBT and the lactulose\/rhamnose ratio (LR) and growth in children. Secondary objectives were to assess the relationship between the 13C-SBT and additional biomarkers of EE. We also characterised the relationship between the 13C-SBT and child sex anddietary diversity, and household socioeconomic status and food security.Three sites generated 13C-SBT breath curves that enabled pooled analysis. Differences in 13C-SBT breath curves, LR ratios, and other EE biomarkers were observed between sites. No associations were observed for 13C-SBT summary measures and LR, or child growth (e.g., association between LR and cumulative percent dose recovered at 90 minutes (cPDR90): -0.39, 95%CI: -1.79, 0.70). Length-for-age and weight-for-age were positively associated with the time to 50% of dose recovered (T50) (0.05, 95%CI: 0.01, 0.09, and 0.05, 95%CI: 0.02, 0.07, respectively), and dietary diversity was associated with T50 and cPDR90(-0.10, 95%CI: -0.18, -0.02 and 2.67, 95%CI: 0.47, 4.88, respectively).https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/study\/NCT04109352.Environmental enteropathy' (EE) is common among children who are highly exposed to enteric pathogens in low-resource settings.

Existing tuberculosis control strategies that rely on passive case-finding appear insufficient to achieve targets for reductions in tuberculosis incidence and mortality. Active case-finding strategies aim to detect infectious individuals earlier in their infectious period to reduce onward transmission and improve treatment outcomes. Empirical studies of active case-finding have produced mixed results and determining how to direct active screening to those most at risk remains a topic of intense research. Our systematic review of literature evaluating the effects of geographically targeted tuberculosis screening interventions found three studies in low tuberculosis incidence settings, but none conducted in high tuberculosis incidence countries. We discuss open questions related to the use of spatially targeted approaches for active screening in countries where tuberculosis incidence is highest.","1568":" ; monarch tolerance to infection decreased, and parasite virulence increased. Declines in medicinal quality were associated with declines in foliar concentrations of lipophilic cardenolides. Our results emphasize that global environmental change may influence parasite-host interactions through changes in the medicinal properties of plants.","1569":"The encounter and capture of bacteria and phytoplankton by microbial predators and parasites is fundamental to marine ecosystem organization and activity. Here, we combined classic biophysical models with published laboratory measurements to infer functional traits, including encounter kernel and capture efficiency, for a wide range of marine viruses and microzooplankton grazers. Despite virus particles being orders of magnitude smaller than microzooplankton grazers, virus encounter kernels and adsorption rates were in many cases comparable in magnitude to grazer encounter kernel and clearance, pointing to Brownian motion as a highly effective method of transport for viruses. Inferred virus adsorption efficiency covered many orders of magnitude, but the median virus adsorption efficiency was between 5 and 25% depending on the assumed host swimming speed. Uncertainty on predator detection area and swimming speed prevented robust inference of grazer capture efficiency, but sensitivity analysis was used to identify bounds on unconstrained processes. These results provide a common functional trait framework for understanding marine host-virus and predator-prey interactions, and highlight the value of theory for interpreting measured life-history traits.","1570":"Range maps are used to estimate the geographic extent of taxa, providing valuable information for biodiversity and conservation research and management. Freshwater macroinvertebrates are not well-represented in the range map literature relative to freshwater vertebrates. To address this knowledge gap, we provide range maps for 1158 freshwater macroinvertebrate genera based on two decades of publicly available occurrence data from the USEPA National Aquatic Resource Surveys, which included 11,628 sites and 6,906,990 organisms across the contiguous USA. Maps were created by applying unweighted and weighted pair group method with arithmetic mean clustering and single-linkage clustering algorithms to the occurrence data and creating three layers of polygons from the minimum convex hulls of clusters. A total of 25 freshwater macroinvertebrate classes are represented in the range map dataset. Most mapped genera were insects (394\/1158), followed by malacostracans (242\/1158), polychaetes (182\/1158), and bivalves (121\/1158). Additionally, we provide waterbody type percent occupancy data for all genera, detailing how genera are partitioned between boatable streams, wadeable streams, inland lakes, Laurentian Great Lakes, and coastal estuaries.","1571":"Due to the need to control the type I error rate in trials used to license a vaccine, incorporating historical data provides little additional benefit in terms of stopping the trial early. However, these statistical approaches could be promising in evaluations that use real-world evidence following licensure.Based on the outcomes from a failed trial of a maternal vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), we simulated data for a new Bayesian group-sequential trial. We analyzed the data either ignoring data from the previous trial (i.e., weakly informative prior distributions) or using prior distributions incorporating the historical data into the analysis. We evaluated scenarios where efficacy in the new trial was the same, greater than, or less than that in the original trial. For each scenario, we evaluated the statistical power and type I error rate for estimating the vaccine effect following interim analyses.When we used a stringent threshold to control the type I error rate, analyses incorporating historical data had a small advantage over trials that did not. If control of type I error is less important (e.g., in a post-licensure evaluation), the incorporation of historical data can provide a substantial boost in efficiency.When a randomized controlled trial fails to demonstrate statistically significant efficacy against the primary endpoint, a potentially costly new trial would need to be conducted to receive licensure. Incorporating data from previous trials might allow for more efficient follow-up trials to demonstrate efficacy, speeding availability of effective vaccines.","1572":"Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) often implement overseas development aid through intensive small-scale animal agriculture to alleviate food insecurity in low- and middle-income countries. Intensive animal farming can pose unclear outcomes to households engaged in the practice because of the reliance on industrial animal breeds that are reared with antibiotics and raised in higher densities compared to traditional scavenging husbandry systems. As a result, intensive small-scale farming operations that lack proper infrastructure, training, and financial resources could facilitate the spread of antimicrobial resistance and infectious diseases. We applied a mixed-methods framework towards analyzing the effectiveness of small-scale broiler chicken farming in northern Ecuador. First, from May 2016 - May 2017, our observational surveys indicated that intensive small-scale poultry farming follows a boom-and-bust cycle that is extremely vulnerable to environmental stressors. Second, in May 2016, we followed a cohort of households enrolled in a poultry development project led by an NGO. We observed a substantial decline in chicken survivorship from Survey period 1 to 2 (mean chicken count decrease from 50 to 35 corresponding to a 70% survivorship) and from Survey period 2 to 3 (mean chicken count decrease from 35 to 20.3 corresponding to a 58% survivorship). Heads of households were self-reporting broiler chicken survivorship substantially higher than our recorded observations during survey period two (46 compared to 35 respectively) and three (44.3 compared to 20.3 respectively). We speculate that if households continue to inaccurately report poultry demographics, then it could perpetuate a negative feedback loop where NGOs continue to conduct the same intervention practices without receiving accurate outcome metrics. Third, we used semi-structured questionnaires to determine that access to financial resources was the major motivation for determining when to farm broiler chickens. Intensive small-scale poultry farming can be unreliable and disease-enhancing, yet also associated with dubious self-reports of success.","1573":"The B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant surge has raised concerns about the effectiveness of vaccines and the impact of imprudent reopening. Leveraging over two years of county-level COVID-19 data in the US, this study aims to investigate relationships among vaccination, human mobility, and COVID-19 health outcomes (assessed via case rate and case-fatality rate), controlling for socioeconomic, demographic, racial\/ethnic, and partisan factors. A set of cross-sectional models was first fitted to empirically compare disparities in COVID-19 health outcomes before and during the Omicron surge. Then, time-varying mediation analyses were employed to delineate how the effects of vaccine and mobility on COVID-19 health outcomes vary over time. Results showed that vaccine effectiveness against case rate lost significance during the Omicron surge, while its effectiveness against case-fatality rate remained significant throughout the pandemic. We also documented salient structural inequalities in COVID-19-related outcomes, with disadvantaged populations consistently bearing a larger brunt of case and death tolls, regardless of high vaccination rates. Last, findings revealed that mobility presented a significantly positive relationship with case rates during each wave of variant outbreak. Mobility substantially mediated the direct effect from vaccination to case rate, leading to a 10.276\u202f% (95\u202f% CI: 6.257, 14.294) decrease in vaccine effectiveness on average. Altogether, our study implies that sole reliance on vaccination to halt COVID-19 needs to be re-examined. Well-resourced and coordinated efforts to enhance vaccine effectiveness, mitigate health disparity and selectively loosen non-pharmaceutical interventions are essential to bringing the pandemic to an end.","1574":"The methods to ascertain cases of an emerging infectious disease are typically biased toward cases with more severe disease, which can bias the average infection-severity profile. Here, we conducted a systematic review to extract information on disease severity among index cases and secondary cases identified by contact tracing of index cases for COVID-19. We identified 38 studies to extract information on measures of clinical severity. The proportion of index cases with fever was 43% higher than for secondary cases. The proportion of symptomatic, hospitalized, and fatal illnesses among index cases were 12%, 126%, and 179% higher than for secondary cases, respectively. We developed a statistical model to utilize the severity difference, and estimate 55% of index cases were missed in Wuhan, China. Information on disease severity in secondary cases should be less susceptible to ascertainment bias and could inform estimates of disease severity and the proportion of missed index cases.","1575":"Objectives This study evaluated multiple computed tomography (CT) workforce models to identify any implications on efficiency (length of stay, scan frequency and workforce cost) and scanning radiographer interruptions through substituting or supplementing with a trained CT assistant. Methods The study was conducted in a CT unit of a tertiary Queensland hospital and prospectively compared four workforce models, including usual practice: Model 1 used an administrative assistant (AA) and one radiographer; Model 2 substituted a medical imaging assistant (MIA) for the AA; Model 3 was usual practice, consisting of two radiographers; and Model 4 included two radiographers, with a supplemented MIA. Observational data were collected over 7 days per model and were cross-checked against electronic records. Data for interruption type and frequency, as well as scan type and duration, were collected. Annual workforce costs were calculated as measures of efficiency. Results Similar scan frequency and parameters (complexity) occurred across all models, averaging 164 scans (interquartile range 160-172 scans) each. The median times from patient arrival to examination completion in Models 1-4 were 47, 35, 46 and 33min respectively. There were between 34 and 104 interruptions per day across all models, with the 'assistant role' fielding the largest proportion. Model 4 demonstrated the highest workforce cost, and Model 2 the lowest. Conclusion This study demonstrated that assistant models offer similar patient throughput to usual practice at a reduced cost. Model 2 was the most efficient of all two-staff models (Models 1-3), offering the cheapest workforce, slightly higher throughput and faster examination times. Not surprisingly, the additional staff model (Model 4) offered greater overall examination times and throughput, with fewer interruptions, although workforce cost and possible role ambiguity were both limitations of this model. These findings may assist decision makers in selecting the optimal workforce design for their own individual contexts. What is known about the topic? Innovative solutions are required to address ongoing health workforce sustainability concerns. Workforce substitution models using trained assistants have demonstrated numerous benefits internationally, with translation to the Australian allied health setting showing promise. What does this paper add? Building on existing research, this study provides clinical workforce alternatives that maintain patient throughput while offering cost efficiencies. This study also quantified the many daily interruptions that occur within the CT setting, highlighting a potential clinical risk. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to empirically test the use of allied health assistants within CT. What are the implications for practitioners? Role substitution in CT may offer solutions to skills shortages, increasing expenditure and service demand. Incorporating appropriate assistant workforce models can maintain throughput while demonstrating implications for efficiency and interruptions, potentially affecting staff stress and burnout. In addition, the assistant's scope and accepted level of interruptions should be considerations when choosing the most appropriate model.","1576":"The Antibody Mediated Prevention (AMP) trials (NCT02716675 and NCT02568215) demonstrated that passive administration of the broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody VRC01 could prevent some HIV-1 acquisition events. Here, we use mathematical modeling in a post hoc analysis to demonstrate that VRC01 influenced viral loads in AMP participants who acquired HIV. Instantaneous inhibitory potential (IIP), which integrates VRC01 serum concentration and VRC01 sensitivity of acquired viruses in terms of both IC50 and IC80, follows a dose-response relationship with first positive viral load (p\u2009=\u20090.03), which is particularly strong above a threshold of IIP\u2009=\u20091.6 (r\u2009=\u2009-0.6, p\u2009=\u20092e-4). Mathematical modeling reveals that VRC01 activity predicted from in vitro IC80s and serum VRC01 concentrations overestimates in vivo neutralization by 600-fold (95% CI: 300-1200). The trained model projects that even if future therapeutic HIV trials of combination monoclonal antibodies do not always prevent acquisition, reductions in viremia and reservoir size could be expected.","1577":"Propagule pressure is often considered the most consistent predictor of the success of founding populations. This relationship could be mediated by the composition of the founding group (e.g. level of prior adaptation to the recipient environment or its diversity) as well as the introduction scenario (i.e. the frequency, size and timing of discrete introduction events). We introduced groups of Tribolium castaneum (red flour beetle) eggs across three levels of propagule pressure (n = 15, 30, 60), of three possible compositions (single, adapted lineage; single, unadapted lineage; mixed lineages) to a novel environment using six unique introduction scenarios, in a fully factorial design to evaluate the importance of composition and introduction scenario in influencing the relationship between propagule pressure and establishment. In our system, prior adaptation to the environment, including having some adapted individuals in mixed groups, rivaled the importance of propagule pressure in determining the establishment success and size of founding populations. More frequent introduction events resulted in fewer individuals that initially survived founding, but introduction scenario did not significantly influence establishment success or population size. This experimental evidence demonstrates the importance of context, both of the founding group and the recipient environment, in understanding how propagule pressure influences the success of founding populations.","1578":"Engaging in survival sex and mental illness are overrepresented within homeless populations. This article assesses the relationship between symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and engaging in survival sex among homeless women. One hundred and fifty-eight homeless women completed surveys on self-reported BPD symptomology and sexual history. Bivariate and multivariate analyses conducted in this study provided insights into the association of experiencing BPD symptoms and engaging in survival sex. Results indicate that some symptoms of BPD are robustly correlated with engaging in survival sex among homeless adult women. Implications for service agencies and others working with at-risk female populations are discussed.","1579":"As a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to spread widely and claim lives worldwide, its transmission characteristics remain uncertain. Here, we present and analyze the serial intervals-the time period between the onset of symptoms in an index (infector) case and the onset of symptoms in a secondary (infectee) case-of 339 confirmed cases of COVID-19 identified from 264 cities in mainland China prior to February 19, 2020. Here, we provide the complete dataset in both English and Chinese to support further COVID-19 research and modeling efforts.","1580":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate data on oseltamivir dispensing extracted from medical claims records as an indicator of influenza activity in the United States for the 2010-11 through 2014-15 influenza seasons.Over 34 million residents of the United States aged 65\u00a0years and older are also Medicare prescription drug beneficiaries. Medical claims records for this age group potentially provide a wealth of data for better understanding influenza epidemiology.We used Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) medical claims data to evaluate the weekly number of therapeutic oseltamivir prescriptions dispensed following a rapid influenza diagnostic test among beneficiaries 65\u00a0years old and older as an indicator of influenza timing and intensity. We compared the temporal changes in this indicator to changes in the proportion of influenza-like illnesses among outpatient visits in the US Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) by administrative regions defined by the US Department of Health and Human Services. Using the moving epidemic method, we determined intensity thresholds and categorized the severity of seasons for both CMS and ILINet data.Our results support the use of oseltamivir dispensing in medical claims data as an indicator of US influenza activity.Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services oseltamivir data and ILINet data were strongly correlated by administrative region (median Spearman's \u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.78; interquartile range\u00a0=\u00a00.73-0.80). CMS oseltamivir data and ILINet data substantially agreed (Cohen's weighted \u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.62) as to the seasonal severity across administrative regions.","1581":"Predicting ecological effects of contaminants remains challenging because of the sheer number of chemicals and their ambiguous role in biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships. We evaluate responses of experimental pond ecosystems to standardized concentrations of 12 pesticides, nested in four pesticide classes and two pesticide types. We show consistent effects of herbicides and insecticides on ecosystem function, and slightly less consistent effects on community composition. Effects of pesticides on ecosystem function are mediated by alterations in the abundance and community composition of functional groups. Through bottom-up effects, herbicides reduce respiration and primary productivity by decreasing the abundance of phytoplankton. The effects of insecticides on respiration and primary productivity of phytoplankton are driven by top-down effects on zooplankton composition and abundance, but not richness. By demonstrating consistent effects of pesticides on communities and ecosystem functions and linking pesticide-induced changes in functional groups of organisms to ecosystem functions, the study suggests that ecological risk assessment of registered chemicals could be simplified to synthetic chemical classes or types and groups of organisms with similar functions and chemical toxicities.","1582":"The Syrian conflict has damaged key infrastructure and indirectly affected almost all parts of the Middle East and Europe, with no end in sight. Exhausting conditions created by the Syrian crisis and related massive displacement promote the emergence of numerous public health problems that fuel antimicrobial resistance (AMR) development. Here, we explore the current situation of the Syrian displaced population, and AMR inside Syria and among refugees in host countries. We then suggest a roadmap of selected key interventions and strategies to address the threat of AMR in the context of the Syrian crisis. These recommendations are intended to urge health policy-makers in governments and international health organizations to optimize and push for implementing an effective policy taking into consideration the current obstacles.","1583":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was one of the significant causes of death worldwide in 2020. The disease is caused by severe acute coronavirus syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), an RNA virus of the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae related to 2 other clinically relevant coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Like other coronaviruses and several other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats. However, unlike other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 resulted in a devastating pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic rages on due to viral evolution that leads to more transmissible and immune evasive variants. Technology such as genomic sequencing has driven the shift from syndromic to molecular epidemiology and promises better understanding of variants. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed critical impediments that must be addressed to develop the science of pandemics. Much of the progress is being applied in the developed world. However, barriers to the use of molecular epidemiology in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remain, including lack of logistics for equipment and reagents and lack of training in analysis. We review the molecular epidemiology literature to understand its origins from the SARS epidemic (2002-2003) through influenza events and the current COVID-19 pandemic. We advocate for improved genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV and understanding the pathogen diversity in potential zoonotic hosts. This work will require training in phylogenetic and high-performance computing to improve analyses of the origin and spread of pathogens. The overarching goals are to understand and abate zoonosis risk through interdisciplinary collaboration and lowering logistical barriers.","1584":"By numerical calculation, we show that the control reproduction number is monotone decreasing and convex downward with respect to the testing rate, which implies that the improvement of the testing rate would highly contribute to reduce the epidemic size if the original testing rate is small. Moreover, we show that the recurrence of the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan could be possible after the lifting of the state of emergency if there is no massive testing and quarantine.In this paper, we construct a mathematical model and discuss the effect of massive testing with quarantine, which would be less likely to affect the social and economic systems, and its efficacy has been proved in South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and Hong Kong.If we have entered into an explosive phase of the epidemic, the massive testing could be a strong tool to prevent the disease as long as the positively reacted individuals will be effectively quarantined, no matter whether the positive reaction is pseudo or not. Since total population could be seen as a superposition of smaller communities, we could understand how testing and quarantine policy might be powerful to control the disease.The pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread and caused enormous and serious damages to many countries worldwide. One of the most typical interventions is the social distancing such as lockdown that would contribute to reduce the number of contacts among undiagnosed individuals. However, prolongation of the period of such a restrictive intervention could hugely affect the social and economic systems, and the outbreak will come back if the strong social distancing policy will end earlier due to the economic damage. Therefore, the social distancing policy should be followed by massive testing accompanied with quarantine to eradicate the infection.","1585":"European healthcare systems face extreme pressure from coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We relate country-specific accumulated COVID-19 deaths (intensity approach) and active COVID-19 cases (magnitude approach) to measures of healthcare system capacity: hospital beds, healthcare workers and healthcare expenditure. Modelled by the intensity approach with a composite measure for healthcare capacity, the countries experiencing the highest pressure on 25 March 2020 - relative to Italy on 11 March - were Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and France (www.covid-hcpressure.org).","1586":"Phylogenomics has enriched our understanding that the Tree of Life can have network-like or reticulate structures among some taxa and genes. Two non-vertical modes of evolution - hybridization\/introgression and horizontal gene transfer - deviate from a strictly bifurcating tree model, causing non-treelike patterns. However, these reticulate processes can produce similar patterns to incomplete lineage sorting or recombination, potentially leading to ambiguity. Here, we present a brief overview of a phylogenomic workflow for inferring organismal histories and compare methods for distinguishing modes of reticulate evolution. We discuss how the timing of coalescent events can help disentangle introgression from incomplete lineage sorting and how horizontal gene transfer events can help determine the relative timing of speciation events. In doing so, we identify pitfalls of certain methods and discuss how to extend their utility across the Tree of Life. Workflows, methods, and future directions discussed herein underscore the need to embrace reticulate evolutionary patterns for understanding the timing and rates of evolutionary events, providing a clearer view of life's history.","1587":"We study the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations in the context of stochastic finite element discretizations. Specifically, we assume that the viscosity is a random field given in the form of a generalized polynomial chaos expansion. For the resulting stochastic problem, we formulate the model and linearization schemes using Picard and Newton iterations in the framework of the stochastic Galerkin method, and we explore properties of the resulting stochastic solutions. We also propose a preconditioner for solving the linear systems of equations arising at each step of the stochastic (Galerkin) nonlinear iteration and demonstrate its effectiveness for solving a set of benchmark problems.","1588":"Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective and safe intervention approved for use to prevent HIV transmission. PrEP scale-up strategies and clinical practice are currently being informed by modeling studies, which have estimated the impact of PrEP in adult and adolescent MSM populations separately. This partitioning may miss important effects or yield biased estimates by excluding dependencies between populations.PrEP use among eligible 19-39 year old MSM averted 29.0% of infections and reduced HIV prevalence from 23.2% to 17.0% over ten years in the population as a whole. Despite being ineligible for PrEP in this scenario, prevalence among sexually active 18 year-olds declined from 6.0% to 4.3% due to reduced transmissions across age cohorts. The addition of PrEP for adolescents ages 16-18 had a small impact on the overall epidemic, further reducing overall prevalence from 17.0% to 16.8%; however prevalence among the sexually active 18 year-olds further declined from 4.3% to 3.8%.We combined two published models of HIV transmission among adults and adolescent MSM. We simulated an HIV epidemic among MSM aged 13-39 without PrEP, with PrEP for adult MSM ages (19-39) and with the addition of PrEP for adolescents ages (16-18), comparing percent of incident infections averted (impact), the number of person-years on PrEP per infection averted (efficiency), and changes in prevalence.PrEP use among adults may significantly reduce HIV prevalence among MSM and may also have significant downstream effects on HIV incidence among adolescents; PrEP targeting adolescents remains an important intervention for HIV prevention.","1589":"Recent evidence suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.351 exhibits partial immune evasion to antibodies generated by natural infection or vaccination. We used a dynamic transmission model to evaluate whether this variant could become dominant in the United States given mounting vaccination coverage and other circulating variants. We show that B.1.351 is unlikely to become dominant even when all fully vaccinated individuals return to their pre-pandemic behavior. However, an improved selection advantage of B.1.351 arising from a combination of increased transmission and immune escape could drive this variant to dominance as early as July 2021 and fuel a resurgence of cases and hospitalizations. Our study underscores the urgency for continued rollout of the current generation of vaccines despite the emergence of immune escape variants.","1590":"Simulation models are increasingly used to inform epidemiological studies and health policy, yet there is great variation in their transparency and reproducibility. This review provides an overview of applications of simulation models in health policy and epidemiology, analyzes the use of best reporting practices, and assesses the reproducibility of the models using predefined, categorical criteria. 1,613 studies were identified and analyzed. We found an exponential growth in the number of studies over the past half century, with the highest growth in dynamic modeling approaches. The largest subset of studies is focused on disease policy models (70%), within which pathological conditions, viral diseases, neoplasms, and cardiovascular diseases account for one-third of the articles. Nearly half of the studies do not report the details of their models. We also provide in depth analysis of modeling best practices, reporting quality and reproducibility for a subset of 100 articles (50 highly cited and 50 random). Only seven of 26 in-depth evaluation criteria were satisfied by more than 80% of samples. We identify areas for increased application of simulation modeling and opportunities to enhance the rigor and documentation in the conduct and reporting of simulation modeling in epidemiology and health policy.","1591":"The inverse probability weighted Cox model is frequently used to estimate the marginal hazard ratio. Its validity requires a crucial condition that the propensity score model be correctly specified. To provide protection against misspecification of the propensity score model, we propose a weighted estimation method rooted in the empirical likelihood theory. The proposed estimator is multiply robust in that it is guaranteed to be consistent when a set of postulated propensity score models contains a correctly specified model. Our simulation studies demonstrate satisfactory finite sample performance of the proposed method in terms of consistency and efficiency. We apply the proposed method to compare the risk of postoperative hospitalization between sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass using data from a large medical claims and billing database. We further extend the development to multisite studies to enable each site to postulate multiple site-specific propensity score models.","1592":"In this paper we study intra-host viral adaptation by antigenic cooperation - a mechanism of immune escape that serves as an alternative to the standard mechanism of escape by continuous genomic diversification and allows to explain a number of experimental observations associated with the establishment of chronic infections by highly mutable viruses. Within this mechanism, the topology of a cross-immunoreactivity network forces intra-host viral variants to specialize for complementary roles and adapt to host's immune response as a quasi-social ecosystem. Here we study dynamical changes in immune adaptation caused by evolutionary and epidemiological events. First, we show that the emergence of a viral variant with altered antigenic features may result in a rapid re-arrangement of the viral ecosystem and a change in the roles played by existing viral variants. In particular, it may push the population under immune escape by genomic diversification towards the stable state of adaptation by antigenic cooperation. Next, we study the effect of a viral transmission between two chronically infected hosts, which results in merging of two intra-host viral populations in the state of stable immune-adapted equilibrium. In this case, we also describe how the newly formed viral population adapts to the host's environment by changing the functions of its members. The results are obtained analytically for minimal cross-immunoreactivity networks and numerically for larger populations.","1593":"We evaluated routine infant vaccination with and without catch-up campaigns among older individuals. We used a dynamic model of typhoid transmission to simulate cases, hospitalizations, deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) lost, treatment and intervention costs. We estimated cost-effectiveness (in terms of cost in international dollars (I$) per DALY averted) from the healthcare payer perspective, and assessed how it was influenced by uncertain model parameters. Compared to no vaccination, routine infant vaccination at I$1\/dose was cost-saving in Delhi and Dong Thap, \"very cost-effective\" in Kolkata and Nairobi, and \"cost-effective\" in Lwak according to World Health Organization thresholds. However, routine vaccination was not the optimal strategy compared to strategies that included a catch-up campaign, which yielded the highest probability of being cost-saving in Delhi and Dong Thap and were most likely to provide a return on investment above a willingness-to-pay threshold of I$1440 in Kolkata, I$2300 in Nairobi, and I$5360 in Lwak. Vaccine price impacted the optimal strategy, and the number of doses required and rate of hospitalization were the primary sources of uncertainty.Typhoid fever remains endemic in low- and middle-income countries. Programmatic use of existing vaccines is limited, but upcoming typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) could warrant wider use. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of five TCV delivery strategies in three urban areas (Delhi and Kolkata, India and Nairobi, Kenya) and two rural settings (Lwak, Kenya and Dong Thap, Vietnam) with varying incidence.Routine vaccination with TCV would be cost-effective in most settings, and additional one-time catch-up campaigns would also be economically justified.","1594":"Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) are being used worldwide. A key question is whether the impact of PCVs on pneumonia is similar in low- and high-income populations. However, most low-income countries, where the burden of disease is greatest, lack reliable data that can be used to evaluate the impact. Data from middle-income countries that have both low- and high-income subpopulations can provide a proxy measure for the impact of the vaccine in low-income countries.We evaluated the impact of PCV10 on hospitalizations for all-cause pneumonia in Brazil, a middle-income country with localities that span a broad range of human development index (HDI) levels. We used complementary time series and spatiotemporal methods (synthetic controls and hierarchical Bayesian spatial regression) to test whether the decline in pneumonia hospitalizations associated with vaccine introduction varied across the socioeconomic spectrum.We found that the declines in all-cause pneumonia hospitalizations in children and young and middle-aged adults did not vary substantially across low and high HDI subpopulations. Moreover, the estimated declines seen in infants and young adults were associated with higher levels of uptake of the vaccine at a local level.These results suggest that PCVs have an important impact on hospitalizations for all-cause pneumonia in both low- and high-income populations.","1595":"We conclude that there is no significant evidence to suggest that schools are playing a substantial role in driving spread in the community and that careful monitoring may be required as schools re-open to determine the effect associated with open schools upon community incidence.Here, we analyse data on school absences in late 2020 as a result of COVID-19 infection and how that varied through time as other measures in the community were introduced. We utilise data from the Department for Education Educational Settings database and examine how pupil and teacher absences change in both primary and secondary schools.Our results show that absences as a result of COVID-19 infection rose steadily following the re-opening of schools in September. Cases in teachers declined during the November lockdown, particularly in regions previously in tier 3, the highest level of control at the time. Cases in secondary school pupils increased for the first 2 weeks of the November lockdown, before decreasing. Since the introduction of the tier system, the number of absences with confirmed infection in primary schools was observed to be (markedly) lower than that in secondary schools. In December, we observed a large rise in the number of absences per school in secondary school settings in the South East and London, but such rises were not observed in other regions or in primary school settings. We conjecture that the increased transmissibility of the new variant in these regions may have contributed to this rise in secondary school cases. Finally, we observe a positive correlation between cases in the community and cases in schools in most regions, with weak evidence suggesting that cases in schools lag behind cases in the surrounding community.The introduction of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 infection, in the UK in early 2020, resulted in the introduction of several control policies to reduce disease spread. As part of these restrictions, schools were closed to all pupils in March (except for vulnerable and key worker children), before re-opening to certain year groups in June. Finally, all school children returned to the classroom in September.","1596":"Spatial phenomena are subject to scale effects, but there are rarely studies addressing such effects on spatially embedded contact networks. There are two types of structure in these networks, network structure and spatial structure. The network structure has been actively studied. The spatial structure of these networks has received attention only in recent years. Certainly little is known whether the two structures respond to each other. This study examines the scale effects, in terms of spatial extent, on the network structure and the spatial structure of spatially embedded contact networks. Two issues are explored, how the two types of structures change in response to scale changes, and the range of the scale effects. Two sets of areal units, regular grids with 24 different levels of spatial extent and census units of three levels of spatial extent, are used to divide one observed and two reference random networks into multiple scales. Six metrics are used to represent the two structures. Results show different scale effects. In terms of the network structure, the properties of the observed network are sensitive to scale changes at fine scales. In comparison, the clustered spatial structure of the network is scale independent. The behaviors of the network structure are affected by the spatial structure. This information helps identify vulnerable households and communities to health risks and helps deploy intervention strategies to spatially targeted areas.","1597":"Cross-sectional survey.Participants were directed to a web-based survey measuring stress, sleep health, and socio-demographics. Multivariate log-binomial regression models were used to estimate the adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to examine how stress may affect different dimensions of sleep health: 1) poor sleep quality, 2) short sleep duration, 3) problems falling asleep, and 4) problems staying awake in the daytime.Paris, France.Elevated perceived stress can negatively influence sleep health among SMM in Paris, France.Most participants (69.9%) reported at least sometimes feeling stressed (compared to never or rarely). Additionally, results demonstrate that higher perceived stress was associated with poorer sleep health; compared with those who reported feeling stress never or rarely, those who felt stress sometimes, often, or always were more likely to experience poor sleep quality (aRR\u202f=\u202f6.67; 95% CI\u202f=\u202f3.61-12.3), short sleep duration (aRR\u202f=\u202f1.67; 95% CI\u202f=\u202f1.17-2.38), problems falling asleep (aRR\u202f=\u202f3.20; 95% CI\u202f=\u202f2.26-4.52), and problems staying awake during the daytime (aRR\u202f=\u202f3.52; 95% CI\u202f=\u202f1.64-7.53).Gay, bisexual and other SMM users \u226518\u202fyears on a geosocial networking application in Paris, France (N\u202f=\u202f580).The objective of this study was to examine the association between perceived stress and sleep health among a sample of sexual minority men (SMM).","1598":"The correlation between cholera epidemics and climatic drivers, in particular seasonal tropical rainfall, has been studied in a variety of contexts owing to its documented relevance. Several mechanistic models of cholera transmission have included rainfall as a driver by focusing on two possible transmission pathways: either by increasing exposure to contaminated water (e.g. due to worsening sanitary conditions during water excess), or water contamination by freshly excreted bacteria (e.g. due to washout of open-air defecation sites or overflows). Our study assesses the explanatory power of these different modeling structures by formal model comparison using deterministic and stochastic models of the type susceptible-infected-recovered-bacteria (SIRB). The incorporation of rainfall effects is generalized using a nonlinear function that can increase or decrease the relative importance of the large precipitation events. Our modelling framework is tested against the daily epidemiological data collected during the 2015 cholera outbreak within the urban context of Juba, South Sudan. This epidemic is characterized by a particular intra-seasonal double peak on the incidence in apparent relation with particularly strong rainfall events. Our results show that rainfall-based models in both their deterministic and stochastic formulations outperform models that do not account for rainfall. In fact, classical SIRB models are not able to reproduce the second epidemiological peak, thus suggesting that it was rainfall-driven. Moreover we found stronger support across model types for rainfall acting on increased exposure rather than on exacerbated water contamination. Although these results are context-specific, they stress the importance of a systematic and comprehensive appraisal of transmission pathways and their environmental forcings when embarking in the modelling of epidemic cholera.","1599":"Titers were measured in randomized, placebo-controlled vaccine trials in Hong Kong among pediatrics during September 2009-December 2010 and the United States among adults during Oct 2007-April 2008. Intermediate unobserved titers were imputed using three interpolation methods. As participants were recruited at different times leading to varying exposure to infection relative to entry, a modified proportional hazards model was developed to account for staggered entry into the studies and to quantify the correlation of titers with protection against influenza infections, adjusting for waning in titers. The model was fitted using Markov chain Monte Carlo and importance sampling.Correlations between hemagglutination-inhibition titers (hereafter \"titers\") and protection against infection have been identified in historical studies. However, limited information is available about the dynamics of how titer influences protection.A titer of 1:40 was associated with a reduced infection risk of 40%-70% relative to a titer of 1:10, depending on the circulating strain; the corresponding protection associated with a titer of 1:80 was 54%-84%. Results were robust across interpolation methods. The trivalent-inactivated vaccine reduced cumulative incidence of influenza B and influenza A(H3N2) infections by six percentage points (pp; 95% credible interval = 2 pp, 10 pp) and 1 pp (95% credible interval = 0.3 pp, 2 pp) respectively, but not for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. The live-attenuated vaccine showed little efficacy against influenza A(H3N2) infections.Titers are correlated with protection against influenza infections. The trivalent inactivated vaccine can reduce the risk of influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B infections in the community.","1600":"The C-terminal domains of proteases play crucial roles in hydrolysis, substrate adsorption and targeted binding. Identifying and characterizing interactions between C-terminal domains and biomacromolecules can help to examine the diversity as well as the substrate-binding ability of C-terminal domains and to explore novel functions. The bacterial pre-peptidase C-terminal (PPC) domain is a typical C-terminal domain normally found at the C-terminus of bacterial secreted proteases. In this work, we successfully demonstrated that 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (ANS) could be used to rapidly determine the interactions between this C-terminal domain and biomacromolecules. The time-resolved ANS fluorescence of PPC and collagen interaction could be used for quantitative analysis of the collagen-binding capability based on the slope of the time-scanning curve. Using this method, we found that PPC domains had an obvious affinity to fibrillar proteins but had little or no capacity to bind polysaccharides or linear DNAs. Docking studies proved that collagen bound to the same hydrophobic site of PPC as the ANS probe, causing a decrease in the emission intensity. This method is simple and cost effective and provides an effective detection technique to analyze the interaction between this C-terminal domain and biomolecules.","1601":"Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces the risk of drug-sensitive HIV transmission but may increase the transmission of drug-resistant HIV. We used a mathematical model to estimate the long-term population-level benefits of ART and determine the scenarios under which earlier ART (treatment at 1 year post-infection, on average) could decrease simultaneously both total and drug-resistant HIV incidence (new infections). We constructed an infection-age-structured mathematical model that tracked the transmission rates over the course of infection and modelled the patients' life expectancy as a function of ART initiation timing. We fitted this model to the annual AIDS incidence and death data directly, and to resistance data and demographic data indirectly among men who have sex with men (MSM) in San Francisco. Using counterfactual scenarios, we assessed the impact on total and drug-resistant HIV incidence of ART initiation timing, frequency of acquired drug resistance, and second-line drug effectiveness (defined as the combination of resistance monitoring, biomedical drug efficacy and adherence). Earlier ART initiation could decrease the number of both total and drug-resistant HIV incidence when second-line drug effectiveness is sufficiently high (greater than 80%), but increase the proportion of new infections that are drug resistant. Thus, resistance may paradoxically appear to be increasing while actually decreasing.","1602":"This paper presents a workflow system that makes progress on scaling machine learning ensembles, specifically in this first release, ensembles of deep neural networks that address problems in cancer research across the atomistic, molecular and population scales. The initial release of the application framework that we call CANDLE\/Supervisor addresses the problem of hyper-parameter exploration of deep neural networks.Initial results demonstrating CANDLE on DOE systems at ORNL, ANL and NERSC (Titan, Theta and Cori, respectively) demonstrate both scaling and multi-platform execution.Current multi-petaflop supercomputers are powerful systems, but present challenges when faced with problems requiring large machine learning workflows. Complex algorithms running at system scale, often with different patterns that require disparate software packages and complex data flows cause difficulties in assembling and managing large experiments on these machines.","1603":"To explore grazing effects on carbon fluxes in alpine meadow ecosystems, we used a paired eddy-covariance (EC) system to measure carbon fluxes in adjacent fenced (FM) and grazed (GM) meadows on the Tibetan plateau. Gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Re) were greater at GM than FM for the first two years of fencing. In the third year, the productivity at FM increased to a level similar to the GM site. The higher productivity at GM was mainly caused by its higher photosynthetic capacity. Grazing exclusion did not increase carbon sequestration capacity for this alpine grassland system. The higher optimal photosynthetic temperature and the weakened ecosystem response to climatic factors at GM may help to facilitate the adaption of alpine meadow ecosystems to changing climate. ","1604":"Background: Hepatitis C infection could be eliminated. Underdiagnosis and lack of treatment are the barriers to cure, especially for vulnerable populations (i.e. unable to pay for health care).\r\n\r\nMethods: A multilevel intervention from September 2014 to September 2019 focused on the providers and organizations in 'the safety net' (providing health care to populations unable to pay), including: (i) public education, (ii) training for primary care providers (PCPs) and case managers, (iii) case management for high-risk populations, (iv) policy advice and (v) a registry (Registry) for 13 health centers contributing data. The project tracked the number of PCPs trained and, among Registry sites, the number of people screened, engaged in care (i.e. clinical follow-up after diagnosis), treated and\/or cured.\r\n\r\nResults: In Chicago, 215 prescribing PCPs and 56 other health professionals, 86% of whom work in the safety net, were trained to manage hepatitis C. Among Registry sites, there was a 137% increase in antibody screening and a 32% increase in current hepatitis C diagnoses. Engagement in care rose by 18%.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Hepatitis C Community Alliance to Test and Treat (HepCCATT) successfully targeted safety net providers and organizations with a comprehensive care approach. While there were challenges, HepCCATT observed increased hepatitis C screening, diagnosis and engagement in care in the Chicago community.","1605":"Having a cat\/dog in the house can affect the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2.There is evidence that humans can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to cats and dogs. However, there is no evidence that they can transmit it back to humans or play any role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here, we present an exploratory analysis on that matter.We conducted a case-control study with participants with flu-like symptoms seeking care at a primary healthcare unit to be tested for COVID-19. They were asked if they owned pet cats and\/or dogs in their residences, and this variable was evaluated as exposure.The odds ratio of \"having dogs and\/or cats in the residence\" was 1.29 (95% CI 1.08-1.54) of \"having only dogs and no cats\" was 1.26 (1.05-1.52), and \"no dogs and only cats\" was 1.29 (0.95-1.75).","1606":"An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via a link at the top of the paper.","1607":"Although climate change poses a well-established risk to human health, present-day health impacts, particularly those resulting from climate-induced behavioral changes, are under-quantified. Analyzing the U.S. West Coast wildfires of September 2020, we found that poor air quality drives people indoors, increasing the circulation of airborne pathogens like COVID-19. Indoor masking rates as low as 10% can mitigate this risk, offering a clear path to enhance public health responses during wildfires.","1608":"We employed retrospective and prospective space-time scan statistics to assess the situations of COVID-19, influenza, and RSV in 51 US states from October 2021 to February 2022, and from October 2022 to February 2023, respectively. This enabled monitoring of spatiotemporal variations for each epidemic individually and collectively.The US confronted a \"triple-demic\" of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and COVID-19 in the winter of 2022, leading to increased respiratory infections and a higher demand for medical supplies. It is urgent to analyze these epidemics and their spatial-temporal co-occurrence, identifying hotspots and informing public health strategies.Our study offers a novel spatiotemporal approach that combines both univariate and multivariate surveillance, as well as retrospective and prospective analyses. This approach offers a more comprehensive and timely understanding of how the co-occurrence of COVID-19, influenza, and RSV impacts various regions within the United States. Our findings assist in tailor-made strategies to mitigate the effects of these respiratory infections.Compared to winter 2021, COVID-19 cases decreased while influenza and RSV infections significantly increased in winter 2022. We found a high-risk cluster of influenza and COVID-19 (not all three) in winter 2021. In late November 2022, a large high-risk cluster of triple-demic emerged in the central US. The number of states at high risk for multiple epidemics increased from 15 in October 2022 to 21 in January 2023.","1609":"Being overweight\/obese in early adulthood and having 2+ CVRF in early adulthood\/midlife are modifiable targets to redress racial\/ethnic disparities in cognitive impairment and dementia.Linear regression models examined hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and overweight\/obesity at ages 30 to 59 with late-life executive function, semantic memory, verbal episodic memory, and global cognition in a cohort of Asians, blacks, Latinos, and whites (n=1127; mean age=75.8, range=65 to 98). Models adjusted for age at CVRF, age at cognitive assessment, sex, race\/ethnicity, participant education, and parental education.Overall, 34% had 1 CVRF at ages 30 to 59; 19% had 2+. Blacks (26%) and Latinos (23%) were more likely to have 2+ CVRF than Asians (14%) or whites (13%). Having 2+ CVRF was associated with lower global cognition [\u03b2=-0.33; 95% confidence interval (CI)=-0.45, -0.21], executive function (\u03b2=-0.26; 95% CI=-0.39, -0.13), verbal episodic memory (\u03b2=-0.34; 95% CI=-0.48, -0.20), and semantic memory (\u03b2=-0.20; 95% CI=-0.33, -0.07). Interaction by age (P=0.06) indicated overweight\/obesity was negatively associated with executive function at ages 30 to 39 but not at ages 40 to 59. Race\/ethnic-specific effects showed disparities in CVRF prevalence impact population disparities in late-life cognition.Midlife cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) increase dementia risk. Less is known about whether CVRF identified before midlife impact late-life cognition in diverse populations.","1610":"To determine the distribution and causes of extinction threat across functional groups of terrestrial vertebrates, we assembled an ecological trait data set for 18,016 species of terrestrial vertebrates and utilized phylogenetic comparative methods to test which categories of habitat association, mode of locomotion, and feeding mode best predicted extinction risk. We also examined the individual categories of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List extinction drivers (e.g., agriculture and logging) threatening each species and determined the greatest threats for each of the four terrestrial vertebrate groups. We then quantified the sum of extinction drivers threatening each species to provide a multistressor perspective on threat. Cave dwelling amphibians (p < 0.01), arboreal quadrupedal mammals (all of which are primates) (p < 0.01), aerial and scavenging birds (p < 0.01), and pedal (i.e., walking) squamates (p < 0.01) were all disproportionately threatened with extinction in comparison with the other assessed ecological traits. Across all threatened vertebrate species in the study, the most common risk factors were agriculture, threatening 4491 species, followed by logging, threatening 3187 species, and then invasive species and disease, threatening 2053 species. Species at higher risk of extinction were simultaneously at risk from a greater number of threat types. If left unabated, the disproportionate loss of species with certain functional traits and increasing anthropogenic pressures are likely to disrupt ecosystem functions globally. A shift in focus from species- to trait-centric conservation practices will allow for protection of at-risk functional diversity from regional to global scales.","1611":"Chikungunya appeared during the second half of 2014 in Colombia. A prospective cohort study was carried to detect differences and severity between neonates and older children.

Additionally, off-duty police-perpetrated killings are reported differentially by the news media depending on the race of the victim.Our study used a convergent mixed-methods design. We examined off-duty police-perpetrated killings by victim race and gender, comparing absolute rates and rates relative to total police-perpetrated killings. [Correction added on 26 June 2023, after first online publication: 'policy-perpetrated' has been changed to 'police-perpetrated' in the preceding sentence.] We also conducted race-gender comparisons of the frequency of news media reporting of these killings, and whether reporting identified the perpetrator as an off-duty officer. We conducted thematic analysis of the narrative free-text field that accompanied quantitative data using grounded theory.Black men were the most frequent victims killed by off-duty police (39.3%) followed by white men (25.2%), Hispanic men (11.2%), white women (9.1%), men of unknown race (9.1%), and Black women (4.1%). Black women had the highest rate of off-duty\/total police-perpetrated killings relative to white men (rate\u2009=\u200912.82%, RR\u2009=\u20098.32, 95% CI: 4.43-15.63). There were threefold higher odds of news reporting of a police-perpetrated killing and the off-duty status of the officer for incidents with Black and Hispanic victims. Qualitative analysis revealed that off-duty officers intervened violently within their own social networks; their presence escalated situations; they intentionally obscured information about their lethal violence; they intervened while impaired; their victims were often in crisis; and their intervention posed harm and potential secondary traumatization to witnesses.The aim of this study was to examine rates of killings perpetrated by off-duty police and news coverage of those killings, by victim race and gender, and to qualitatively evaluate the contexts in which those killings occur.We used the Mapping Police Violence database to curate a dataset of killings perpetrated by off-duty police (2013-2021, N\u2009=\u2009242). We obtained data from Media Cloud to assess news coverage of each off-duty police-perpetrated killing.","1613":"Position tracking using cellular phones can provide fine-grained traveling data between and within cities on hourly and daily scales, giving us a feasible way to explore human mobility. However, such fine-grained data are traditionally owned by private companies and is extremely rare to be publicly available even for one city. Here, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the largest inter-city movement dataset using cellular phone logs. Specifically, our data set captures 3-million cellular devices and includes 70 million movements. These movements are measured at hourly intervals and span a week-long duration. Our measurements are from the southeast Sangliao Basin, Northeast China, which span three cities and one country with a collective population of 8 million people. The dynamic, weighted and directed mobility network of inter-urban divisions is released in simple formats, as well as divisions' GPS coordinates to motivate studies of human interactions within and between cities.","1614":"We sought to compare the costs of a nighttime pediatric telemedicine and medication delivery service per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted to the costs of current hospital emergency care per DALY averted from a societal perspective. We studied a nighttime pediatric telemedicine and medication delivery service and hospital emergency care in a semi-urban and rural region of Haiti. Costs of the two services were enumerated to represent the financial investments of both providers and patients. DALYs averted were calculated to represent the \"years lives lost\" and \"years lost to disability\" from diarrheal, respiratory, and skin (bacterial and scabies etiologies) disease among children from 0 to 9 years old. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated and compared with the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of Haiti ($1,177). Cost-effectiveness was defined as an incremental cost-effectiveness less than three times the per capita GDP of Haiti ($3,531). The total costs of the nighttime telemedicine and medication delivery service and hospital emergency care to society were $317,898 per year and $89,392 per year, respectively. The DALYs averted by the service and hospital emergency care were 199.76 and 22.37, respectively. Correspondingly, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is estimated at $1,288 signifying the service costs an additional $1,288 to avert one additional DALY. A scaled nighttime pediatric telemedicine and medication delivery service is likely a cost-effective alternative to hospital emergency care for preemergency pediatric conditions in Haiti, and possibly in similar lower-middle-income countries.","1615":"Accurate estimation of diarrhea incidence from facility-based surveillance requires estimating the population at risk and accounting for case patients who do not seek care. The Enterics for Global Health (EFGH) Shigella surveillance study will characterize population denominators and healthcare-seeking behavior proportions to calculate incidence rates of Shigella diarrhea in children aged 6-35 months across 7 sites in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.The methods presented herein aim to minimize the challenges associated with hybrid surveillance, such as poor parity between survey area coverage and facility coverage, population fluctuations, seasonal variability, and adjustments to care-seeking behavior.The Enterics for Global Health (EFGH) Shigella surveillance study will use a hybrid surveillance design, supplementing facility-based surveillance with population-based surveys to estimate population size and the proportion of children with diarrhea brought for care at EFGH health facilities. Continuous data collection over a 24 month period captures seasonality and ensures representative sampling of the population at risk during the period of facility-based enrollments. Study catchment areas are broken into randomized clusters, each sized to be feasibly enumerated by individual field teams.","1616":"In Arequipa, Peru, a large-scale vector control campaign has successfully reduced urban infestations of the Chagas disease vector, Triatoma infestans. In addition to preventing new infections with Trypanosoma cruzi (etiological agent of Chagas disease), the campaign produced a wealth of information about the distribution and density of vector infestations. We used these data to create vector infestation risk maps for the city in order to target the last few remaining infestations, which are unevenly distributed and difficult to pinpoint. Our maps, which are provided on a mobile app, display color-coded, individual house-level estimates of T. infestans infestation risk. Entomologic surveillance personnel can use the maps to select homes to inspect based on estimated risk of infestation, as well as keep track of which parts of a given neighborhood they have inspected to ensure even surveillance throughout the zone. However, the question then becomes, how do we encourage surveillance personnel to actually use these two functionalities of the risk map? As such, we carried out a series of rolling trials to test different incentive schemes designed to encourage the following two behaviors by entomologic surveillance personnel in Arequipa: (i) preferential inspections of homes shown as high risk on the maps, and (ii) even surveillance across the geographical distribution of a given area, which we term, 'spatial coverage.' These two behaviors together constituted what we termed, 'optimal map use.' We found that several incentives resulted in one of the two target behaviors, but just one incentive scheme based on the game of poker resulted in optimal map use. This poker-based incentive structure may be well-suited to improve entomological surveillance activities and other complex multi-objective tasks.","1617":"While the majority (74%) of pastoralist households had little to no formal education when compared to mixed (8%), over 70% of all households (pastoralists and mixed farmers) had heard of brucellosis and mentioned its clinical presentation in humans. However, fewer than 30% of all participants (pastoralists and mixed farmers) knew how brucellosis is transmitted between animals and humans or how its transmission can be prevented. Despite their comparable knowledge, significantly more seropositive pastoralists compared to mixed farmers engaged in risky practices including consuming unboiled milk (79.5% vs 1.7%, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and raw blood (28.3% vs 0.4%, p < 0.001), assisting in animal birth (43.0% vs 9.3%, p < 0.001), and handling raw hides (30.6% vs 5.5%, p < 0.001).The seroprevalence of brucellosis among nomadic pastoralists and their livestock in arid lands is reported to be over10-fold higher than non-pastoralists farmers and their livestock in Kenya. Here, we compared the seroprevalence of nomadic pastoralists and mixed farming with their knowledge of the disease and high-risk practices associated with brucellosis infection.Across-sectional study was conducted in two counties - Kiambu County where farmers primarily practice smallholder livestock production and crop farming, and Marsabit County where farmers practice nomadic pastoral livestock production. Stratified random sampling was applied, in which sublocations were initially selected based on predominant livestock production system, before selecting households using randomly generated geographical coordinates. In each household, up to three persons aged 5\u2009years and above were randomly selected, consented, and tested for Brucella spp IgG antibodies. A structured questionnaire was administered to the household head and selected individuals on disease knowledge and risky practices among the pastoralists and mixed farmers compared. Multivariable mixed effects logistic regression model was used to assess independent practices associated with human Brucella spp. IgG seropositivity.Nomadic pastoralists are more likely to engage in risky practices that promote Brucella Infection, probably because of their occupation and culture, despite having significant knowledge of the disease.","1618":"We initiated the systematic profiling of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex obtained from a subset of autopsied individuals enrolled in the Religious Orders Study (ROS) or the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), which are jointly designed prospective studies of aging and dementia with detailed, longitudinal cognitive phenotyping during life and a quantitative, structured neuropathologic examination after death. They include over 3,322 subjects. Here, we outline the first generation of data including genome-wide genotypes (n=2,090), whole genome sequencing (n=1,179), DNA methylation (n=740), chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing using an anti-Histone 3 Lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9Ac) antibody (n=712), RNA sequencing (n=638), and miRNA profile (n=702). Generation of other omic data including ATACseq, proteomic and metabolomics profiles is ongoing. Thanks to its prospective design and recruitment of older, non-demented individuals, these data can be repurposed to investigate a large number of syndromic and quantitative neuroscience phenotypes. The many subjects that are cognitively non-impaired at death also offer insights into the biology of the human brain in older non-impaired individuals.","1619":" a more useful metric for future management of the epidemic.","1620":"We developed a computational decision model that represented the clinical outcomes and diagnostic testing strategies for an infant born to a Chagas-positive woman in Mexico and evaluated the impact of vaccination.Currently, there are no solutions to prevent congenital transmission of Chagas disease during pregnancy, which affects 1-40% of pregnant women in Latin America and is associated with a 5% transmission risk. With therapeutic vaccines under development, now is the right time to determine the economic value of such a vaccine to prevent congenital transmission.We delineated the thresholds at which therapeutic vaccination of Chagas-positive pregnant women would be cost-effective and cost-saving, providing economic guidance for decision-makers to consider when developing and bringing such a vaccine to market.Compared to no vaccination, a 25% efficacious vaccine averted 125 [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 122-128] congenital cases, 1.9 (95% UI: 1.6-2.2) infant deaths, and 78 (95% UI: 66-91) DALYs per 10,000 infected pregnant women; a 50% efficacious vaccine averted 251 (95% UI: 248-254) cases, 3.8 (95% UI: 3.6-4.2) deaths, and 160 (95% UI: 148-171) DALYs; and a 75% efficacious vaccine averted 376 (95% UI: 374-378) cases, 5.8 (95% UI: 5.5-6.1) deaths, and 238 (95% UI: 227-249) DALYs.

Given potential adverse financial and psychosocial effects of campus closures, many institutions developed strategies to reopen campuses in the fall 2020 semester despite the ongoing threat of COVID-19. However, many institutions opted to have limited campus reopening to minimize potential risk of spread of SARS-CoV-2.To analyze how Boston University (BU) fully reopened its campus in the fall of 2020 and controlled COVID-19 transmission despite worsening transmission in Boston, Massachusetts.Between August and December 2020, BU conducted more than 500\u202f000 COVID-19 tests and identified 719 individuals with COVID-19, including 496 students (69.0%), 11 faculty (1.5%), and 212 staff (29.5%). Overall, 718 individuals, or 1.8% of the BU community, had test results positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of 837 close contacts traced, 86 individuals (10.3%) had test results positive for COVID-19. BU contact tracers identified a source of transmission for 370 individuals (51.5%), with 206 individuals (55.7%) identifying a non-BU source. Among 5 faculty and 84 staff with SARS-CoV-2 with a known source of infection, most reported a transmission source outside of BU (all 5 faculty members [100%] and 67 staff members [79.8%]). A BU source was identified by 108 of 183 undergraduate students with SARS-CoV-2 (59.0%) and 39 of 98 graduate students with SARS-CoV-2 (39.8%); notably, no transmission was traced to a classroom setting.In this case series of COVID-19 transmission, BU used a coordinated strategy of testing, contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine, with robust management and oversight, to control COVID-19 transmission in an urban university setting.This multifaceted intervention case series was conducted at a large urban university campus in Boston, Massachusetts, during the fall 2020 semester. The BU response included a high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction testing facility with capacity to deliver results in less than 24 hours; routine asymptomatic screening for COVID-19; daily health attestations; adherence monitoring and feedback; robust contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation in on-campus facilities; face mask use; enhanced hand hygiene; social distancing recommendations; dedensification of classrooms and public places; and enhancement of all building air systems.

Here, we estimate the reproduction number throughout the epidemic in Chile and study the effectiveness of control interventions especially the effectiveness of lockdowns by conducting short-term forecasts based on the early transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Chile's incidence curve displays early sub-exponential growth dynamics with the deceleration of growth parameter, p, estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8) and the reproduction number, R, estimated at 1.8 (95% CI: 1.6, 1.9). Our findings indicate that the control measures at the start of the epidemic significantly slowed down the spread of the virus. However, the relaxation of restrictions and spread of the virus in low-income neighborhoods in May led to a new surge of infections, followed by the reimposition of lockdowns in Greater Santiago and other municipalities. These measures have decelerated the virus spread with R estimated at ~0.96 (95% CI: 0.95, 0.98) as of November 2nd, 2020. The early sub-exponential growth trend (p ~0.8) of the COVID-19 epidemic transformed into a linear growth trend (p ~0.5) as of July 7th, 2020, after the reimposition of lockdowns. While the broad scale social distancing interventions have slowed the virus spread, the number of new COVID-19 cases continue to accrue, underscoring the need for persistent social distancing and active case detection and isolation efforts to maintain the epidemic under control.","1623":"The microbial communities that inhabit the distal gut of humans and other mammals exhibit large inter-individual variation. While host genetics is a known factor that influences gut microbiota composition, the mechanisms underlying this variation remain largely unknown. Bile acids (BAs) are hormones that are produced by the host and chemically modified by gut bacteria. BAs serve as environmental cues and nutrients to microbes, but they can also have antibacterial effects. We hypothesized that host genetic variation in BA metabolism and homeostasis influence gut microbiota composition. To address this, we used the Diversity Outbred (DO) stock, a population of genetically distinct mice derived from eight founder strains. We characterized the fecal microbiota composition and plasma and cecal BA profiles from 400 DO mice maintained on a high-fat high-sucrose diet for ~22 weeks. Using quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, we identified several genomic regions associated with variations in both bacterial and BA profiles. Notably, we found overlapping QTL for Turicibacter sp. and plasma cholic acid, which mapped to a locus containing the gene for the ileal bile acid transporter, Slc10a2. Mediation analysis and subsequent follow-up validation experiments suggest that differences in Slc10a2 gene expression associated with the different strains influences levels of both traits and revealed novel interactions between Turicibacter and BAs. This work illustrates how systems genetics can be utilized to generate testable hypotheses and provide insight into host-microbe interactions.","1624":"We paired a field survey of mosquito communities in agricultural, residential, and forested lands in rural southern Costa Rica with remotely sensed tree cover data. We compared mosquito community responses to tree cover surrounding survey sites measured across scales, and analyzed community responses to land use and environmental gradients.The results suggest that preservation and expansion of tree cover at local scales can protect biodiversity for a wide range of taxa, including arthropods, and also confer protection against disease vector occurrence. The identified spatial range of tree cover benefits can inform land management for conservation and public health protection.Land use change drives both biodiversity loss and zoonotic disease transmission in tropical countryside landscapes. Developing solutions for protecting countryside biodiversity, public health, and livelihoods requires understanding the scales at which habitat characteristics such as land cover shape biodiversity, especially for arthropods that transmit pathogens. Evidence increasingly shows that species richness for many taxa correlates with local tree cover.Tree cover was positively correlated with mosquito species richness, and negatively correlated with the presence of the common invasive dengue vector Aedes albopictus, particularly at small spatial scales of 80 - 200m. Land use predicted community composition and Ae. albopictus presence. Environmental gradients of tree cover, temperature, and elevation explained 7% of species turnover among survey sites.We investigated whether mosquito species richness, community composition, and presence of disease vector species responded to land use and tree cover - and if so, whether at spatial scales similar to other taxa.","1625":"Projecting the status quo (2023-2032), deaths per 100\u202fK people increase from 87.5 to 115.4, and CRC progressions per 100\u202fK people rise from 131.8 to 159.8. In 2032, improved screening access prevents 2.5 CRC deaths and 2.5 progressions per 100\u202fK people, with cumulative prevented 7\u202fK deaths and 9\u202fK progressions, respectively. Improved symptom evaluation access prevents 7.5 CRC deaths per 100\u202fK with no effect on progression, totaling 35\u202fK saved lives. A combined approach prevents 9.3 deaths and 1.8 progressions per 100\u202fK, or 41\u202fK and 7\u202fK cumulatively. The combined strategy prevents most deaths; however, there is a tradeoff: It prevents fewer CRC progressions than screening access improvement. Increasing the current annual colonoscopy capacity (200K) to sufficient capacity (681\u202fK), the combined strategy achieves the best results, preventing 15.0 CRC deaths and 10.3 CRC progressions per 100\u202fK people, or 54\u202fK and 30\u202fK cumulatively.We developed a system dynamics model to simulate CRC death and progression trends. We analyzed the impacts of increased access to screening via fecal immunochemical test and colonoscopy, improving access to CRC diagnosis among symptomatic individuals, and their combination.Low and middle-income countries face constraints for early colorectal cancer (CRC) detection, including restricted access to care and low colonoscopy capacity. Considering these constraints, we studied strategies for increasing access to early CRC detection and reducing CRC progression and mortality rates in Thailand.Until colonoscopy capacity increases, enhanced screening and symptom evaluation are needed simultaneously to curb CRC deaths, albeit not the best strategy for CRC progression prevention.","1626":"Malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis (TB) collectively account for several million deaths each year, with all three ranking among the top ten killers in low-income countries. Despite being caused by very different organisms, malaria, HIV, and TB present a suite of challenges for mathematical modellers that are particularly pronounced in these infections, but represent general problems in infectious disease modelling, and highlight many of the challenges described throughout this issue. Here, we describe some of the unifying challenges that arise in modelling malaria, HIV, and TB, including variation in dynamics within the host, diversity in the pathogen, and heterogeneity in human contact networks and behaviour. Through the lens of these three pathogens, we provide specific examples of the other challenges in this issue and discuss their implications for informing public health efforts. ","1627":"The crude prevalence of Plasmodium infection was 8.4% in 2016 and 3.6% in 2017. Living in a hotspot in 2016 did not predict Plasmodium risk at the individual or household level in 2017 overall, but living in a Plasmodium-positive household in 2016 strongly predicted living in a Plasmodium-positive household in 2017 (Risk Ratio, 5.00 [95% confidence interval, 2.09-11.96], P < .0001). There was no consistent evidence that malaria risk clustered in groups of socially connected individuals from different households.Clustering of Plasmodium infections at the household and hotspot level was assessed over 2 years in 3 villages in eastern Cambodia. Social and spatial autocorrelation statistics were calculated to assess clustering of malaria risk, and logistic regression was used to assess the effect of living in a malaria hotspot compared to living in a malaria-positive household in the first year of the study on risk of malaria infection in the second year.Malaria risk clustered more clearly in households than in hotspots over 2 years. Household-based strategies should be prioritized in malaria elimination programs in this region.Malaria \"hotspots\" have been proposed as potential intervention units for targeted malaria elimination. Little is known about hotspot formation and stability in settings outside sub-Saharan Africa.","1628":"Introducing pentavalent rotavirus vaccination into the French infant vaccination schedule would significantly reduce the burden of rotavirus disease in children, and could be cost-effective under plausible conditions.To determine the cost-effectiveness of the introduction of pentavalent rotavirus vaccination into the French infant vaccination schedule.Vaccination against rotavirus has shown great potential for reducing the primary cause of severe childhood gastroenteritis. Previous economic evaluations of rotavirus vaccination in France have not modeled the potential impact of vaccines on disease burden via reduced transmission.Our model predicts that rotavirus vaccination will decrease rotavirus gastroenteritis incidence and associated clinical outcomes in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, delay the seasonal peak of infection, and increase the age of infection. From the societal perspective, our base-case scenario predicts that vaccination coverage would be cost-effective at \u20ac115 or \u20ac135 per vaccine course at \u20ac28,500 and \u20ac39,500\/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, respectively, and suggests that almost 95% of the financial benefits will be recouped within the first 5 years following vaccination implementation. From the third-party payer perspective, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from \u20ac12,500 to \u20ac20,000\/QALY, respectively. Our uncertainty analysis suggests that findings were sensitive to various assumptions including the number of hospitalizations, outpatient visits, and the extent of QALY losses per rotavirus episode.We developed an age-structured model of rotavirus transmission calibrated to 6 years of French gastroenteritis incidence and vaccine clinical trial data. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of pentavalent rotavirus vaccination considering that 75% of infants would receive the three-dose vaccine course.","1629":"Microbes are present in high abundances in the environment and in human-associated microbiomes, often exceeding 1 million per ml. Viruses of microbes are present in even higher abundances and are important in shaping microbial populations, communities, and ecosystems. Given the relative specificity of viral infection, it is essential to identify the functional linkages between viruses and their microbial hosts, particularly given dynamic changes in virus and host abundances. Multiple approaches have been proposed to infer infection networks from time series of in situ communities, among which correlation-based approaches have emerged as the de facto standard. In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of correlation-based inference methods using an in silico approach. In doing so, we compare predicted networks to actual networks to assess the self-consistency of correlation-based inference. At odds with assumptions underlying its widespread use, we find that correlation is a poor predictor of interactions in the context of viral infection and lysis of microbial hosts. The failure to predict interactions holds for methods that leverage product-moment, time-lagged, and relative-abundance-based correlations. In closing, we discuss alternative inference methods, particularly model-based methods, as a means to infer interactions in complex microbial communities with viruses. IMPORTANCE Inferring interactions from population time series is an active and ongoing area of research. It is relevant across many biological systems-particularly in virus-microbe communities, but also in gene regulatory networks, neural networks, and ecological communities broadly. Correlation-based inference-using correlations to predict interactions-is widespread. However, it is well-known that \"correlation does not imply causation.\" Despite this, many studies apply correlation-based inference methods to experimental time series without first assessing the potential scope for accurate inference. Here, we find that several correlation-based inference methods fail to recover interactions within in silico virus-microbe communities, raising questions on their relevance when applied in situ.","1630":"We investigate the effects of external and autonomous global interaction fields on an adaptive network of social agents with an opinion formation dynamics based on a simple imitation rule. We study the competition between global fields and adaptive rewiring on the space of parameters of the system. The model represents an adaptive society subject to global mass media such as a directed opinion influence or feedback of endogenous cultural trends. We show that, in both situations, global mass media contribute to consensus and to prevent the fragmentation of the social network induced by the coevolutionary dynamics. We present a discussion of these results in the context of dynamical systems and opinion formation dynamics.","1631":"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become the architecture of choice for visual recognition tasks. However, these models are perceived as black boxes since there is a lack of understanding of the learned behavior from the underlying task of interest. This lack of transparency is a serious drawback, particularly in applications involving medical screening and diagnosis since poorly understood model behavior could adversely impact subsequent clinical decision-making. Recently, researchers have begun working on this issue and several methods have been proposed to visualize and understand the behavior of these models. We highlight the advantages offered through visualizing and understanding the weights, saliencies, class activation maps, and region of interest localizations in customized CNNs applied to the challenge of classifying parasitized and uninfected cells to aid in malaria screening. We provide an explanation for the models\u0092 classification decisions. We characterize, evaluate, and statistically validate the performance of different customized CNNs keeping every training subject\u0092s data separate from the validation set.","1632":"Despite a high prevalence of COVID-19 mitigation behaviors, there were likely millions who did not consistently practice these behaviors during the time of the highest COVID-19 incidence. In future infectious disease outbreak responses, public health authorities should also consider addressing disparities in mitigation practices through more targeted prevention messaging.Among 4654 participants, most (n=2727, 58.6%) were female, were non-Hispanic White (n=3063, 65.8%), were aged 55 years or older (n=2099, 45.1%), lived in the South (n=2275, 48.9%), lived in metropolitan areas (n=4186, 89.9%), had at least a bachelor's degree (n=2547, 54.7%), had an income of US $50,000-$99,000 (n=1445, 31%), and were privately insured (n=2734, 58.7%). The period prevalence of consistent mask wearing was 71.1% (sample-weighted 95% CI 68.8-73.3); consistent social distancing, 42.9% (95% CI 40.5-45.3); frequent handwashing, 55.0% (95% CI 52.3-57.7); and frequent hand sanitizing, 21.5% (95% CI 19.4-23.8). Mitigation behaviors were more prevalent among women, older persons, Black or Hispanic persons, those who were not college graduates, and service-oriented workers. LCA identified an optimal-mitigation class that consistently practiced all behaviors (n=2656, 67% of US adults), a low-mitigation class that inconsistently practiced all behaviors (n=771, 20.6%), and a class that had optimal masking and social distancing but a high frequency of hand hygiene (n=463, 12.4%).We used baseline survey data from a nationwide household probability sample to generate weighted estimates of mitigation behaviors: wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, and practicing hand hygiene. Weighted logistic regression explored differences in mitigation behaviors by demographics. Latent class analysis (LCA) identified patterns in mitigation behaviors.COVID-19 mitigation behaviors, such as wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, and practicing hand hygiene, have been and will remain vital to slowing the pandemic.This study aims to describe the period prevalence of consistent mask-wearing, social distancing, and hand hygiene practices during the peak of COVID-19 incidence (August-December 2020) and just before COVID-19 vaccine availability, overall and in demographic subgroups.","1633":"Overall, the preferred intervention type depended on the combination of the strength of symptom propagation and uptake. Given the importance of determining robust public health responses, we highlight the need to gather further data on symptom propagation, with our modelling framework acting as a template for future analysis.We propose a novel framework for incorporating different levels of symptom propagation into models of infectious disease transmission via a single parameter, \u03b1. Varying \u03b1 tunes the model from having no symptom propagation (\u03b1 = 0, as typically assumed) to one where symptoms always propagate (\u03b1 = 1). For parameters corresponding to three respiratory pathogens-seasonal influenza, pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2-we explored how symptom propagation impacted the relative epidemiological and health-economic performance of three interventions, conceptualised as vaccines with different actions: symptom-attenuating (labelled SA), infection-blocking (IB) and infection-blocking admitting only mild breakthrough infections (IB_MB). In the absence of interventions, with fixed underlying epidemiological parameters, stronger symptom propagation increased the proportion of cases that were severe. For SA and IB_MB, interventions were more effective at reducing prevalence (all infections and severe cases) for higher strengths of symptom propagation. For IB, symptom propagation had no impact on effectiveness, and for seasonal influenza this intervention type was more effective than SA at reducing severe infections for all strengths of symptom propagation. For pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2, at low intervention uptake, SA was more effective than IB for all levels of symptom propagation; for high uptake, SA only became more effective under strong symptom propagation. Health economic assessments found that, for SA-type interventions, the amount one could spend on control whilst maintaining a cost-effective intervention (termed threshold unit intervention cost) was very sensitive to the strength of symptom propagation.Respiratory pathogens inflict a substantial burden on public health and the economy. Although the severity of symptoms caused by these pathogens can vary from asymptomatic to fatal, the factors that determine symptom severity are not fully understood. Correlations in symptoms between infector-infectee pairs, for which evidence is accumulating, can generate large-scale clusters of severe infections that could be devastating to those most at risk, whilst also conceivably leading to chains of mild or asymptomatic infections that generate widespread immunity with minimal cost to public health. Although this effect could be harnessed to amplify the impact of interventions that reduce symptom severity, the mechanistic representation of symptom propagation within mathematical and health economic modelling of respiratory diseases is understudied.","1634":"Although human mobility is considered critical for the spread of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) both locally and globally, the extent to which such an association is impacted by social vulnerability remains unclear. Here, using multisource epidemiological and socioeconomic data of US counties, we develop a COVID-19 pandemic vulnerability index (CPVI) to quantify their levels of social vulnerability and examine how social vulnerability moderated the influence of mobility on disease transmissibility (represented by the effective reproduction number, R t) during the US summer epidemic wave of 2020. We find that counties in the top CPVI quintile suffered almost double in regard to COVID-19 transmission (45.02% days with an R t higher than 1) from mobility, particularly intracounty mobility, compared to counties in the lowest quintile (21.90%). In contrast, counties in the bottom CPVI quintile were only slightly affected by the level of mobility. As such, a 25% intracounty mobility change was associated with a 15.28% R t change for counties in the top CPVI quintile, which is eight times the 1.81% R t change for those in the lowest quintile. These findings suggest the need to account for the vulnerability of communities when making social distancing measures against mobility in the future.","1635":"The OneFlorida Data Trust is a centralized research patient data repository created and managed by the OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium (\"OneFlorida\"). It comprises structured electronic health record (EHR), administrative claims, tumor registry, death, and other data on 17.2 million individuals who received healthcare in Florida between January 2012 and the present. Ten healthcare systems in Miami, Orlando, Tampa, Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Gainesville, and rural areas of Florida contribute EHR data, covering the major metropolitan regions in Florida. Deduplication of patients is accomplished via privacy-preserving entity resolution (precision 0.97-0.99, recall 0.75), thereby linking patients' EHR, claims, and death data. Another unique feature is the establishment of mother-baby relationships via Florida vital statistics data. Research usage has been significant, including major studies launched in the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (\"PCORnet\"), where OneFlorida is 1 of 9 clinical research networks. The Data Trust's robust, centralized, statewide data are a valuable and relatively unique research resource.","1636":"The trial involves middle school students that positions them to become actors in dengue knowledge transfer to their communities and take a leadership role in the delivery of vector control interventions and monitoring methods. Following this rationale, we believe that students can become change agents of decentralized vector surveillance and sustainable disease control in line with recent new paradigms in integrated and participatory vector surveillance and control. This provides an opportunity to operationalize transdisciplinary research towards sustainable health development. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and political instability in Myanmar the project has been terminated by the donor, but the protocol will be helpful for potential future implementation of the project in Myanmar and\/or elsewhere.Registration: This trial was registered in the ISRCTN Registry on 31 May 2022 ( https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/ISRCTN78254298).Here we describe a cluster randomized controlled trial to be conducted in 46 school catchment areas in two townships in Yangon, Myanmar. The outcome measures are dengue cases confirmed by rapid diagnostic test in the townships, dengue incidence in schools, entomological indices, knowledge, attitudes and practice, behavior, and engagement.Dengue is the most common and widespread mosquito-borne arboviral disease globally estimated to cause >390 million infections and >20,000 deaths annually. There are no effective preventive drugs and the newly introduced vaccines are not yet available. Control of dengue transmission still relies primarily on mosquito vector control. Although most vector control methods currently used by national dengue control programs may temporarily reduce mosquito populations, there is little evidence that they affect transmission. There is an urgent need for innovative, participatory, effective, and locally adapted approaches for sustainable vector control and monitoring in which students can be particularly relevant contributors and to demonstrate a clear link between vector reduction and dengue transmission reduction, using tools that are inexpensive and easy to use by local communities in a sustainable manner.","1637":"Objective: to establish the association between obesity and overweight, menopausal symptoms and impaired quality of life in a group of Colombian women Methods: cross-sectional study that is part of the proyecto de investigaci\u00f3n \u0093Calidad de Vida en la Menopausia y Etnias Colombianas (CAVIMEC)\u0094, involving indigenous, black and mestizo Colombian women of the Caribe and Pacific coasts. Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) validated Spanish version was applied anonymously and voluntarily in their community of residence with door to door visits. Women were grouped according to Body Mass Index (BMI). Results: study population: 2167 women. Average age: 48.6 \u00b1 5.9 years. BMI: 25.4 \u00b1 4.2. Normal BMI: 44.2%, underweight: 3.5%, overweight: 40.1%, obese: 12.0%. Premenopausal: 35.0% and postmenopausal women: 41.5%. Average age of menopause: 47.4 \u00b1 3.7 and mean number of years since the last bleeding: 6.0 \u00b1 4.1 years. The average age of menopause increased slightly with increasing BMI (p = 0.027). The prevalence of all menopausal symptoms and the deterioration of dimensions increased with increasing BMI. Overweight had adjusted OR: 1.61 (1.35-1.93) and obesity had adjusted OR 1.40 (1.06-1.84) for severe impairment of quality of life. Conclusions: overweight and obesity are associated with increased menopausal symptoms, greater somatic, psychological and urogenital impairment and more severe impairment of quality of life.","1638":"Coevolution has long been thought to drive the exaggeration of traits, promote major evolutionary transitions such as the evolution of sexual reproduction and influence epidemiological dynamics. Despite coevolution's long suspected importance, we have yet to develop a quantitative understanding of its strength and prevalence because we lack generally applicable statistical methods that yield numerical estimates for coevolution's strength and significance in the wild. Here, we develop a novel method that derives maximum likelihood estimates for the strength of direct pairwise coevolution by coupling a well-established coevolutionary model to spatially structured phenotypic data. Applying our method to two well-studied interactions reveals evidence for coevolution in both systems. Broad application of this approach has the potential to further resolve long-standing evolutionary debates such as the role species interactions play in the evolution of sexual reproduction and the organisation of ecological communities.","1639":"Coccidioidomycosis is an emerging fungal infection caused by inhalation of Coccidioides spp. spores. While airborne dispersal is critical to Coccidioides transmission, limited recovery of the pathogen from air has hindered understanding of the aerosolization and transport of spores. Here, we examine uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) with portable, active air samplers as a novel means of capturing aerosolized Coccidioides and characterizing emissions and exposure risk. We sampled in September 2023 in eastern San Luis Obispo County, California, in an area with confirmed Coccidioides immitis in soils. We completed 41 20-minute flights across 14 sites using UAS equipped with an 8 L\/min bioaerosol sampler and a low-cost particulate matter sensor. We sampled source soils and air under ambient conditions using one UAS at 1-10 m altitude, and under a simulated high-dust event using two UAS, one at <2 m altitude and one at 5-12 m. We detected Coccidioides DNA in two of 41 air samples (4.9%), both under ambient conditions at 8 m altitude, representing the highest known altitude of airborne Coccidioides detection. Spatially explicit UAS-based sampling could enhance understanding of Coccidioides aerobiology and enable detection in hard-to-reach or hazardous air masses, including dust storms and wildland fire smoke.","1640":"We report on and evaluate the process and findings of a real-time modeling exercise in response to an outbreak of measles in Lola prefecture, Guinea, in early 2015 in the wake of the Ebola crisis. Multiple statistical methods for the estimation of the size of the susceptible (i.e., unvaccinated) population were applied to weekly reported measles case data on seven subprefectures throughout Lola. Stochastic compartmental models were used to project future measles incidence in each subprefecture in both an initial and a follow-up iteration of forecasting. Measles susceptibility among 1- to 5-year-olds was estimated to be between 24% and 43% at the beginning of the outbreak. Based on this high baseline susceptibility, initial projections forecasted a large outbreak occurring over approximately 10 weeks and infecting 40 children per 1,000. Subsequent forecasts based on updated data mitigated this initial projection, but still predicted a significant outbreak. A catch-up vaccination campaign took place at the same time as this second forecast and measles cases quickly receded. Of note, case reports used to fit models changed significantly between forecast rounds. Model-based projections of both current population risk and future incidence can help in setting priorities and planning during an outbreak response. A swiftly changing situation on the ground, coupled with data uncertainties and the need to adjust standard analytical approaches to deal with sparse data, presents significant challenges. Appropriate presentation of results as planning scenarios, as well as presentations of uncertainty and two-way communication, is essential to the effective use of modeling studies in outbreak response.","1641":"The quick advancement of digital technology through artificial intelligence has made it possible to deploy machine learning to predict stroke outcomes. Our aim is to examine the trend of machine learning applications in stroke-related research over the past 50 years. We used search terms stroke and machine learning to search for English versions of original and review articles and conference proceedings published over the past 50 years in Scopus and Web of Science databases. The Biblioshiny web application was utilized for the analysis. The trend of publication and prominent authors and journals were analyzed and identified. The collaborative network between countries was mapped, and a thematic map was used to monitor the authors' trending keywords. In total, 10,535 publications authored by 44,990 authors from 2,212 sources were retrieved. Two distinct clusters of collaborative network nodes were observed, with the United States serving as a connecting node. Three terms - deep learning, algorithms, and neural networks - are observed in the early stages of the emerging theme. Overall, international research collaborations, the establishment of global research initiatives, the development of computational science, and the availability of big data have facilitated the pervasive use of machine learning techniques in stroke research.","1642":"Analysis of monthly MRSA incidence from longitudinal insurance claims using the Merative MarketScan Commercial and Medicare (2001-2021) databases.Households with \u22652 family members enrolled in the same insurance plan for the entire month.Estimate the risk for household transmission of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) following exposure to infected family members or family members recently discharged from a hospital.A total of 157,944,708 enrollees were included and 424,512 cases of MRSA were identified. Across all included enrollees, exposure to a family member with MRSA in the prior 30 days was associated with significantly increased risk of infection (IRR: 71.03 [95% CI, 67.73-74.50]). After removing enrollees who were hospitalized or exposed to a family member with MRSA, exposure to a family member who was recently discharged from the hospital was associated with increased risk of infection (IRR: 1.44 [95% CI, 1.39-1.49]) and the risk of infection increased with the duration of the family member's hospital stay (P value < .001).Exposure to a recently hospitalized and discharged family member increased the risk of MRSA infection in a household even when the hospitalized family member was not diagnosed with MRSA.We estimated a monthly incidence model, where enrollees were binned into monthly enrollment strata defined by demographic, patient, and exposure characteristics. Monthly incidence within each stratum was computed, and a regression analysis was used to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) associated with household exposures of interest while accounting for potential confounding factors.Visits to inpatient, emergency department, and outpatient settings.","1643":" A major goal of HIV-1 vaccine research is to design vaccine candidates that elicit potent broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Different viral features have been associated with the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies, including the glycan shield on the surface of the HIV-1 Envelope (Env). Here, we analyzed data from two cohorts of individuals who were followed from early infection to several years after infection spanning multiple HIV-1 subtypes. We compared Env glycan features in HIV-1 sequences obtained in early infection to the potency and breadth of neutralizing antibodies measured one to three years after infection. We found limited evidence of glycan shield properties that associate with the development of neutralization breadth in these cohorts. These results may have important implications for antigen design in future vaccine strategies and emphasize that HIV-1 vaccines will need to rely on a complex set of properties to elicit neutralization breadth.","1644":"In the wake of the Rohingya population's mass migration from Myanmar, one of the world's largest refugee settlements was constructed in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh to accommodate nearly 900,000 new refugees. Refugee populations are particularly vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks due to many population and environmental factors. A large measles outbreak, with over 1700 cases, occurred among the Rohingya population between September and November 2017. Here, we estimate key epidemiological parameters and use a dynamic mathematical model of measles transmission to evaluate the effectiveness of the reactive vaccination campaigns in the refugee camps. We also estimate the potential for subsequent outbreaks under different vaccination coverage scenarios. Our modeling results highlight the success of the vaccination campaigns in rapidly curbing transmission and emphasize the public health importance of maintaining high levels of vaccination in this population, where high birth rates and historically low vaccination coverage rates create suitable conditions for future measles outbreaks.","1645":"Seasonal influenza viruses repeatedly infect humans in part because they rapidly change their antigenic properties and evade host immune responses, necessitating frequent updates of the vaccine composition. Accurate predictions of strains circulating in the future could therefore improve the vaccine match. Here, we studied the predictability of frequency dynamics and fixation of amino acid substitutions. Current frequency was the strongest predictor of eventual fixation, as expected in neutral evolution. Other properties, such as occurrence in previously characterized epitopes or high Local Branching Index (LBI) had little predictive power. Parallel evolution was found to be moderately predictive of fixation. Although the LBI had little power to predict frequency dynamics, it was still successful at picking strains representative of future populations. The latter is due to a tendency of the LBI to be high for consensus-like sequences that are closer to the future than the average sequence. Simulations of models of adapting populations, in contrast, show clear signals of predictability. This indicates that the evolution of influenza HA and NA, while driven by strong selection pressure to change, is poorly described by common models of directional selection such as traveling fitness waves.","1646":"\u00a0The finding of radio ownership and reduced EVD transmission risk suggests that the use of radio messaging for control and prevention purposes may have been crucial in reducing the EVD transmission risk in certain districts, although this association requires further study. Future research should examine the etiologic relationships between the identified risk factors and human-to-human transmission of EVD with a focus on factors related to population mobility and healthcare accessibility, which are critical features of epidemic propagation and control.Although many studies have investigated the probability of Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks while other studies have simulated the size and speed of EVD outbreaks, few have investigated the environmental and population-level predictors of Ebola transmission once an outbreak is underway. Identifying strong predictors of transmission could help guide and target limited public health resources during an EVD outbreak. We examined several environmental and population-level demographic predictors of EVD risk from the West African epidemic.We obtained district-level estimates from the World Health Organization EVD case data, demographic indicators obtained from the Demographic and Health surveys, and satellite-derived temperature, rainfall, and land cover estimates. A Bayesian hierarchical Poisson model was used to estimate EVD risk and to evaluate the spatial variability explained by the selected predictors.\u00a0We found that districts had greater risk of EVD with increasing proportion of households not possessing a radio (RR 2.79, 0.90-8.78; RR 4.23, 1.16-15.93), increasing rainfall (RR 2.18; 0.66-7.20; 5.34, 1.20-23.90), and urban land cover (RR 4.87, 1.56-15.40; RR 5.74, 1.68-19.67).","1647":"Seasonal influenza epidemics occur each winter season in temperate zones, involving up to 650,000 deaths each year globally. A published study demonstrated that the circulation of one influenza virus type during early influenza season in the United States interferes with the activity of other influenza virus types. However, this finding has yet to be validated in other settings. In the present work, we investigated the interaction among seasonal influenza viruses (A\/H1N1, A\/H3N2 and B) in Japan. Sentinel and virus surveillance data were used to estimate the type-specific incidence from 2010 to 2019, and statistical correlations among the type-specific incidence were investigated. We identified significant negative correlations between incidence of the dominant virus and the complementary incidence. When correlation was identified during the course of an epidemic, a linear regression model accurately predicted the epidemic size of a particular virus type before the epidemic peak. The peak of influenza type B took place later in the season than that of influenza A, although the epidemic peaks of influenza A\/H1N1 and A\/H3N2 nearly coincided. Given the interaction among different influenza viruses, underlying mechanisms including age and spatial dependence should be explored in future.","1648":"Factors and processes determining heterogeneous ('patchy') population distributions in natural environments have long been a major focus in ecology. Existing theoretical approaches proved to be successful in explaining vegetation patterns. In the case of animal populations, existing theories are at most conceptual: they may suggest a qualitative explanation but largely fail to explain patchiness quantitatively. We aim to bridge this knowledge gap. We present a new mechanism of self-organized formation of a patchy spatial population distribution. A factor that was under-appreciated by pattern formation theories is animal sociability, which may result in density dependent movement behaviour. Our approach was inspired by a recent project on movement and distribution of slugs in arable fields. The project discovered a strongly heterogeneous slug distribution and a specific density dependent individual movement. In this paper, we bring these two findings together. We develop a model of density dependent animal movement to account for the switch in the movement behaviour when the local population density exceeds a certain threshold. The model is fully parameterized using the field data. We then show that the model produces spatial patterns with properties closely resembling those observed in the field, in particular to exhibit similar values of the aggregation index.","1649":"The COVID-19 pandemic has overrun hospital systems while exacerbating economic hardship and food insecurity on a global scale. In an effort to understand how early action to find and control the virus is associated with cumulative outcomes, we explored how country-level testing capacity affects later COVID-19 mortality.Higher early testing implementation, as indicated by more cumulative tests per case when mortality was still low, was associated with a lower risk for higher per capita deaths. A sample finding indicated that a higher cumulative number of tests administered per case at the time of six deaths per million persons was associated with a lower risk of reaching 15 deaths per million persons, after adjustment for all confounders (HR\u2009=\u20090.909; P\u2009=\u20090.0001).We used the Our World in Data database to explore testing and mortality records in 27 countries from December 31, 2019, to September 30, 2020; we applied Cox proportional hazards regression to determine the relationship between early COVID-19 testing capacity (cumulative tests per case) and later COVID-19 mortality (time to specified mortality thresholds), adjusting for country-level confounders, including median age, GDP, hospital bed capacity, population density, and nonpharmaceutical interventions.Countries that developed stronger COVID-19 testing capacity at early timepoints, as measured by tests administered per case identified, experienced a slower increase of deaths per capita. Thus, this study operationalizes the value of testing and provides empirical evidence that stronger testing capacity at early timepoints is associated with reduced mortality and improved pandemic control.","1650":", is a fixed, whole cell vaccine (WCV) licensed solely for use in Australia. C. burnetii WCV administration is associated with a dermal hypersensitivity reaction in people with pre-existing immunity to C. burnetii, limiting wider use. Consequently, a less reactogenic vaccine is needed. Here, we investigated contributions of the C. burnetii Dot\/Icm type IVB secretion system (T4BSS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in protection and reactogenicity of fixed WCVs. A 32.5\u2009kb region containing 23 dot\/icm genes was deleted in the virulent Nine Mile phase I (NMI) strain and the resulting mutant was evaluated in guinea pig models of C. burnetii infection, vaccination-challenge, and post-vaccination hypersensitivity. The NMI \u2206dot\/icm strain was avirulent, protective as a WCV against a robust C. burnetii challenge, and displayed potentially altered reactogenicity compared to NMI. Nine Mile phase II (NMII) strains of C. burnetii that produce rough LPS, were similarly tested. NMI was significantly more protective than NMII as a WCV; however, both vaccines exhibited similar reactogenicity. Collectively, our results indicate that, like phase I LPS, the T4BSS is required for full virulence by C. burnetii. Conversely, unlike phase I LPS, the T4BSS is not required for vaccine-induced protection. LPS length does not appear to contribute to reactogenicity while the T4BSS may contribute to this response. NMI \u2206dot\/icm represents an avirulent phase I strain with full vaccine efficacy, illustrating the potential of genetically modified C. burnetii as improved WCVs.","1651":"An outbreak in China in April 2013 of human illnesses due to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus provided reason for US public health officials to revisit existing national pandemic response plans. We built a spreadsheet model to examine the potential demand for invasive mechanical ventilation (excluding \"rescue therapy\" ventilation). We considered scenarios of either 20% or 30% gross influenza clinical attack rate (CAR), with a \"low severity\" scenario with case fatality rates (CFR) of 0.05%-0.1%, or a \"high severity\" scenario (CFR: 0.25%-0.5%). We used rates-of-influenza-related illness to calculate the numbers of potential clinical cases, hospitalizations, admissions to intensive care units, and need for mechanical ventilation. We assumed 10 days ventilator use per ventilated patient, 13% of total ventilator demand will occur at peak, and a 33.7% weighted average mortality risk while on a ventilator. At peak, for a 20% CAR, low severity scenario, an additional 7000 to 11,000 ventilators will be needed, averting a pandemic total of 35,000 to 55,000 deaths. A 30% CAR, high severity scenario, will need approximately 35,000 to 60,500 additional ventilators, averting a pandemic total 178,000 to 308,000 deaths. Estimates of deaths averted may not be realized because successful ventilation also depends on sufficient numbers of suitably trained staff, needed supplies (eg, drugs, reliable oxygen sources, suction apparatus, circuits, and monitoring equipment) and timely ability to match access to ventilators with critically ill cases. There is a clear challenge to plan and prepare to meet demands for mechanical ventilators for a future severe pandemic.","1652":"Prior applications of machine learning to population health have relied on conventional model assessment criteria, limiting the utility of models as decision supports for public health practitioners. To facilitate practitioner use of machine learning as decision support for area-level intervention, this study developed and applied four practice-based predictive model evaluation criteria (implementation capacity, preventive potential, health equity, and jurisdictional practicalities). We used a case study of overdose prevention in Rhode Island to illustrate how these criteria could inform public health practice and health equity promotion. We used Rhode Island overdose mortality records from January 2016 to June 2020 (N=1,408) and neighborhood-level Census data. We learned two disparate machine learning models, Gaussian process and random forest, to illustrate the comparative utility of our criteria to guide interventions. Our models predicted 7.5-36.4% of overdose deaths during the test period, illustrating the preventive potential of overdose interventions assuming 5-20% statewide implementation capacities for neighborhood-level resource deployment. We described the health equity implications of predictive modeling to guide interventions along urbanicity, racial\/ethnic composition, and poverty. In sum, our study discussed considerations to complement predictive model evaluation criteria and inform the prevention and mitigation of spatially dynamic public health problems across the breadth of practice.","1653":"The interventions focused on youth were high coverage HIV testing (80% of youth), treatment at diagnosis (TasP, i.e., immediate start of antiretroviral therapy [ART]) and 10% increased condom usage for HIV-positive diagnosed youth, male circumcision for HIV-negative young men, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for high-risk HIV-negative females (ages 20-24 years), and cash transfer for in-school HIV-negative girls (ages 15-19 years). Permutations of these were compared to adult-focused HIV testing coverage with condoms and TasP.The youth-focused strategy with ART treatment at diagnosis and condom use without adding interventions for HIV-negative youth performed better than the adult-focused strategy with adult testing reaching 50-60% coverage and TasP\/condoms. Over the long term, the youth-focused strategy approached the performance of 70% adult testing and TasP\/condoms. When high coverage male circumcision also is added to the youth-focused strategy, the combined intervention outperformed the adult-focused strategy with 70% testing, for at least 35 years by averting 94,000 more infections, averting 5.0 million more disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and saving US$46.0 million over this period. The addition of prevention interventions beyond circumcision to the youth-focused strategy would be more beneficial if HIV care costs are high, or when program delivery costs are relatively high for programs encompassing HIV testing coverage exceeding 70%, TasP and condoms to HIV-infected adults compared to combination prevention programs among youth.We compared the impact and costs of HIV prevention strategies focusing on youth (15-24 year-old persons) versus on adults (15+ year-old persons), in a high-HIV burden context of a large generalized epidemic.Compartmental age-structured mathematical model of HIV transmission in Nyanza, Kenya.For at least the next three decades, focusing in high burden settings on high coverage HIV testing, ART treatment upon diagnosis, condoms and male circumcision among youth may outperform adult-focused ART treatment upon diagnosis programs, unless the adult testing coverage in these programs reaches very high levels (>70% of all adults reached) at similar program costs. Our results indicate the potential importance of age-targeting for HIV prevention in the current era of 'test and start, ending AIDS' goals to ameliorate the HIV epidemic globally.","1654":"An individual's antibody titers to influenza A strains are a result of the complicated interplay between infection history, cross-reactivity, immune waning, and other factors. It has been challenging to disentangle how population-level patterns of humoral immunity change as a function of age, calendar year, and birth cohort from cross-sectional data alone. We analyzed 1,589 longitudinal sera samples from 260 children across three studies in Nicaragua, 2006-16. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers were determined against four H3N2 strains, one H1N1 strain, and two H1N1pdm strains. We assessed temporal patterns of HAI titers using an age-period-cohort modeling framework. We found that titers against a given virus depended on calendar year of serum collection and birth cohort but not on age. Titer cohort patterns were better described by participants' ages relative to year of likely introduction of the virus's antigenic cluster than by age relative to year of strain introduction or by year of birth. These cohort effects may be driven by a decreasing likelihood of early-life infection after cluster introduction and by more broadly reactive antibodies at a young age. H3N2 and H1N1 viruses had qualitatively distinct cohort patterns, with cohort patterns of titers to specific H3N2 strains reaching their peak in children born 3 years prior to that virus's antigenic cluster introduction and with titers to H1N1 and H1N1pdm strains peaking for children born 1-2 years prior to cluster introduction but not being dramatically lower for older children. Ultimately, specific patterns of strain circulation and antigenic cluster introduction may drive population-level antibody titer patterns in children.","1655":"Data on vaccine-preventable disease incidence and mortality from Vietnam's national surveillance was analysed to estimate the likely impact that vaccination in 1980-2010 may have had. Adjustment for under-reporting was made by examining trends in reported mumps incidence and in case-fatality risks for each disease. The same data were separately analysed using the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) to give an alternative estimate of impact. The financial cost of EPI in 1996-2010 was also estimated from the perspective of service provider.Countries like Vietnam transitioning to middle-income status increasingly bear the cost of both existing and new vaccines. However, the impact and cost-effectiveness of the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) as a whole has never been assessed on a country level.Two separate approaches to assessing EPI impact in Vietnam give different quantitative results but a common conclusion: that EPI has made a substantial impact on mortality and represents good value for money.National surveillance data suggests that up to 5.7 million diseases cases and 26,000 deaths may have been prevented by EPI. Analysis using LiST suggests that even more deaths (370,000) may have been prevented by measles and pertussis vaccination alone. The cost-effectiveness of EPI is estimated to be around $1000-$27,000 per death prevented.","1656":"Among the 30 non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions in the Omicron S-gene are 13 that have only rarely been seen in other SARS-CoV-2 sequences. These mutations cluster within three functionally important regions of the S-gene at sites that will likely impact (i) interactions between subunits of the Spike trimer and the predisposition of subunits to shift from down to up configurations, (ii) interactions of Spike with ACE2 receptors, and (iii) the priming of Spike for membrane fusion. We show here that, based on both the rarity of these 13 mutations in intrapatient sequencing reads and patterns of selection at the codon sites where the mutations occur in SARS-CoV-2 and related sarbecoviruses, prior to the emergence of Omicron the mutations would have been predicted to decrease the fitness of any virus within which they occurred. We further propose that the mutations in each of the three clusters therefore cooperatively interact to both mitigate their individual fitness costs, and, in combination with other mutations, adaptively alter the function of Spike. Given the evident epidemic growth advantages of Omicron over all previously known SARS-CoV-2 lineages, it is crucial to determine both how such complex and highly adaptive mutation constellations were assembled within the Omicron S-gene, and why, despite unprecedented global genomic surveillance efforts, the early stages of this assembly process went completely undetected.","1657":"To increase vaccination coverage, it is essential to understand the vaccine decision-making process. High population coverage is required to obtain herd immunity and to protect vulnerable groups in terms of age (e.g. the very young) or health (e.g. immunodeficiency). Vaccine confidence and coverage in South Africa are relatively low, opening the window for sustained outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in a country facing one of the most severe HIV epidemics in the world. To capture the vaccine-related decision-making process in South Africa, we performed a discrete choice experiment with 1200 participants in December 2017. We asked for their preferences with respect to (1) vaccine effectiveness, (2) vaccine-preventable burden of disease, (3) accessibility of the vaccine in terms of co-payment and prescription requirements, (4) frequency of mild vaccine-related side-effects, (5) population vaccination coverage and (6) local vaccination coverage. We distinguished between decision-making for vaccines administered to the participant, and for vaccines administered to their youngest child. We analyzed the data for each of these groups using a panel mixed logit model and found similar results for decisions to vaccinate oneself or one's child. Vaccine effectiveness was the most important attribute followed by population coverage and burden of disease. Local coverage and accessibility were also important determinants of vaccination behavior, but to a lesser extent. Regarding population and local coverage, we observed a positive effect on vaccine utility indicating the potential of peer influence. As such, social normative influence could be exploited to increase vaccination confidence and coverage. With respect to vaccine-preventable burden of the disease, the marginal utilities showed disease severity to be more important than frequency of disease. Policymakers and health care workers should stress the effectiveness of vaccines together with the severity of vaccine-preventable diseases.","1658":"Detailed hepatitis C virus (HCV) kinetics modelling is scarce in patients with advanced liver disease receiving direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Due to budget restrictions, patients and health systems would benefit from the shortest possible treatment course. We investigated whether modelling very early HCV kinetics in cirrhotic patients under DAAs therapy could be used to individualize care and reduce treatment duration to achieve cure. ) was significantly shorter in patients with CTP <7, LSM <21\u00a0kPa or MELD 7 and a LSM \u226521\u00a0kPa were significantly (P\u00a0=\u00a00.016) associated with longer CL-EF.The study provides insights into HCV dynamics during DAAs therapy in patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. Viral kinetics modelling suggests that treatment duration may be optimized in patients with compensated cirrhosis.We included 74 patients with HCV-related cirrhosis who received interferon-free treatments for 12-24\u00a0weeks. HCV genotype, liver disease stage and treatment regimen were recorded. Viral load was determined prospectively at very frequent intervals until target not detected (TND, <15\u00a0IU\/mL). A viral kinetic model was used to predict time to cure based on HCV clearance in extracellular body fluid (CL-EF).","1659":"Monkeypox virus (MPXV) has spread globally. Emerging studies have now provided evidence regarding\u00a0MPXV transmission, that can inform rational evidence-based policies and reduce misinformation on this topic. We aimed to review the evidence on transmission of the virus. Real-world studies have isolated viable viruses from high-touch surfaces for as long as 15 days. Strong evidence suggests that the current circulating monkeypox\u00a0(mpox) has evolved from previous outbreaks outside of Africa, but it is yet unknown whether these mutations may lead to an inherently increased infectivity of the virus. Strong evidence also suggests that the main route of current\u00a0MPXV transmission is sexual; through either close contact or directly, with detection of culturable virus in saliva, nasopharynx, and sperm for prolonged periods and the presence of rashes mainly in genital areas. The milder clinical presentations and the potential presence of presymptomatic transmission in the current circulating variant compared to previous clades, as well as the dominance of spread amongst men who have sex with men (MSMs) suggests that mpox has a developed distinct clinical phenotype that has increased its transmissibility. Increased public awareness of MPXV transmission modalities may lead to earlier detection of the spillover of new cases into other groups.","1660":"We performed a scoping review on the scientific literature of the proposed topic covering the period January 2021 to September 2022, in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR guidelines for scoping reviews.The evidence from the literature we reviewed tends to indicate positive direct and indirect effects from the use of COVID-19 passes. A major limitation to establishing this firmly is the entanglement of individual effects of multiple measures being implemented simultaneously.Out of a yield of 4,693 publications, 45 studies from multiple countries were retained for full-text review. The results suggest that implementing COVID-19 passes tends to reduce the incidence of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19. The use of COVID-19 passes was also shown to improve overall vaccination uptake and intention, but not in people who hold strong anti-COVID-19 vaccine beliefs.Policymakers have struggled to maintain SARS-CoV-2 transmission at levels that are manageable to contain the COVID-19 disease burden while enabling a maximum of societal and economic activities. One of the tools that have been used to facilitate this is the so-called \"COVID-19 pass\". We aimed to document current evidence on the effectiveness of COVID-19 passes, distinguishing their indirect effects by improving vaccination intention and uptake from their direct effects on COVID-19 transmission measured by the incidence of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.","1661":"A global shortage of cholera vaccines has increased the use of single-dose regimens, rather than the standard two-dose regimen. There is sparse evidence on single-dose protection, particularly in children. In 2020, a mass vaccination campaign was conducted in Uvira, an endemic urban setting in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, resulting in largely single-dose coverage. We examined the effectiveness of a single-dose of the oral cholera vaccine Euvichol-Plus in this high-burden setting.Wellcome Trust and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.We enrolled 658 individuals with confirmed cholera and 2274 matched individuals for the control group. 99 (15\u00b71%) individuals in the case group were younger than 5 years at the time of vaccination. The adjusted single-dose vaccine effectiveness was 52\u00b77% (95% CI 31\u00b74 to 67\u00b74) 12-17 months after vaccination and 44\u00b77% (24\u00b78 to 59\u00b74) 24-36 months after vaccination. Although protection in the first 12-17 months after vaccination was similar for children aged 1-4 years and older individuals, the estimate of protection in children aged 1-4 years appeared to wane during the third year after vaccination (adjusted vaccine effectiveness 32\u00b79%, 95% CI -30\u00b77 to 65\u00b75), with CIs spanning the null.A single dose of Euvichol-Plus provided substantial protection against medically attended cholera for at least 36 months after vaccination in this cholera-endemic setting. Although the evidence provides support for similar levels of protection in young children and others in the short term, protection among children younger than 5 years might wane significantly during the third year after vaccination.In this matched case-control study, we recruited individuals with medically attended confirmed cholera in the two cholera treatment facilities in the city of Uvira. The control group consisted of age-matched, sex-matched, and neighbourhood-matched community individuals. We recruited across two distinct periods: Oct 14, 2021, to March 10, 2022 (12-17 months after vaccination), and Nov 21, 2022, to Oct 18, 2023 (24-36 months after vaccination). Study staff administered structured questionnaires to all participants to capture demographics, household conditions, potential confounding variables, and vaccination status. The odds of vaccination for the case and control groups were contrasted in conditional logistic regression models to estimate unadjusted and adjusted vaccine effectiveness.","1662":"Real-time epidemiological tracking of variants of concern (VOCs) can help limit the spread of more contagious forms of SARS-CoV-2, such as those containing the N501Y mutation. Typically, genetic sequencing is required to be able to track VOCs in real-time. However, sequencing can take time and may not be accessible in all laboratories. Genotyping by RT-ddPCR offers an alternative to rapidly detect VOCs through discrimination of specific alleles such as N501Y which is associated with increased transmissibility and virulence. Here we describe the first cases of the B.1.1.7 lineage of SARS-CoV-2 detected in Washington State by using a combination of RT-PCR, RT-ddPCR, and next-generation sequencing. We initially screened 1,035 samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 by our CDC-based laboratory developed assay using ThermoFisher's multiplex RT-PCR COVID-19 assay over four weeks from late December 2020 to early January 2021. S gene target failures (SGTF) were subsequently assayed by RT-ddPCR to confirm four mutations within the S gene associated with the B.1.1.7 lineage: a deletion at amino acid (AA) 69-70 (ACATGT), deletion at AA 145, (TTA), N501Y mutation (TAT), and S982A mutation (GCA). All four targets were detected in two specimens; follow-up sequencing revealed a total of 9 mutations in the S gene and phylogenetic clustering within the B.1.1.7 lineage. Next, we continued screening samples for SGTF detecting 23 additional B.1.1.7 variants by RT-ddPCR and confirmed by sequencing. As VOCs become increasingly prevalent, molecular diagnostic tools like RT-ddPCR can be utilized to quickly, accurately, and sensitively distinguish more contagious lineages of SARS-CoV-2.

However, it resulted in a substantial reduction in overall prevalence and infection intensity. Therefore, other than deworming for school children, interventions such as access to improved personal hygiene and environmental hygiene in school should be emphasized to interrupt transmission.School-based preventive mass chemotherapy has been a key component of Ethiopia's national plan for the control of soil-transmitted helminths. Without an impact evaluation on the impact of a deworming program on infection levels, it is unclear whether the deworming program warrants levels of environmental transmission of infection. This study aimed to determine the impact of annual preventive mass chemotherapy for soil-transmitted helminths among schoolchildren in an endemic area of Gurage zone, south-central Ethiopia.A repeated school-based quantitative prospective cross-sectional method was employed. Data were collected from study participants selected using systematic sampling with probability proportional to size at baseline and after annual treatment. Fresh stool samples were collected and processed using the Kato\u2500Katz technique at the Wolkite University parasitology laboratory. SPSS-21 was used for data management and analysis. Changes in parasitological variables after treatment were estimated. were 80.8%, 20.2%, and 96.7%, respectively.","1664":"Social factors have been shown to create differential burden of influenza across different geographic areas. We explored the relationship between potential aggregate-level social determinants and mortality during the 1918 influenza pandemic in Chicago using a historical dataset of 7,971 influenza and pneumonia deaths. Census tract-level social factors, including rates of illiteracy, homeownership, population, and unemployment, were assessed as predictors of pandemic mortality in Chicago. Poisson models fit with generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to estimate the association between social factors and the risk of influenza and pneumonia mortality. The Poisson model showed that influenza and pneumonia mortality increased, on average, by 32.2% for every 10% increase in illiteracy rate adjusted for population density, homeownership, unemployment, and age. We also found a significant association between transmissibility and population density, illiteracy, and unemployment but not homeownership. Lastly, analysis of the point locations of reported influenza and pneumonia deaths revealed fine-scale spatiotemporal clustering. This study shows that living in census tracts with higher illiteracy rates increased the risk of influenza and pneumonia mortality during the 1918 influenza pandemic in Chicago. Our observation that disparities in structural determinants of neighborhood-level health lead to disparities in influenza incidence in this pandemic suggests that disparities and their determinants should remain targets of research and control in future pandemics.","1665":"Utilizing a system dynamics (SD) modeling approach, the research team conducted a policy evaluation to determine the impact of GSLs on opioid use disorder (OUD) in Connecticut and evaluated the GSL based upon the following health outcomes: (1) emergency department (ED) visits for overdose, (2) behavioral changes of bystanders, and (3) overdose deaths.The simulation results indicate that the number of opioid-related deaths will continue to increase and that the GSL alone cannot effectively control the crisis. However, the SD approach that was used will allow policymakers to evaluate the effectiveness of the GSL over time using a simulation framework. This SD model demonstrates great potential by producing simulations that allow policymakers to assess multiple strategies for combating the opioid crisis and select optimal public health interventions.Although Good Samaritan laws (GSLs) have been widely adopted throughout the United States, their efficacy in individual states is often unknown. This paper offers an approach for assessing the impact of GSLs and insight for policy-makers and public health officials who wish to know whether they should expect to see outcomes from similar policy interventions.The simulation model suggests that Connecticut's GSL has not yet affected overdose deaths but has resulted in bystander behavioral changes, such as increased 911 calls for overdose. ED visits have increased as the number of opioid users has increased.","1666":"The power grid is going through significant changes with the introduction of renewable energy sources and the incorporation of smart grid technologies. These rapid advancements necessitate new models and analyses to keep up with the various emergent phenomena they induce. A major prerequisite of such work is the acquisition of well-constructed and accurate network datasets for the power grid infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a robust, scalable framework to synthesize power distribution networks that resemble their physical counterparts for a given region. We use openly available information about interdependent road and building infrastructures to construct the networks. In contrast to prior work based on network statistics, we incorporate engineering and economic constraints to create the networks. Additionally, we provide a framework to create ensembles of power distribution networks to generate multiple possible instances of the network for a given region. The comprehensive dataset consists of nodes with attributes, such as geocoordinates; type of node (residence, transformer, or substation); and edges with attributes, such as geometry, type of line (feeder lines, primary or secondary), and line parameters. For validation, we provide detailed comparisons of the generated networks with actual distribution networks. The generated datasets represent realistic test systems (as compared with standard test cases published by Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)) that can be used by network scientists to analyze complex events in power grids and to perform detailed sensitivity and statistical analyses over ensembles of networks.","1667":"In June of 2022, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Mpox Response wanted timely answers to important epidemiological questions which can now be answered more effectively through infectious disease modeling. Infectious disease models have shown to be valuable tools for decision making during outbreaks; however, model complexity often makes communicating the results and limitations of models to decision makers difficult. We performed nowcasting and forecasting for the 2022 mpox outbreak in the United States using the R package EpiNow2. We generated nowcasts\/forecasts at the national level, by Census region, and for jurisdictions reporting the greatest number of mpox cases. Modeling results were shared for situational awareness within the CDC Mpox Response and publicly on the CDC website. We retrospectively evaluated forecast predictions at four key phases (early, exponential growth, peak, and decline) during the outbreak using three metrics, the weighted interval score, mean absolute error, and prediction interval coverage. We compared the performance of EpiNow2 with a na\u00efve Bayesian generalized linear model (GLM). The EpiNow2 model had less probabilistic error than the GLM during every outbreak phase except for the early phase. We share our experiences with an existing tool for nowcasting\/forecasting and highlight areas of improvement for the development of future tools. We also reflect on lessons learned regarding data quality issues and adapting modeling results for different audiences.","1668":"The sensitivity of genotype-based diagnostics that predict antimicrobial susceptibility is limited by the extent to which they detect genes and alleles that lead to resistance. As novel resistance variants are expected to emerge, such sensitivity is expected to decline unless the new variants are detected and incorporated into the diagnostic. Here, we present a mathematical framework to define how many diagnostic failures may be expected under varying surveillance regimes and thus quantify the surveillance needed to maintain the sensitivity of genotype-based diagnostics.","1669":"Given a sequence of snapshots of flu propagating over a population network, can we find a segmentation when the patterns of the disease spread change, possibly due to interventions? In this paper, we study the problem of segmenting graph sequences with labeled nodes. Memes on the Twitter network, diseases over a contact network, movie-cascades over a social network, etc. are all graph sequences with labeled nodes. Most related work on this subject is on plain graphs and hence ignores the label dynamics. Others require fix parameters or feature engineering. We propose SNAPNETS, to automatically find segmentations of such graph sequences, with different characteristics of nodes of each label in adjacent segments. It satisfies all the desired properties (being parameter free, comprehensive and scalable) by leveraging a principled, multi-level, flexible framework which maps the problem to a path optimization problem over a weighted DAG. Also, we develop the parallel framework of SNAPNETS which speeds up its running time. Finally, we propose an extension of SNAPNETS to handle the dynamic graph structures and use it to detect anomalies (and events) in network sequences. Extensive experiments on several diverse real datasets show that it finds cut points matching ground-truth or meaningful external signals and detects anomalies outperforming non-trivial baselines. We also show that the segmentations are easily interpretable, and that SNAPNETS scales near-linearly with the size of the input. Finally, we show how to use SNAPNETS to detect anomaly in a sequence of dynamic networks.","1670":"For nearly half of origin-destination country pairs analysed, travel can be permitted in the absence of quarantine and testing. For the majority of pairs requiring controls, a short quarantine with testing could be as effective as a complete travel ban. The estimated travel quarantine durations are substantially shorter than those specified for traced contacts.EasyJet (JPT and APG), the Elihu endowment (JPT), the Burnett and Stender families' endowment (APG), the Notsew Orm Sands Foundation (JPT and APG), the National Institutes of Health (MCF), Canadian Institutes of Health Research (SMM) and Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada EIDM-MfPH (SMM).We present a generalised analytical framework and a specific case study of the epidemic situation on November 21, 2021, for application to 26 European countries. For most origin-destination country pairs, a three-day or shorter quarantine with RT-PCR or antigen testing on exit suffices. Adaptation to the European Union traffic-light risk stratification provided a simplified policy tool. Our analytical approach provides guidance for travel policy during all phases of pandemic diseases.Numerous countries have imposed strict travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to a large socioeconomic burden. The long quarantines that have been applied to contacts of cases may be excessive for travel policy.We developed an approach to evaluate imminent countrywide COVID-19 infections after 0-14-day quarantine and testing. We identified the minimum travel quarantine duration such that the infection rate within the destination country did not increase compared to a travel ban, defining this minimum quarantine as \"sufficient.\"","1671":"These results highlight the importance of clinical follow-up and behavioral interventions that support persistence of adjuvant endocrine therapy to prevent breast cancer recurrence. time-varying weights, which we calculated from multivariable logistic regression models, and included in regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) associating early discontinuation with recurrence.Over the study follow-up, 1,001 (22%) women discontinued endocrine therapy. We observed 202 (20%) recurrences among those who discontinued endocrine therapy, and 388 (11%) among those who completed the recommended treatment. The multivariable-adjusted estimated rate of recurrence was higher in women who discontinued endocrine therapy relative to those who completed their treatment (HR=1.67, 95% CI 1.25, 2.14).Premenopausal women diagnosed with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer are prescribed 5-10 years of endocrine therapy to prevent or delay recurrence. In this study, we evaluated the association between early discontinuation of endocrine therapy and breast cancer recurrence in a cohort of premenopausal women.","1672":"Newcastle disease (ND), caused by Newcastle disease virus (NDV), is a contagious disease that affects a variety of domestic and wild avian species. Though ND is vaccine-preventable, it is a persistent threat to poultry industry across the globe. The disease represents a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in chickens. To better understand the epidemiology of NDV among commercial and backyard chickens of Odisha, where chicken farming is being prioritized to assist with poverty alleviation, a cross-sectional study was conducted in two distinct seasons during 2018. Choanal swabs (n = 1361) from live birds (commercial layers, broilers, and backyard chicken) and tracheal tissues from dead birds (n = 10) were collected and tested by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the presence of matrix (M) and fusion (F) genes of NDV. Risk factors at the flock and individual bird levels (health status, ND vaccination status, geographical zone, management system, and housing) were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analyses. Of the 1371 samples tested, 160 were positive for M gene amplification indicating an overall apparent prevalence of 11.7% (95% CI 10.1-13.5%). Circulation of virulent NDV strains was also evident with apparent prevalence of 8.1% (13\/160; 95% CI: 4.8-13.4%). In addition, commercial birds had significantly higher odds (75%) of being infected with NDV as compared to backyard poultry (p = 0.01). This study helps fill a knowledge gap in the prevalence and distribution of NDV in apparently healthy birds in eastern India, and provides a framework for future longitudinal research of NDV risk and mitigation in targeted geographies-a step forward for effective control of ND in Odisha.","1673":"The Ross-Macdonald model has exerted enormous influence over the study of malaria transmission dynamics and control, but it lacked features to describe parasite dispersal, travel, and other important aspects of heterogeneous transmission. Here, we present a patch-based differential equation modeling framework that extends the Ross-Macdonald model with sufficient skill and complexity to support planning, monitoring and evaluation for Plasmodium falciparum malaria control. We designed a generic interface for building structured, spatial models of malaria transmission based on a new algorithm for mosquito blood feeding. We developed new algorithms to simulate adult mosquito demography, dispersal, and egg laying in response to resource availability. The core dynamical components describing mosquito ecology and malaria transmission were decomposed, redesigned and reassembled into a modular framework. Structural elements in the framework-human population strata, patches, and aquatic habitats-interact through a flexible design that facilitates construction of ensembles of models with scalable complexity to support robust analytics for malaria policy and adaptive malaria control. We propose updated definitions for the human biting rate and entomological inoculation rates. We present new formulas to describe parasite dispersal and spatial dynamics under steady state conditions, including the human biting rates, parasite dispersal, the \"vectorial capacity matrix,\" a human transmitting capacity distribution matrix, and threshold conditions. An [Formula: see text] package that implements the framework, solves the differential equations, and computes spatial metrics for models developed in this framework has been developed. Development of the model and metrics have focused on malaria, but since the framework is modular, the same ideas and software can be applied to other mosquito-borne pathogen systems.","1674":" is archived at 1.8 V with high OER selectivity and long-term stability for over 200 h, which surpasses the benchmarking platinum-group-metals-free electrolyzers.","1675":"The prevalence of anxiety, depression, or OCD moved from 47.1, to 57.2, to 42.2% across the three timepoints during the study. By endline of the study, in April 2021, non-white children were at higher risk for depression and OCD. Risk for anxiety, depression, and OCD was associated with students who lost a family member due to COVID-19 and who were identified as at-risk in previous timepoints. Rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seropositivity were low and not statistically associated with assessed outcomes.A longitudinal study with three cross-sectional timepoints [April 2020 (n = 273), October 2020 (n = 180), and April 2021 (n = 116)] was conducted at a K-12 public school in Florida. Infection and sero-positivity for SARS-CoV-2 was determined by molecular and serologic approaches. Adjusted odds ratios using mixed effect logistic regression models for symptom-derived indicators of anxiety, depression, and OCD in children in April 2021 are presented; past infection and seropositivity were included in the models.In situations like the COVID-19 pandemic, targeted mental health interventions and screenings are needed in children and adolescents, especially among minority children.To identify risk factors associated with symptoms of anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) among children during the 1st year of the COVID-19 pandemic.","1676":"Presence of SARS-CoV-2 was monitored in nasopharyngeal samples from young children aged 6-30 months attending day-care centres (DCCs) in Belgium from May 2020-February 2022. SARS-CoV-2 carriage among DCC children was only detected from November 2021, after emergence of Delta and Omicron variants, in 9 of the 42 DCCs screened. In only one DCC, two children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the same sampling time point, suggesting limited transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Belgian DCCs among young children during the studied period.","1677":"Similar to managing software packages, managing the ontology life cycle involves multiple complex workflows such as preparing releases, continuous quality control checking and dependency management. To manage these processes, a diverse set of tools is required, from command-line utilities to powerful ontology-engineering environmentsr. Particularly in the biomedical domain, which has developed a set of highly diverse yet inter-dependent ontologies, standardizing release practices and metadata and establishing shared quality standards are crucial to enable interoperability. The Ontology Development Kit (ODK) provides a set of standardized, customizable and automatically executable workflows, and packages all required tooling in a single Docker image.

To reduce disease transmission, policymakers can enforce reduced crowding and mandate wearing of masks. emph{Cohorting} -- forming groups of travelers that always travel together, is an additional policy to reduce disease transmission on textit{locals} without severe restrictions. Cohorting allows us to: ($i$) form traveler bubbles, thereby decreasing the number of distinct interactions over time; ($ii$) potentially quarantine an entire cohort if a single case is detected, making contact tracing more efficient, and ($iii$) target cohorts for testing and early detection of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic cases. Studying impact of cohorts using compartmental models is challenging because of the ensuing representational complexity. Agent-based models provide a natural way to represent cohorts along with the representation of the cohort members with the larger social network. This paper describes a novel multi-scale agent-based model to study the impact of cohorting strategies on COVID-19 dynamics in Mumbai. We achieve this by modeling the Mumbai urban region using a detailed agent-based model comprising of 12.4 million agents. Individual cohorts and their inter-cohort interactions as they travel on locals are modeled using local mean field approximations. The resulting multi-scale model in conjunction with a detailed disease transmission and intervention simulator is used to assess various cohorting strategies. The results provide a quantitative trade-off between cohort size and its impact on disease dynamics and well being. The results show that cohorts can provide significant benefit in terms of reduced transmission without significantly impacting ridership and or economic & social activity.","1679":"Compartmental models are commonly used to describe the spread of infectious diseases by estimating the probabilities of transitions between important disease states. A significant challenge in fitting Bayesian compartmental models lies in the need to estimate the duration of the infectious period, based on limited data providing only symptom onset date or another proxy for the start of infectiousness. Commonly, the exponential distribution is used to describe the infectious duration, an overly simplistic approach, which is not biologically plausible. More flexible distributions can be used, but parameter identifiability and computational cost can worsen for moderately sized or large epidemics. In this article, we present a novel approach, which considers a curve of transmissibility over a fixed infectious duration. The incorporation of infectious duration-dependent (IDD) transmissibility, which decays to zero during the infectious period, is biologically reasonable for many viral infections and fixing the length of the infectious period eases computational complexity in model fitting. Through simulation, we evaluate different functional forms of IDD transmissibility curves and show that the proposed approach offers improved estimation of the time-varying reproductive number. We illustrate the benefit of our approach through a new analysis of the 1995 outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease in the Democratic Republic of the\u00a0Congo.","1680":"The female reproductive organs, specifically the vagina and cervix, are composed of various cellular components and a unique extracellular matrix (ECM). Smooth muscle cells exhibit a contractile function within the vaginal and cervical walls. Depending on the biochemical environment and the mechanical distension of the organ walls, the smooth muscle cells alter the contractile conditions. The contribution of the smooth muscle cells under baseline physiological conditions is classified as a basal tone. More specifically, a basal tone is the baseline partial constriction of smooth muscle cells in the absence of hormonal and neural stimulation. Furthermore, the ECM provides structural support for the organ walls and functions as a reservoir for biochemical cues. These biochemical cues are vital to various organ functions, such as inciting growth and maintaining homeostasis. The ECM of each organ is composed primarily of collagen fibers (mostly collagen types I, III, and V), elastic fibers, and glycosaminoglycans\/proteoglycans. The composition and organization of the ECM dictate the mechanical properties of each organ. A change in ECM composition may lead to the development of reproductive pathologies, such as pelvic organ prolapse or premature cervical remodeling. Furthermore, changes in ECM microstructure and stiffness may alter smooth muscle cell activity and phenotype, thus resulting in the loss of the contractile force. In this work, the reported protocols are used to assess the basal tone and passive mechanical properties of the nonpregnant murine vagina and cervix at 4-6 months of age in estrus. The organs were mounted in a commercially available pressure myograph and both pressure-diameter and force-length tests were performed. Sample data and data analysis techniques for the mechanical characterization of the reproductive organs are included. Such information may be useful for constructing mathematical models and rationally designing therapeutic interventions for women's health pathologies.","1681":" diversity and its evolution using genomics will further the understanding of the epidemiology of spread of this disease-causing protozoan.","1682":"The interaction of several sociocultural and environmental factors during an epidemic crisis leads to behavioral responses that consequently make the crisis control a complex problem.The system dynamics approach has been adopted to study the\u00a0relationships between spread of disease, public attention, situational awareness, and community's response to the Ebola epidemic.The best fit to historical data are achieved when behavioral factors specific to West Africa like studying the Situational Awareness and Public Attention are included in the model. However, by ignoring the sociocultural factors, the model is not able to represent the reality; therefore, in the case of any epidemics, it is necessary that all the parties and community members find the most significant behavioral factors that can curb the epidemic.In developing different simulation models to capture the trend of death and incidence data from the World Health Organization for the Ebola outbreak, the final model has the best fit to the historical trends. Results demonstrate that the increase of quarantining rate over time due to increase in situational awareness and performing safe burials had a significant impact on the control of epidemic. However, public attention did not play a significant role.","1683":": New effective strategies are needed to reduce the high burden of musculoskeletal outcomes among farmers and agricultural workers.","1684":"A novel coronavirus designated as 2019-nCoV first appeared in Wuhan, China in late December 2019. Dozens of people died in China, and thousands of people infected as 2019-nCoV continues to spread around the world.

Nonetheless, changes in the system-level dynamics of neuronal networks with damaged synapses can be detected using techniques that do not require high spatial resolution. This paper investigates how the structure\/topology of neuronal networks influences their dynamics when they suffer from synaptic loss. We study different neuronal network structures\/topologies by specifying their degree distributions. The modes of the degree distribution can be used to construct networks that consist of rich clubs and resemble small world networks, as well. We define two dynamical metrics to compare the activity of networks with different structures: persistent activity (namely, the self-sustained activity of the network upon removal of the initial stimulus) and quality of activity (namely, percentage of neurons that participate in the persistent activity of the network). Our results show that synaptic loss affects the persistent activity of networks with bimodal degree distributions less than it affects random networks. The robustness of neuronal networks enhances when the distance between the modes of the degree distribution increases, suggesting that the rich clubs of networks with distinct modes keep the whole network active. In addition, a tradeoff is observed between the quality of activity and the persistent activity. For a range of distributions, both of these dynamical metrics are considerably high for networks with bimodal degree distribution compared to random networks. We also propose three different scenarios of synaptic impairment, which may correspond to different pathological or biological conditions. Regardless of the network structure\/topology, results demonstrate that synaptic loss has more severe effects on the activity of the network when impairments are correlated with the activity of the neurons.","1686":"Both approaches revealed two distinct phases of COVID-19 spread by the end of March 2020. In the first phase, COVID-19 largely circulated in China during mid- to late January, 2020, and was interrupted by containment measures in China. In the second and predominant phase extending from late February to mid-March, unrestricted movements between countries outside of China facilitated intercontinental spread, with Europe as a major source. Phylogenetic analyses also revealed that the dominant strains circulating in the United States of America were introduced from Europe. However, stringent restrictions on international travel across the world since late March have substantially reduced intercontinental transmission.We performed two independent analyses, travel network-based epidemiological modelling and Bayesian phylogeographic inference, to investigate the intercontinental spread of COVID-19.The COVID-19 pandemic has posed an ongoing global crisis, but how the virus spread across the world remains poorly understood. This is of vital importance for informing current and future pandemic response strategies.Our analyses highlight that heterogeneities in international travel have shaped the spatiotemporal characteristics of the pandemic. Unrestricted travel caused a large number of COVID-19 exportations from Europe to other continents between late February and mid-March, which facilitated the COVID-19 pandemic. Targeted restrictions on international travel from countries with widespread community transmission, together with improved capacity in testing, genetic sequencing and contact tracing, can inform timely strategies for mitigating and containing COVID-19 outbreaks post-lockdown.","1687":"Wildlife epidemiological outcomes can depend strongly on the composition of an ecological community, particularly when multiple host species are affected by the same pathogen. However, the relationship between host species richness and disease risk can vary with community context and with the degree of spillover transmission that occurs among co-occurring host species. We examined the degree to which host species composition influences infection by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a widespread fungal pathogen associated with amphibian population declines around the world, and whether transmission occurs from one highly susceptible host species to other co-occurring host species. By manipulating larval assemblages of three sympatric amphibian species in the laboratory, we characterized the relationship between host species richness and infection severity, whether infection mediates growth and survivorship differently across various combinations of host species, and whether Bd is transmitted from experimentally inoculated tadpoles to uninfected tadpoles. We found evidence of a dilution effect where Bd infection severity was dramatically reduced in the most susceptible of the three host species (Anaxyrus boreas). Infection also mediated survival and growth of all three host species such that the presence of multiple host species had both positive (e.g., infection reduction) and negative (e.g., mortality) effects on focal species. However, we found no evidence that Bd infection is transmitted by this species. While these results demonstrate that host species richness as well as species identity underpin infection dynamics in this system, dilution is not the product of reduced transmission via fewer infectious individuals of a susceptible host species. We discuss various mechanisms, including encounter reduction and antagonistic interactions such as competition and opportunistic cannibalism that may act in concert to mediate patterns of infection severity, growth, and mortality observed in multihost communities. ","1688":"We collected 112 longitudinal samples and recorded pH, temperature, river depth, precipitation, and dissolved oxygen. We also performed a series of three experiments designed to provide insight into Leptospira presence in the soil. In the first soil experiment, we characterized prevalence and co-occurrence of Leptospira with other bacterial taxa in the soil at dispersed sites along the rivers (n\u00a0=\u200964). In the second soil experiment, we collected 24 river samples and 48 soil samples at three points along eight transects to compare the likelihood of finding Leptospira in the river and on the shore at different distances from the river. In a third experiment, we tested whether Leptospira presence is associated with soil moisture by collecting 25 soil samples from two different sites. In our river experiment, we found pathogenic Leptospira in only 4 (3.7%) of samples. In contrast, pathogenic Leptospira species were found in 22% of shore soil at dispersed sites, 16.7% of soil samples (compared to 4.2% of river samples) in the transects, and 40% of soil samples to test for associations with soil moisture.Leptospira are shed into the environment via urine of infected animals. Rivers are thought to be an important risk factor for transmission to humans, though much is unknown about the types of environment or characteristics that favor survival. To address this, we screened for Leptospira DNA in two rivers in rural Ecuador where Leptospirosis is endemic.Our data are limited to two sites in a highly endemic area, but the scarcity of Leptospira DNA in the river is not consistent with the widespread contention of the importance of river water for leptospirosis transmission. While Leptospira may be shed directly into the river, onto the shores, or washed into the river from more remote sites, massive dilution and limited persistence in rivers may reduce the environmental load and therefore, the epidemiological significance of such sources. It is also possible that transmission may occur more frequently on shores where people are liable to be barefoot. Molecular studies that further explore the role of rivers and water bodies in the epidemiology of leptospirosis are needed.","1689":"We adapted a previously published model of HIV transmission and evolution (EvoNetHIV), parameterized here for men who have sex with men (MSM). We conducted a series of simulation experiments that vary seven behavioral or clinical parameters that affect exposure risk as people age. We conducted regressions to determine the mean increase in SPVL per 10-year increase in seroconversion age, with and without source SPVL in the model.Set-point viral load (SPVL) correlates with the age at which people acquire HIV. Although immunosenescence may seem like a parsimonious explanation for this, it does not easily explain the observation that the relationship between age and SPVL attenuates when accounting for source partner SPVL. Here we propose an alternative explanation that encompasses this latter finding: that decreasing risk of acquisition with older age generates a selection bottleneck that selects for more virulent strains with age.All runs generated significant relationships between seroconversion age and SPVL when not including source SPVL. All saw attenuated relationships, most to near 0, with source SPVL included. Four of our behavioral measures (relational duration, age-related homophily, coital frequency, and mean age at relationship formation) had clear effects on this relationship, all in the hypothesized direction. Combining multiple forms of behavioral heterogeneity yielded an increase of 0.056 log10 copies\/mL SPVL per 10-year increase in seroconversion age, nearly as large as that seen in two empirical studies of age-SPVL correlations in MSM.The higher virulence of HIV among those infected later in life may be partly explained by a combination of selective bottlenecks and behavioral heterogeneity by age. Variation in the strength of this effect across populations may be in part due to different behavioral, epidemiological and clinical conditions, and not require assumptions about differences in patterns of immunosenescence among populations.","1690":"Individual variation in susceptibility and exposure is subject to selection by natural infection, accelerating the acquisition of immunity, and reducing herd immunity thresholds and epidemic final sizes. This is a manifestation of a wider population phenomenon known as \"frailty variation\". Despite theoretical understanding, public health policies continue to be guided by mathematical models that leave out considerable variation and as a result inflate projected disease burdens and overestimate the impact of interventions. Here we focus on trajectories of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in England and Scotland until November 2021. We fit models to series of daily deaths and infer relevant epidemiological parameters, including coefficients of variation and effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions which we find in agreement with independent empirical estimates based on contact surveys. Our estimates are robust to whether the analysed data series encompass one or two pandemic waves and enable projections compatible with subsequent dynamics. We conclude that vaccination programmes may have contributed modestly to the acquisition of herd immunity in populations with high levels of pre-existing naturally acquired immunity, while being critical to protect vulnerable individuals from severe outcomes as the virus becomes endemic.","1691":"Previous studies have evaluated the treatment efficacy of patients with mild to moderate scrub typhus (ST), however, the efficacy of treating severe ST with different antibiotics remained obscure.A retrospective study was performed to include severe ST patients in China. The treatment efficacy of doxycycline, azithromycin, or chloramphenicol were compared by using treatment failure and the time to defervescence as primary outcomes.In total, 876 severe ST patients who initially received doxycycline, azithromycin, or chloramphenicol treatment were recruited. Treatment failure rate was not significantly different between those receiving doxycycline and azithromycin therapy (6.0% vs 11.4%, p=0.109). However, a higher rate of treatment failure was observed for chloramphenicol than doxycycline therapy (14.6% vs 6.0%, p=0.004). No significant difference was observed for the time to defervescence in those receiving doxycycline, azithromycin, and chloramphenicol treatment respectively. Further subgroup analysis revealed a higher risk of treatment failure related to chloramphenicol than doxycycline in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), pneumonia, and shock; a higher risk of treatment failure related to azithromycin than doxycycline in patients with meningitis. Significant correlation between azithromycin resistance and meningitis (p=0.009), between chloramphenicol resistance and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (p<0.001) were obsevered by cramer's V correlation coefficients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed significant association between time to defervescence and presence of ARDS, shock, myocarditis, meningitis, and AKI.Significant therapy effect of azithromycin and doxycycline was observed for severe patients, by contrast, a lower therapy effect was observed for chloramphenicol in treating severe patients.","1692":"Newly available datasets present exciting opportunities to investigate how human population movement contributes to the spread of infectious diseases across large geographical distances. It is now possible to construct realistic models of infectious disease dynamics for the purposes of understanding global-scale epidemics. Nevertheless, a remaining unanswered question is how best to leverage the new data to parameterize models of movement, and whether one's choice of movement model impacts modeled disease outcomes. We adapt three well-studied models of infectious disease dynamics, the susceptible-infected-recovered model, the susceptible-infected-susceptible model, and the Ross-Macdonald model, to incorporate either of two candidate movement models. We describe the effect that the choice of movement model has on each disease model's results, finding that in all cases, there are parameter regimes where choosing one movement model instead of another has a profound impact on epidemiological outcomes. We further demonstrate the importance of choosing an appropriate movement model using the applied case of malaria transmission and importation on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, finding that one model produces intelligible predictions of R 0, whereas the other produces nonsensical results.","1693":"As malaria is being pushed back on many frontiers and global case numbers are declining, accurate measurement and prediction of transmission becomes increasingly difficult. Low transmission settings are characterised by high levels of spatial heterogeneity, which stands in stark contrast to the widely used assumption of spatially homogeneous transmission used in mathematical transmission models for malaria. In the present study an individual-based mathematical malaria transmission model that incorporates multiple parasite clones, variable human exposure and duration of infection, limited mosquito flight distance and most importantly geographically heterogeneous human and mosquito population densities was used to illustrate the differences between homogeneous and heterogeneous transmission assumptions when aiming to predict surrogate indicators of transmission intensity such as population parasite prevalence or multiplicity of infection (MOI). In traditionally highly malaria endemic regions where most of the population harbours malaria parasites, humans are often infected with multiple parasite clones. However, studies have shown also in areas with low overall parasite prevalence, infection with multiple parasite clones is a common occurrence. Mathematical models assuming homogeneous transmission between humans and mosquitoes cannot explain these observations. Heterogeneity of transmission can arise from many factors including acquired immunity, body size and occupational exposure. In this study, we show that spatial heterogeneity has a profound effect on predictions of MOI and parasite prevalence. We illustrate, that models assuming homogeneous transmission underestimate average MOI in low transmission settings when compared to field data and that spatially heterogeneous models predict stable transmission at much lower overall parasite prevalence. Therefore it is very important that models used to guide malaria surveillance and control strategies in low transmission and elimination settings take into account the spatial features of the specific target area, including human and mosquito vector distribution.","1694":"Rabies causes more than 24 000 human deaths annually in Sub-Saharan Africa. The World Health Organization recommends annual canine vaccination campaigns with at least 70% coverage to control the disease. While previous studies have considered optimal coverage of animal rabies vaccination, variation in the frequency of vaccination campaigns has not been explored. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of rabies canine vaccination campaigns at varying coverage and frequency, we parametrized a rabies virus transmission model to two districts of northwest Tanzania, Ngorongoro (pastoral) and Serengeti (agro-pastoral). We found that optimal vaccination strategies were every 2 years, at 80% coverage in Ngorongoro and annually at 70% coverage in Serengeti. We further found that the optimality of these strategies was sensitive to the rate of rabies reintroduction from outside the district. Specifically, if a geographically coordinated campaign could reduce reintroduction, vaccination campaigns every 2 years could effectively manage rabies in both districts. Thus, coordinated campaigns may provide monetary savings in addition to public health benefits. Our results indicate that frequency and coverage of canine vaccination campaigns should be evaluated simultaneously and tailored to local canine ecology as well as to the risk of disease reintroduction from surrounding regions.","1695":"While abrupt regime shifts between different metastable states have occurred in natural systems from many areas including ecology, biology, and climate, evidence for this phenomenon in transportation systems has been rarely observed so far. This limitation might be rooted in the fact that we lack methods to identify and analyze possible multiple states that could emerge at scales of the entire traffic network. Here, using percolation approaches, we observe such a metastable regime in traffic systems. In particular, we find multiple metastable network states, corresponding to varying levels of traffic performance, which recur over different days. Based on high-resolution global positioning system (GPS) datasets of urban traffic in the megacities of Beijing and Shanghai (each with over 50,000 road segments), we find evidence supporting the existence of tipping points separating three regimes: a global functional regime and a metastable hysteresis-like regime, followed by a global collapsed regime. We can determine the intrinsic critical points where the metastable hysteresis-like regime begins and ends and show that these critical points are very similar across different days. Our findings provide a better understanding of traffic resilience patterns and could be useful for designing early warning signals for traffic resilience management and, potentially, other complex systems.","1696":"To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of surgical treatment pathways for apical prolapse.Over 5 years, compared with expectant management, all surgical treatment pathways cost less than the willingness-to-pay threshold of US $50,000 per quality adjusted life-years. However, among surgical treatments, all but 2 pathways were dominated. Of the remaining 2, laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy followed by vaginal repair for apical recurrence was not cost-effective compared with the vaginal-only approach (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER], >$500,000). Over 10 years, all but the same 2 pathways were dominated. However, starting with the laparoscopic approach in this case was more cost-effective with an ICER of US $6,176. If the laparoscopic approach was not available, starting with the robotic approach similarly became more cost-effective at 10 years (ICER, US $35,479).We constructed a stochastic Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of vaginal apical suspension, laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy, and robotic sacrocolpopexy. We modeled over 5 and 10 years, with 9 pathways accounting for up to 2 separate surgical repairs, recurrence of symptomatic apical prolapse, reoperation, and complications, including mesh excision. We calculated costs from the health care system's perspective.All minimally invasive surgical approaches for apical prolapse repair are cost-effective when compared with expectant management. Among surgical treatments, the vaginal-only approach is the only cost-effective option over 5 years. However, over a longer period, starting with a laparoscopic (or robotic) approach becomes cost-effective. These results help inform discussions regarding the surgical approach for prolapse.","1697":"HIV risk perception plays a crucial role in the uptake of preventive strategies. We investigated how risk perception and its determinants changed between 1999 and 2018 in an open, prospective cohort of 1323 HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM). Risk perception, defined as the perceived likelihood of acquiring HIV in the past 6\u00a0months, changed over time: being relatively lower in 2008-2011, higher in 2012-2016, and again lower in 2017-2018. Irrespective of calendar year, condomless anal intercourse (AI) with casual partners and high numbers of partners were associated with higher risk perception. In 2017-2018, condomless receptive AI with a partner living with HIV was no longer associated with risk perception, while PrEP use and condomless AI with a steady partner were associated with lower risk perception. We showed that risk perception has fluctuated among MSM in the past 20\u00a0years. The Undetectable equals Untransmittable statement and PrEP coincided with lower perceived risk.","1698":" process that transcends the substrate in which it occurs. Indeed, many researchers in the field of digital evolution can provide examples of how their evolving algorithms and organisms have creatively subverted their expectations or intentions, exposed unrecognized bugs in their code, produced unexpectedly adaptations, or engaged in behaviors and outcomes, uncannily convergent with ones found in nature. Such stories routinely reveal surprise and creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into the standard scientific narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles to be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. Bugs are fixed, experiments are refocused, and one-off surprises are collapsed into a single data point. The stories themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but that mode of information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and outright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only among practitioners means that many natural scientists do not realize how interesting and lifelike digital organisms are and how natural their evolution can be. To our knowledge, no collection of such anecdotes has been published before. This article is the crowd-sourced product of researchers in the fields of artificial life and evolutionary computation who have provided first-hand accounts of such cases. It thus serves as a written, fact-checked collection of scientifically important and even entertaining stories. In doing so we also present here substantial evidence that the existence and importance of evolutionary surprises extends beyond the natural world, and may indeed be a universal property of all complex evolving systems.","1699":"Multidrug resistance is a serious problem raising the specter of infections for which there is no treatment. One of the most important tools in combating multidrug resistance is large scale monitoring programs, because they track resistance over large geographic areas and time scales. This large scope, however, can also introduce variability into the data. The primary monitoring program in the United States is the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS). This study examines the variability of a previously identified resistance pattern in Escherichia coli among ampicillin, gentamicin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline using samples isolated from chicken during the years 2004 to 2006 and 2008 to 2012. 2007 is excluded because sulfisozaxole resistance was not measured at slaughter that year. To assess variability in this resistance pattern susceptibility\/resistance contingency tables were constructed for each of the 15 combinations of the 4 drugs for each of the years. For each table, variability across the years was assessed at the full table multinomial level as a measure of general variability of the resistance pattern and at the level of the highest order interaction term in a log-linear model of the table as a measure of variability in that particular component of the resistance pattern. A power analysis using the traditional asymptotic normal approximation and one using a Dirichlet-multinomial simulation were carried out to determine the effect of variation on ability to detect nonzero highest order loglinear model terms and the validity of the normal approximation in carrying out such tests. All tables exhibit overdispersion at the multinomial level and in their highest order model parameters. The normal approximation performs well for large sample sizes, low levels of dispersion, and small log-linear model parameters. The approximation breaks down as dispersion or the log linear model parameter grows or sample size shrinks. Taken together these analyses indicate that the level of variability in the NARMS dataset makes it difficult to detect multidrug resistance patterns at the current level of sample collection. In order to better control this dispersion NARMS could collect more variables on each of the samples.","1700":"Using a large nationwide cohort, our study suggests that long-term exposure to PM2.5, NO2, and O3 may independently increase the risk of stroke among the US elderly, among which traffic-related air pollution plays a particularly crucial role.Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability for Americans, and growing evidence suggests that air pollution may play an important role. To facilitate pollution control efforts, the National Academy of Sciences and the World Health Organization have prioritized determining which air pollutants are most toxic. However, evidence is limited for the simultaneous effects of multiple air pollutants on stroke.We constructed a nationwide population-based cohort study, using the Medicare Chronic Conditions Warehouse (2000-2017) and high-resolution air pollution data, to investigate the impact of long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5, NO2, and ground-level O3 on incident stroke. Hazard ratios (HR) for stroke incidence were estimated using single-, bi-, and tri-pollutant Cox proportional hazards models. We identified ~2.2 million incident stroke cases among 17,443,900 fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries. Per interquartile range (IQR) increase in the annual average PM2.5 (3.7 \u03bcg\/m3), NO2 (12.4 ppb), and warm-season O3 (6.5 ppb) one-year prior to diagnosis, the HRs were 1.022 (95% CI: 1.017-1.028), 1.060 (95% CI: 1.054-1.065), and 1.021 (95% CI: 1.017-1.024), respectively, from the tri-pollutant model. There was strong evidence of linearity in concentration-response relationships for all three air pollutants in single-pollutant models. This linear relationship remained robust for NO2 and O3 in tri-pollutant models while the effect of PM2.5 attenuated at the lower end of concentrations.","1701":"The advent of the digital era provided a fertile ground for the development of virtual societies, complex systems influencing real-world dynamics. Understanding online human behavior and its relevance beyond the digital boundaries is still an open challenge. Here we show that online social interactions during a massive voting event can be used to build an accurate map of real-world political parties and electoral ranks for Italian elections in 2018. We provide evidence that information flow and collective attention are often driven by a special class of highly influential users, that we name \"augmented humans\", who exploit thousands of automated agents, also known as bots, for enhancing their online influence. We show that augmented humans generate deep information cascades, to the same extent of news media and other broadcasters, while they uniformly infiltrate across the full range of identified groups. Digital augmentation represents the cyber-physical counterpart of the human desire to acquire power within social systems.","1702":"Focusing specifically on the gender-climate-health nexus, this Personal View builds on existing feminist works and analyses to discuss why intersectional approaches to climate policy and inclusive representation in climate decision making are crucial for achieving just and equitable solutions to address the impacts of climate change on human health and societies. This Personal View highlights how women, girls, and gender-diverse people often face disproportionate climate-related health impacts, particularly those who experience compounding and overlapping vulnerabilities due to current and former systems of oppression. We summarise the insufficient meaningful inclusion of gender, health, and their intersection in international climate governance. Despite the tendency to conflate gender equality with number-based representation, climate governance under the UNFCCC (1995-2023) remains dominated by men, with several countries projected to take over a decade to achieve gender parity in their Party delegations. Advancing gender-responsiveness in climate policy and implementation and promoting equitable participation in climate governance will not only improve the inclusivity and effectiveness of national strategies, but will also build more resilient, equitable, and healthier societies.","1703":"High-quality, representative serological surveys allow direct estimates of immunity profiles to inform vaccination strategies but can be costly and logistically challenging. Leveraging residual serum samples is one way to increase their feasibility. We subsampled 9854 residual sera from a 2016 national HIV survey in Zambia and tested these specimens for anti-measles and anti-rubella virus IgG antibodies using indirect enzyme immunoassays. We demonstrate innovative methods for sampling residual sera and analyzing seroprevalence data, as well as the value of seroprevalence estimates to understand and control measles and rubella. National measles and rubella seroprevalence for individuals younger than 50\u00a0years was 82.8% (95% CI 81.6, 83.9%) and 74.9% (95% CI 73.7, 76.0%), respectively. Despite a successful childhood vaccination program, measles immunity gaps persisted across age groups and districts, indicating the need for additional activities to complement routine immunization. Prior to vaccine introduction, we estimated a rubella burden of 96 congenital rubella syndrome cases per 100,000 live births. Residual samples from large-scale surveys can reduce the cost and challenges of conducting serosurveys, and multiple pathogens can be tested. Procedures to access quality specimens, ensure ethical approvals, and link sociodemographic data can improve the timeliness and value of results.","1704":"We used a retrospective observational design analyzing routine data from electronic clinical records from 6 of 10 ambulance services in the United Kingdom during 2019. Descriptive statistics, including numbers and frequencies, were used to illustrate characteristics of incidents and patients that the community first responders attended first in both rural and urban areas.The data included 4.5 million incidents during 1 year. The community first responders first attended a higher proportion of calls in rural areas compared with those in urban areas (3.90% versus 1.48 %). In rural areas, the community first responders also first attended a higher percentage of the most urgent call categories, 1 and 2. The community first responders first attended more than 9% of the total number of category 1 calls and almost 5% of category 2 calls. The community first responders also attended a higher percentage of the total number of cardiorespiratory and neurological\/endocrine conditions. They first attended 6.5% of the total number of neurological\/endocrine conditions and 5.9% of the total number of cardiorespiratory conditions. Regarding arrival times in rural areas, the community first responders attended higher percentages (more than 6%) of the total number of calls that had arrival times of less than 7 minutes or more than 60 minutes.In the United Kingdom, community first responders contribute to the delivery of emergency medical services, particularly in rural areas and especially for more urgent calls. The work of community first responders has expanded from their original purpose-to attend to out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. The future development of community first responders' schemes should prioritize training for a range of conditions, and further research is needed to explore the contribution and potential future role of the community first responders from the perspective of service users, community first responders' schemes, ambulance services, and commissioners.We aimed to investigate community first responders' contribution to emergency care provision in terms of number, rate, type, and location of calls and characteristics of patients attended.","1705":"In almost all animals, the transfer of information from the brain to the motor circuitry is facilitated by a relatively small number of neurons, leading to a constraint on the amount of information that can be transmitted. Our knowledge of how animals encode information through this pathway, and the consequences of this encoding, however, is limited. In this study, we use a simple feed-forward neural network to investigate the consequences of having such a bottleneck and identify aspects of the network architecture that enable robust information transfer. We are able to explain some recently observed properties of descending neurons-that they exhibit a modular pattern of connectivity and that their excitation leads to consistent alterations in behavior that are often dependent upon the desired behavioral state of the animal. Our model predicts that in the presence of an information bottleneck, such a modular structure is needed to increase the efficiency of the network and to make it more robust to perturbations. However, it does so at the cost of an increase in state-dependent effects. Despite its simplicity, our model is able to provide intuition for the trade-offs faced by the nervous system in the presence of an information processing constraint and makes predictions for future experiments.","1706":"We developed mathematical models to analyze a large dengue virus (DENV) epidemic in Reunion Island in 2018-2019. Our models captured major drivers of uncertainty including the complex relationship between climate and DENV transmission, temperature trends, and underreporting. Early assessment correctly concluded that persistence of DENV transmission during the austral winter 2018 was likely and that the second epidemic wave would be larger than the first one. From November 2018, the detection probability was estimated at 10%-20% and, for this range of values, our projections were found to be remarkably accurate. Overall, we estimated that 8% and 18% of the population were infected during the first and second wave, respectively. Out of the 3 models considered, the best-fitting one was calibrated to laboratory entomological data, and accounted for temperature but not precipitation. This study showcases the contribution of modeling to strengthen risk assessments and planning of national and local authorities.","1707":"Major options for second-line therapy in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) include splenectomy, rituximab, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TRAs). The American Society of Hematology guidelines recommend rituximab over splenectomy, TRAs over rituximab, and splenectomy or TRAs while noting a lack of evidence on the cost-effectiveness of these therapies. Using prospective, observational, and meta-analytic data, we performed the first cost-effectiveness analysis of second-line therapies in chronic ITP, from the perspective of the U.S. health system. Over a 20-year time-horizon, our six-strategy Markov model shows that a strategy incorporating early splenectomy, an approach at odds with current guidelines and clinical practice, is the cost-effective strategy. All four strategies utilizing TRAs in the first or second position cost over $1 million per quality-adjusted life-year, as compared to strategies involving early use of splenectomy and rituximab. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, early use of splenectomy and rituximab in either order was favored in 100% of 10\u00a0000 iterations. The annual cost of TRAs would have to decrease over 80% to begin to become cost-effective in any early TRA strategy. Our data indicate that effectiveness of early TRA and late TRA strategies is similar with the cost significantly greater with early TRA strategies. Contrary to current practice trends and guidelines, early use of splenectomy and rituximab, rather than TRAs, constitutes cost-effective treatment in adults with chronic ITP.","1708":"For 360 children from the South African Drakenstein Child Health Study, we created trajectories of Child Behavior Checklist scores (24, 42, 60 months) using latent class linear mixed effects models. Indoor air pollutants and psychosocial factors were measured during pregnancy (2nd trimester). After adjusting for confounding, single-exposure effects (per natural log-1 unit increase) were assessed using polytomous logistic regression models; joint effects using self-organizing maps (SOM), and principal component (PC) analysis.Three trajectories were chosen for both internalizing and externalizing problems, with \"high\" (externalizing) or \"increasing\" (internalizing) being the most adverse trajectories. High externalizing trajectory was associated with increased particulate matter (PM10) exposure (OR [95%-CI]: 1.25 [1.01,1.55]) and SOM exposure profile most associated with smoking (2.67 [1.14,6.27]). Medium internalizing trajectory was associated with increased emotional intimate partner violence (2.66 [1.17,5.57]), increasing trajectory with increased benzene (1.24 [1.02,1.51]) and toluene (1.21 [1.02,1.44]) and the PC most correlated with benzene and toluene (1.25 [1.02, 1.54]).Prenatal exposure to environmental pollutants and psychosocial factors was associated with internalizing and externalizing child behavior trajectories. Understanding joint effects of adverse exposure mixtures will facilitate targeted interventions to prevent childhood psychopathology.Prenatal indoor air pollution and maternal psychosocial factors have been associated with adverse psychopathology. We used environmental exposure mixture methodology to investigate joint effects of both exposure classes on child behavior trajectories.","1709":"The RV144 HIV-1 clinical trial demonstrated modest vaccine efficacy and identified IgG antibodies against the Env V1V2 loop that inversely correlated with risk of infection. Based upon these results, we chose the Self-Assembling Protein Nanoparticle platform to present the V1V2 loop in a native-like conformation. We hypothesized this approach would lead to generation of conformation-specific IgG antibodies to V1V2. Our vaccine, V1V2-SHB-SAPN, was designed to present twenty copies of the V1V2 trimer. Particles were characterized for size, shape, and binding to monoclonal antibodies that recognize the V2 and V1V2 loops. Immunization induced IgG antibodies to V1, V2, V1V2 and to gp70V1V2 (AE\/A244) capture antigens in mice. The presence of the Army Liposome Formulation induced a four-fold increase in IgG titers to gp70V1V2 and the adjuvanted V1V2-SHB-SAPN group had statistically higher IgG titers than sequence- and dose-matched V1V2 peptide controls. In conclusion, V1V2-SHB-SAPN vaccine presented the V1V2 loop in native-like conformation, as indicated by PGT145 binding, and induced high titers of IgG antibodies.","1710":"Contact patterns play a key role in disease transmission, and variation in contacts during the course of illness can influence transmission, particularly when accompanied by changes in host infectiousness. We used surveys among 1,642 contacts of 94 Nipah case-patients in Bangladesh to determine how contact patterns (physical and with bodily fluids) changed as disease progressed in severity. The number of contacts increased with severity and, for case-patients who died, peaked on the day of death. Given transmission has only been observed among fatal Nipah cases, our findings suggest changes in contact patterns during illness contribute to risk of infection.","1711":"We analyzed spatiotemporal masking patterns in over 8 million behavioral survey responses from across the United States, starting in September 2020 through May 2021. We adjusted for sample size and representation using binomial regression models and survey raking, respectively, to produce county-level monthly estimates of masking behavior. We additionally debiased self-reported masking estimates using bias measures derived by comparing vaccination data from the same survey to official records at the county level. Lastly, we evaluated whether individuals' perceptions of their social environment can serve as a less biased form of behavioral surveillance than self-reported data.We found that county-level masking behavior was spatially heterogeneous along an urban-rural gradient, with mask wearing peaking in winter 2021 and declining sharply through May 2021. Our results identified regions where targeted public health efforts could have been most effective and suggest that individuals' frequency of mask wearing may be influenced by national guidance and disease prevalence. We validated our bias correction approach by comparing debiased self-reported mask-wearing estimates with community-reported estimates, after addressing issues of a small sample size and representation. Self-reported behavior estimates were especially prone to social desirability and nonresponse biases, and our findings demonstrated that these biases can be reduced if individuals are asked to report on community rather than self behaviors.Urgently needed is a debiased spatiotemporal characterization of mask-wearing behavior in the United States. This information is critical to further assess the effectiveness of masking, evaluate the drivers of transmission at different time points during the pandemic, and guide future public health decisions through, for example, forecasting disease surges.Face mask wearing has been identified as an effective strategy to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, yet mask mandates were never imposed nationally in the United States. This decision resulted in a patchwork of local policies and varying compliance, potentially generating heterogeneities in the local trajectories of COVID-19 in the United States. Although numerous studies have investigated the patterns and predictors of masking behavior nationally, most suffer from survey biases and none have been able to characterize mask wearing at fine spatial scales across the United States through different phases of the pandemic.Our work highlights the importance of characterizing public health behaviors at fine spatiotemporal scales to capture heterogeneities that may drive outbreak trajectories. Our findings also emphasize the need for a standardized approach to incorporating behavioral big data into public health response efforts. Even large surveys are prone to bias; thus, we advocate for a social sensing approach to behavioral surveillance to enable more accurate estimates of health behaviors. Finally, we invite the public health and behavioral research communities to use our publicly available estimates to consider how bias-corrected behavioral estimates may improve our understanding of protective behaviors during crises and their impact on disease dynamics.","1712":"The distribution and intensity of viral diseases transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, including dengue, have rapidly increased over the last century. Here, we study dengue virus (DENV) transmission across the ecologically and demographically distinct regions or Ecuador. We analyzed province-level age-stratified dengue incidence data from 2000-2019 using catalytic models to estimate the force of infection of DENV over eight decades. We found that provinces established endemic DENV transmission at different time periods. Coastal provinces with the largest and most connected cities had the earliest and highest increase in DENV transmission, starting around 1980 and continuing to the present. In contrast, remote and rural areas with reduced access, like the northern coast and the Amazon regions, experienced a rise in DENV transmission and endemicity only in the last 10 to 20 years. The newly introduced chikungunya and Zika viruses have age-specific distributions of hospital-seeking cases consistent with recent emergence across all provinces. To evaluate factors associated with geographic differences in DENV transmission potential, we modeled the DENV vector risk using 11,693 Aedes aegypti presence points to the resolution of 1 hectare. In total, 56% of the population of Ecuador, including in provinces identified as having increasing DENV transmission in our models, live in areas with high risk of Aedes aegypti, with population size, trash collection, elevation, and access to water as important determinants. Our investigation serves as a case study of the changes driving the expansion of DENV and other arboviruses globally and suggest that control efforts should be expanded to semi-urban and rural areas and to historically isolated regions to counteract increasing dengue outbreaks.","1713":"We identified vaccine coverage in those above 70\u00a0years old, number of ICU beds per capita, and the availability of antiviral treatment as the most important interventions for safe exits across all studied locations, although the thresholds required for safe exits vary remarkably with the assumed vaccine effectiveness, as well as the age structure, age-specific vaccine coverage, community healthcare capacity of the studied locations.We developed an individual-based model (IBM) to simulate the transmission of the Omicron variant in the synthetic population, accounting for the age-dependent probabilities of severe clinical outcomes, waning vaccine-induced immunity, increased mortality rates when hospitals are overburdened, and reduced transmission when self-isolated at home after testing positive. We applied machine learning algorithms on the simulation outputs to examine the importance of each intervention parameter and the feasible intervention parameter combinations for safe exits, which is defined as having mortality rates lower than that of influenza in China (14.3 per 100, 000 persons).The analytical framework developed here can provide the basis for further policy decisions that incorporate considerations about economic costs and societal impacts. Achieving safe exits from the Zero-COVID policy is possible, but challenging for China's cities. When planning for safe exits, local realities such as the age structure and current age-specific vaccine coverage must be taken into consideration.Although several pathways have been proposed as the prerequisite for a safe phase-out in China, it is not clear which of them are the most important for keeping the mortality rate low, what thresholds should be achieved for these most important interventions, and how the thresholds change with the assumed key epidemiological parameters and population characteristics.","1714":"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is associated with microcephaly and other birth defects, collectively termed Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS). During the epidemic in 2015-16, ZIKV spread through the Americas and quickly joined the list of other known teratogenic pathogens, TORCH. Multiple ZIKV vaccines have been developed for protection of pregnant women and women of childbearing age. However, ZIKV infection incidence has since waned substantially, and adverse birth outcomes are rare outcomes of infection. Studying a vaccine's protective efficacy against CZS in a large phase III clinical trial may be infeasible in such times of low incidence. Should trials be initiated, researchers may resort to alternative clinical endpoints. In this study, we simulate a variety of vaccine clinical trial scenarios to evaluate the feasibility of the CZS endpoint in vaccine studies and compare CZS to other potential outcomes: ZIKV infection detected through weekly, biweekly, or monthly testing and laboratory-confirmed, symptomatic Zika Virus Disease. We compare the sample size required for 80% statistical power to detect vaccine efficacy and trial duration for each scenario. Our results show the feasibility of CZS clinical endpoints depends on the timing of simulated clinical trials in the course of a seasonal epidemic, due to CZS risk varying with trimester of infection. This result highlights additional considerations needed when designing vaccine efficacy trials of protection against teratogenic pathogens.","1715":"An incidence approach and societal perspective were used to estimate the total cost-of-illness for LB in Belgium. Costs were calculated for patients with erythema migrans (EM) or disseminated\/late LB, including patients who developed post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). Direct medical, direct non-medical (transportation & paid help) and indirect non-medical costs (productivity losses) were included in the analysis. Ambulatory cost data were collected through a prospective cohort study from June 2016 to March 2020, in which patients with LB were followed up 6 to 12\u00a0months after diagnosis. Hospitalization costs were retrieved from the Minimal Clinical Data registry, a mandatory registry for all Belgian hospitals, linked to the Minimal Financial Data registry. Costs were expressed in 2019 euros.Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common tick-borne disease in Europe and North America, yet its economic burden remains largely unknown. This study aimed to estimate the economic cost associated with the different clinical manifestations of LB in Belgium.The total annual cost associated with clinical manifestations of LB in Belgium was estimated at \u20ac5.59 million (95% UI 3.82-7.98). Of these, \u20ac3.44 million (95% UI 2.05-5.48) or 62% was related to disseminated\/late LB diagnoses and \u20ac2.15 million (95% UI 1.30-3.26) to EM. In general, direct medical costs and productivity losses accounted for 49.8% and 46.4% of the total costs, respectively, while direct non-medical costs accounted for only 3.8%. The estimated mean costs were \u20ac193 per EM patient and \u20ac5,148 per disseminated\/late LB patient. While patients with PTLDS seemed to have somewhat higher costs compared to patients without PTLDS, the number of patients was too small to have representative estimates.We estimate the total annual direct medical costs, direct non-medical and indirect non-medical costs associated with LB to exceed \u20ac5.5 million per year, almost evenly distributed between EM (40%) and disseminated\/late LB (60%). EM costs 26 times less per patient but occurs also 16 times more frequently than disseminated\/late LB. The cost burden remains limited by comparison to other infectious diseases due to the relative lower incidence.","1716":"The skin harbors diverse communities of microorganisms, and alterations to these communities can impact the effectiveness of the skin as a barrier to infectious organisms or injury. As the global availability and adoption of antibacterial products increases, it is important to understand how these products affect skin microbial communities of people living in rural areas of developing countries, where risks of infection and injury often differ from urban populations in developed countries. We investigated the effect of antibacterial soap on skin microbial communities in a rural Malagasy population that practices subsistence agriculture in the absence of electricity and running water. We quantified the amount of soap used by each participant and obtained skin swab samples at three time points: prior to soap use, immediately after one week of soap use, and two weeks after soap use was discontinued. Soap use did not significantly impact ecological measures of diversity and richness (alpha diversity). However, the amount of soap used was a predictor of community-level change (beta diversity), with changes persisting for at least two weeks after subjects stopped using soap. Our results indicate that the overall species richness of skin microbial communities may be resistant to short-term use of antibacterial soap in settings characterized by regular contact with the natural environment, yet these communities may undergo shifts in microbial composition. Lifestyle changes associated with the use of antibacterial soap may therefore cause rapid alterations in skin microbial communities, with the potential for effects on skin health.","1717":"Across the United States public health community in 2020, in the midst of a pandemic and increased concern regarding racial\/ethnic health disparities, there is widespread concern about our ability to accurately estimate small-area disease incidence rates due to the absence of a recent census to obtain reliable population denominators. 2010 decennial census data are likely outdated, and intercensal population estimates from the Census Bureau, which are less temporally misaligned with real-time disease incidence data, are not recommended for use with small areas. Machine learning-based population estimates are an attractive option but have not been validated for use in epidemiologic studies. Treating 2010 decennial census counts as a \"ground truth\", we conduct a case study to compare the performance of alternative small-area population denominator estimates from surrounding years for modeling real-time disease incidence rates. Our case study focuses on modeling health disparities in census tract incidence rates in Massachusetts, using population size estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS), the most commonly-used intercensal small-area population data in epidemiology, and WorldPop, a machine learning model for high-resolution population size estimation. Through simulation studies and an analysis of real premature mortality data, we evaluate whether WorldPop denominators can provide improved performance relative to ACS for quantifying disparities using both census tract-aggregate and race-stratified modeling approaches. We find that biases induced in parameter estimates due to temporally incompatible incidence and denominator data tend to be larger for race-stratified models than for area-aggregate models. In most scenarios considered here, WorldPop denominators lead to greater bias in estimates of health disparities than ACS denominators. These insights will assist researchers in intercensal years to select appropriate population size estimates for modeling disparities in real-time disease incidence. We highlight implications for health disparity studies in the coming decade, as 2020 census counts may introduce new sources of error.","1718":"As the COVID-19 pandemic drags into its second year, there is hope on the horizon, in the form of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines which promise disease suppression and a return to pre-pandemic normalcy. In this study we critically examine the basis for that hope, using an epidemiological modeling framework to establish the link between vaccine characteristics and effectiveness in bringing an end to this unprecedented public health crisis. Our findings suggest that a return to pre-pandemic social and economic conditions without fully suppressing SARS-CoV-2 will lead to extensive viral spread, resulting in a high disease burden even in the presence of vaccines that reduce risk of infection and mortality. Our modeling points to the feasibility of complete SARS-CoV-2 suppression with high population-level compliance and vaccines that are highly effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, vaccine-mediated reduction of transmission is critical for viral suppression, and in order for partially-effective vaccines to play a positive role in SARS-CoV-2 suppression, complementary biomedical interventions and public health measures must be deployed simultaneously.","1719":"Chlorcyclizine HCl (CCZ) is a piperazine-class antihistamine with anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) activity in vitro and in vivo. In a first-in-humans study for HCV, we evaluated the antiviral effects and safety of CCZ\u00b1ribavirin (RBV), characterized pharmacokinetic (PK) and viral kinetic (VK) patterns, and provide insights into CCZs mode of action against HCV.24 HCV patients were treated; 54% male, median age 56 years, median HCV RNA 6.30 log IU\/ml, without baseline differences between groups. At the end of therapy, subjects treated with CCZ monotherapy did not show any significant or sustained reduction in viremia (p\u00a0=\u00a00.69), whereas 7\/12 (58%) subjects treated with CCZ+RBV had a >3-fold decline in HCV RNA. Subjects who responded demonstrated monophasic (n\u00a0=\u00a02), biphasic (n\u00a0=\u00a02) and triphasic (n\u00a0=\u00a03) VK responses. Contrary to historical RBV monotherapy response, CCZ+RBV demonstrated a continued viral decline suggesting a possible synergistic effect of CCZ+RBV. Mathematical modeling predicts a median effectiveness of CCZ+RBV in blocking viral production (\u03b5) of 59% (Interquartile range, IQR: 50%) and blocking infection (\u03b7) of 78% (IQR: 23%). Adverse events (AEs) were mild-moderate without treatment discontinuations for AEs.Chronic HCV patients were randomized to CCZ (75\u00a0mg twice daily) or CCZ+weight-based RBV (1000\/1200\u00a0mg daily) for 28 days. Therapy started with a loading dose of CCZ 150\u00a0mg\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0RBV. Serial assessments of safety, liver tests, PK and VK markers were obtained.In this human pilot study, CCZ demonstrated some anti-HCV effects, mostly in combination with RBV. More potent CCZ derivatives with optimal PK features may be more suitable for future therapeutic development. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT02118012.","1720":"We study the spatio-temporal spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Santiago de Chile using anonymized mobile phone data from 1.4 million users, 22% of the whole population in the area, characterizing the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the epidemic dynamics. We integrate these data into a mechanistic epidemic model calibrated on surveillance data. As of August 1, 2020, we estimate a detection rate of 102 cases per 1000 infections (90% CI: [95-112 per 1000]). We show that the introduction of a full lockdown on May 15, 2020, while causing a modest additional decrease in mobility and contacts with respect to previous NPIs, was decisive in bringing the epidemic under control, highlighting the importance of a timely governmental response to COVID-19 outbreaks. We find that the impact of NPIs on individuals' mobility correlates with the Human Development Index of comunas in the city. Indeed, more developed and wealthier areas became more isolated after government interventions and experienced a significantly lower burden of the pandemic. The heterogeneity of COVID-19 impact raises important issues in the implementation of NPIs and highlights the challenges that communities affected by systemic health and social inequalities face adapting their behaviors during an epidemic.","1721":"Cat owners were surveyed about their preferences for and experiences in giving oral medications to cats and their experiences with antimicrobials specifically. Veterinarians were interviewed about antimicrobial use decisions in cats, benefits and drawbacks of cefovecin, and their perspectives on antimicrobial resistance.To understand veterinarian and cat owner perspectives on antimicrobial use in cats, reasons for prescribing cefovecin, and barriers to improving antimicrobial stewardship, including veterinarian and cat owner perspectives of giving oral medication to cats.Many veterinarians reported feeling pressure to prescribe antimicrobials, while 41% of cat owners reported requesting antimicrobials. Although veterinarians are aware of the downsides of prescribing cefovecin, many prescribed cefovecin in situations where an antimicrobial was not needed or cefovecin may not have been the best choice. Veterinarians thought that 20% of cat owners could not give oral medications, but < 10% of cat owners had a cat that was impossible to medicate.21 New York veterinarians and 600 cat owners across the US.The disconnect between veterinarians' assessment of and cat owners' reported abilities in administering oral medication may contribute to cefovecin use. Demonstrating for cat owners how to give oral medication may help improve compliance and reduce the use of parenteral long-acting formulations. Structural and educational interventions are needed to address other contributors to inappropriate antimicrobial use. This research provides the specific considerations about barriers and motivations for cat owners and veterinarians that are required to guide strategic, tailored interventions for both audiences to advance stewardship.","1722":"The incubation period, or the time from infection to symptom onset, of COVID-19 has usually been estimated by using data collected through interviews with cases and their contacts. However, this estimation is influenced by uncertainty in the cases' recall of exposure time. We propose a novel method that uses viral load data collected over time since hospitalization, hindcasting the timing of infection with a mathematical model for viral dynamics. As an example, we used reported data on viral load for 30 hospitalized patients from multiple countries (Singapore, China, Germany, and Korea) and estimated the incubation period. The median, 2.5, and 97.5 percentiles of the incubation period were 5.85 days (95 % CI: 5.05, 6.77), 2.65 days (2.04, 3.41), and 12.99 days (9.98, 16.79), respectively, which are comparable to the values estimated in previous studies. Using viral load to estimate the incubation period might be a useful approach, especially when it is impractical to directly observe the infection event.","1723":"Indoor and outdoor concentrations of PM2.5 were measured for 24\u00a0h during heating and non-heating seasons in a rural solid fuel burning Native American community. Household building characteristics were collected during the initial home sampling visit using technician walkthrough questionnaires, and behavioral factors were collected through questionnaires by interviewers. To identify seasonal behavioral factors and household characteristics associated with indoor PM2.5 , data were analyzed separately by heating and non-heating seasons using multivariable regression. Concentrations of PM2.5 were significantly higher during the heating season (indoor: 36.2\u00a0\u03bcg\/m3 ; outdoor: 22.1\u00a0\u03bcg\/m3 ) compared with the non-heating season (indoor: 14.6\u00a0\u03bcg\/m3 ; outdoor: 9.3\u00a0\u03bcg\/m3 ). Heating season indoor PM2.5 was strongly associated with heating fuel type, housing type, indoor pests, use of a climate control unit, number of interior doors, and indoor relative humidity. During the non-heating season, different behavioral and household characteristics were associated with indoor PM2.5 concentrations (indoor smoking and\/or burning incense, opening doors and windows, area of surrounding environment, building size and height, and outdoor PM2.5 ). Homes heated with coal and\/or wood, or a combination of coal and\/or wood with electricity and\/or natural gas had elevated indoor PM2.5 concentrations that exceeded both the EPA ambient standard (35\u00a0\u03bcg\/m3 ) and the WHO guideline (25\u00a0\u03bcg\/m3 ).","1724":"Background: Among young people who inject drugs (PWID) homelessness is associated with numerous adverse psychosocial and health consequences, including risk of relapse and overdose, psychological distress and suicidality, limited treatment access, and injection practices that increase the risk of HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) transmission. Homeless PWID may also be less likely to access sterile syringes through pharmacies or syringe service programs.\r\n\r\nMethods: This study applied random-effects meta-regression to examine trends over time in injection risk behaviors and homelessness among young PWID in Chicago and surrounding suburban and rural areas using data from 11 studies collected between 1997 and 2017. In addition, subject-level data were pooled to evaluate the effect of homelessness on risk behaviors across all studies using mixed effects logistic and negative binomial regression with random study effects.\r\n\r\nResults: There was a significant increase in homelessness among young PWID over time, consistent with the general population trend of increasing youth homelessness. In mixed-effects regression, homelessness was associated with injection risk behaviors (receptive syringe sharing, syringe mediated sharing, equipment sharing) and exchange sex, though we detected no overall changes in risk behavior over time.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Increases over time in homelessness among young PWID highlight a need for research to understand factors contributing to youth homelessness to inform HIV\/STI, HCV, and overdose prevention and intervention services for this population.","1725":"Potential interactions among co-circulating viral strains in host populations are often overlooked in the study of virus transmission. However, these interactions probably shape transmission dynamics by influencing host immune responses or altering the relative fitness among co-circulating strains. In this Review, we describe multi-strain dynamics from ecological and evolutionary perspectives, outline scales in which multi-strain dynamics occur and summarize important immunological, phylogenetic and mathematical modelling approaches used to quantify interactions among strains. We also discuss how host-pathogen interactions influence the co-circulation of pathogens. Finally, we highlight outstanding questions and knowledge gaps in the current theory and study of ecological and evolutionary dynamics of multi-strain viruses.","1726":"Prevalence rates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) across the globe and lifespan suggest that law enforcement officers (LEOs) are likely to interact with autistic people in their professional duties. In developed countries, LEOs have professional encounters with autistic individuals, and research strongly supports LEOs need training to increase their knowledge about autism and confidence interacting with autistic people. The purpose of the present study is to compare three training approaches with LEOs: (a) a training presentation alone (P), (b) a training presentation combined with virtual reality simulation (P\u2009+\u2009VR), and (c) a training presentation combined with in-vivo simulation (P\u2009+\u2009SIM). The primary outcomes are LEO knowledge of autism and self-reported confidence in responding to autism calls. The present study included 259 LEOS who completed a survey assessing autism knowledge and confidence in level of skill before and after participating in ASD-specific training for LEOs. Findings support that participant knowledge of autism and confidence in responding significantly increased for all LEOs equally across training conditions. Results support that formalized training in ASD significantly impacts LEO's knowledge of ASD and confidence responding to calls. As such, standardized training for LEOs is needed to assure appropriate knowledge and confidence when responding to calls involving autistic persons.","1727":"We reviewed the currently available literature to provide up-to-date guidance on control measures to be implemented by public health authorities.Additional studies incorporating more detailed information from confirmed cases would be valuable.The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Wuhan, China is currently recognized as a public health emergency of global concern.Some of the epidemiological characteristics of 2019-nCoV have been identified. However, there remain considerable uncertainties, which should be considered when providing guidance to public health authorities on control measures.","1728":"Modern food systems facilitate rapid dispersal of pests and pathogens through multiple pathways. The complexity of spread dynamics and data inadequacy make it challenging to model the phenomenon and also to prepare for emerging invasions. We present a generic framework to study the spatio-temporal spread of invasive species as a multi-scale propagation process over a time-varying network accounting for climate, biology, seasonal production, trade and demographic information. Machine learning techniques are used in a novel manner to capture model variability and analyse parameter sensitivity. We applied the framework to understand the spread of a devastating pest of tomato, Tuta absoluta, in South and Southeast Asia, a region at the frontier of its current range. Analysis with respect to historical invasion records suggests that even with modest self-mediated spread capabilities, the pest can quickly expand its range through domestic city-to-city vegetable trade. Our models forecast that within 5-7 years, Tuta absoluta will invade all major vegetable growing areas of mainland Southeast Asia assuming unmitigated spread. Monitoring high-consumption areas can help in early detection, and targeted interventions at major production areas can effectively reduce the rate of spread.","1729":"We identified 557,555 patients aged 25+ years diagnosed with lung\/bronchus carcinoma from the SEER database, 2000-2016. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) for demographic (sex, age, race and ethnicity), tumor (stage, histology, year of diagnosis), and geographic characteristics (census-tract-level urbanicity, socioeconomic status (SES)), as well as selected interactions, on the rate of lung-cancer-specific death using multivariable proportional hazards models.Disparities in survival after lung cancer diagnosis remain, with intersectional patterns suggesting differential access to and quality of care. Efforts are needed to ensure high-risk groups receive guideline-concordant treatment.Understanding the impact of patient and tumor characteristics on lung cancer survival can help to build personalized prognostic models and identify health disparities.Females had a higher survival (lower hazard) of lung-cancer-specific death than males (HR 0.83, 95% CI: 0.82, 0.83). Hazards differed by race and ethnicity. Regional (HR: 2.41, 95% CI: 2.37, 2.44) and distant (HR: 6.61, 95% CI: 6.53, 6.69) tumors were associated with a lower survival (higher hazard) than localized tumors. Small-cell tumors were associated with a lower survival (HR 1.19, 95% CI: 1.18, 1.20) than non-small-cell tumors. Patients diagnosed after 2009 had lower hazards (HR 0.86, 95% CI: 085, 0.86) than those diagnosed 2000-2009. Lung-cancer-specific survival did not depend on urbanicity after adjusting for census-tract-level SES, but survival decreased with decreasing census-tract-level SES. Differences in survival between non-Hispanic Black and White patients were greater for younger patients and localized tumors and increased with census-tract-level SES. Differences by sex were greatest for young patients and localized tumors.","1730":"Influenza virus can survive on some surfaces, facilitating indirect person-to-person transmission. We collected swab samples weekly from commonly-touched surfaces in 7 kindergartens and primary schools during the 2017\/18 winter influenza season in Hong Kong. We detected influenza virus RNA in 12\/1352 samples (<1%) collected from 7\/11 classrooms (5-2x106 RNA copies\/ml). Viral RNA was more frequently recovered from communal items inside classrooms such as bookshelves and doorknobs, suggesting these surfaces may cause greater potential risks of transmission during influenza epidemics. Surface contamination indicates the potential role of fomites in influenza virus transmission in schools.","1731":"Process-based models have been used to simulate and forecast a number of nonlinear dynamical systems, including influenza and other infectious diseases. In this work, we evaluate the effects of model initial condition error and stochastic fluctuation on forecast accuracy in a compartmental model of influenza transmission. These two types of errors are found to have qualitatively similar growth patterns during model integration, indicating that dynamic error growth, regardless of source, is a dominant component of forecast inaccuracy. We therefore examine the nonlinear growth of model initial error and compute the fastest growing directions using singular vector analysis. Using this information, we generate perturbations in an ensemble forecast system of influenza to obtain more optimal ensemble spread. In retrospective forecasts of historical outbreaks for 95 US cities from 2003 to 2014, this approach improves short-term forecast of incidence over the next one to four weeks.","1732":"Investment in sustainable production and maintenance of supplies for oxygen therapy, along with messaging around early and appropriate use for healthcare providers, caregivers and patients could reduce COVID-19 deaths in SSA. Further investigation into convalescent plasma is warranted until data on its effectiveness specifically in treating COVID-19 becomes available. The success of supportive or curative clinical interventions will depend on earlier treatment seeking, such that community engagement and risk communication will be critical components of the response.Across SSA, deceased cases for which demographic data were available were predominantly male (63\/103, 61.2%) and aged >50 years (59\/75, 78.7%). In Burkina Faso, specifically, the majority of deceased cases either did not seek care at all or were hospitalized for a single day (59.4%, 19\/32). Hypertension and diabetes were often reported as underlying conditions. After adjustment for sex, age and underlying conditions in the synthetic case population, the odds of mortality for cases not receiving oxygen therapy were significantly higher than for those receiving oxygen, such as due to disruptions to standard care (OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.56-2.75). Cases receiving convalescent plasma had 50% reduced odds of mortality than those who did not (95% CI 0.24-0.93).Data from deceased cases reported across SSA through 10 May 2020 and from hospitalized cases in Burkina Faso through 15 April 2020 were analyzed. Demographic, epidemiological and clinical information on deceased cases in SSA was derived through a line-list of publicly available information and, for cases in Burkina Faso, from aggregate records at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Tengandogo in Ouagadougou. A synthetic case population was probabilistically derived using distributions of age, sex and underlying conditions from populations of West African countries to assess individual risk factors and treatment effect sizes. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the adjusted odds of survival for patients receiving oxygen therapy or convalescent plasma, based on therapeutic effectiveness observed for other respiratory illnesses.Absolute numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported to date in the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region have been significantly lower than those across the Americas, Asia and Europe. As a result, there has been limited information about the demographic and clinical characteristics of deceased cases in the region, as well as the impacts of different case management strategies.","1733":" correlate with expression of ultraviolet response genes under selection in Eurasians.","1734":"Better methods to predict and prevent the emergence of zoonotic viruses could support future efforts to reduce the risk of epidemics. We propose a network science framework for understanding and predicting human and animal susceptibility to viral infections. Related approaches have so far helped to identify basic biological rules that govern cross-species transmission and structure the global virome. We highlight ways to make modelling both accurate and actionable, and discuss the barriers that prevent researchers from translating viral ecology into public health policies that could prevent future pandemics.","1735":"Sex tourism affects the sexual health of tourists and locals with whom they interact. However, a few studies have examined whether sex tourism is a risk factor for the acquisition of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections among men who have sex with men, and no such studies have been conducted in Western Europe. Almost 28% of our respondents reported engaging in sex tourism in their lifetime. Sex tourism was associated with an elevated risk of engagement in condomless receptive anal intercourse, use of alcohol\/drugs during sex, participation in group sex, and an elevated risk of diagnosis with any type of sexually transmitted infection over the previous year, specifically gonorrhea and chlamydia. Research with men who have sex with men who engage in sex tourism should explore high-risk sexual behavior during sex tourism and also the feasibility and acceptability of the use of episodic pre-exposure prophylaxis for short periods of participation in elevated risk behaviors by tourists and local sex partners.","1736":"Many pathogens continuously change their protein structure in response to immune-driven selection, resulting in weakened protection. In addition, for some pathogens such as dengue virus, poorly targeted immunity is associated with increased risk of severe disease, through a mechanism known as antibody-dependent enhancement. However, it remains a mystery whether the antigenic distance between an individual's first infection and subsequent exposures dictate disease risk, explaining the observed large-scale differences in dengue hospitalisations across years. Here we develop an inferential framework that combines detailed antigenic and genetic characterisation of viruses, and hospitalised cases from 21 years of surveillance in Bangkok, Thailand to identify the role of the antigenic profile of circulating viruses in determining disease risk. We find that the risk of hospitalisation depends on both the specific order of infecting serotypes and the antigenic distance between an individual's primary and secondary infections, with risk maximised at intermediate antigenic distances. These findings suggest immune imprinting helps determine dengue disease risk, and provides a pathway to monitor the changing risk profile of populations and to quantifying risk profiles of candidate vaccines.","1737":"Immunosuppressants are increasingly being used in the clinic to manage immune-related adverse effects. Consequently, the incidence of secondary infections associated with immunosuppression is increasing. However, little is known about primary infections during immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment without immunosuppressants. We aimed to evaluate primary infectious diseases during antiprogrammed death ligand-1 immunotherapy without immunosuppressants. We retrospectively screened medical records of 233 patients who underwent ICI treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer between January 2014 and May 2018 at National Cancer Center, Republic of Korea. Subsequently, we evaluated the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of selected patients hospitalized for potential infectious disease without immunosuppressive treatment (n=80). Eight cases (3.4%) were identified as bacterial pneumonia (n=5) and cellulitis, inflamed epidermoid cyst, and wound infection (n=1 each). The bacterial pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were identified in 4 patients with pneumonia. The period between the start of ICI treatment and infection varied between 3 and 189 days (median, 24.5 days). Five (62.5%) patients were infected within a month after ICI treatment initiation. All patients were treated with empirical antibiotics and discharged without complications. The median progression-free and overall survival for ICI treatment was 11.5 and 25.5 months, respectively. Six patients experienced ICI-associated adverse effects postinfection: Herpes zoster infection (n=4) and pneumonitis (n=2). Infectious disease independent of immunosuppression is a rare, but possible event in patients with lung cancer receiving ICI treatment. Clinical awareness would enable prompt diagnosis of primary infection during immunotherapy.","1738":"Quantifying a node's importance is decisive for developing efficient strategies to curb or accelerate any spreading phenomena. Centrality measures are well-known methods used to quantify the influence of nodes by extracting information from the network's structure. The pitfall of these measures is to pinpoint nodes located in the vicinity of each other, saturating their shared zone of influence. In this paper, we propose a ranking strategy exploiting the ubiquity of the community structure in real-world networks. The proposed community-aware ranking strategy naturally selects a set of distant spreaders with the most significant influence in the networks. One can use it with any centrality measure. We investigate its effectiveness using real-world and synthetic networks with controlled parameters in a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) diffusion model scenario. Experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed ranking strategy over all its counterparts agnostic about the community structure. Additionally, results show that it performs better in networks with a strong community structure and a high number of communities of heterogeneous sizes.","1739":"Background\r\nAcute kidney injury independently predicts mortality in falciparum malaria. It is unknown whether acetaminophen\u0092s capacity to inhibit plasma hemoglobin-mediated oxidation is renoprotective in severe malaria.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nThis phase 2, open-label, randomized controlled trial conducted at two hospitals in Bangladesh assessed effects on renal function, safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of acetaminophen. Febrile patients (>12 years) with severe falciparum malaria were randomly assigned to receive acetaminophen (1 g 6\u0096hourly for 72 hours) or no acetaminophen, in addition to intravenous artesunate. Primary outcome was the proportional change in creatinine after 72 hours stratified by median plasma hemoglobin.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nBetween 2012 and 2014, 62 patients were randomly assigned to receive acetaminophen (n = 31) or no acetaminophen (n = 31). Median (interquartile range) reduction in creatinine after 72 hours was 23% (37% to 18%) in patients assigned to acetaminophen, versus 14% (29% to 0%) in patients assigned to no acetaminophen (P = .043). This difference in reduction was 37% (48% to 22%) versus 14% (30% to \u221271%) in patients with hemoglobin \u226545000 ng\/mL (P = .010). The proportion with progressing kidney injury was higher among controls (subdistribution hazard ratio, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 8.5; P = .034). PK\u0096PD analyses showed that higher exposure to acetaminophen increased the probability of creatinine improvement. No patient fulfilled Hy\u0092s law for hepatotoxicity.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nIn this proof-of-principle study, acetaminophen showed renoprotection without evidence of safety concerns in patients with severe falciparum malaria, particularly in those with prominent intravascular hemolysis.","1740":"Understanding the impact that specific NPIs have had on SARS-CoV-2 transmission is complicated by temporal clustering, time-dependent variation in effects, and differences in NPI intensity. However, the effectiveness of school closure and internal movement restrictions appears robust across different model specifications, with some evidence that other NPIs may also be effective under particular conditions. This provides empirical evidence for the potential effectiveness of many, although not all, actions policy-makers are taking to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic., levels of NPI intensity, time-varying changes in NPI effect, and variable selection criteria. Results were interpreted taking into account both the range of model specifications and temporal clustering of NPIs.. Another three NPIs (workplace closure, income support, and debt\/contract relief) had strong evidence of effectiveness when ignoring their level of intensity, while two NPIs (public events cancellation, restriction on gatherings) had strong evidence of their effectiveness only when evaluating their implementation at maximum capacity (e.g. restrictions on 1000+ people gathering were not effective, restrictions on <\u200910 people gathering were). Evidence about the effectiveness of the remaining NPIs (stay-at-home requirements, public information campaigns, public transport closure, international travel controls, testing, contact tracing) was inconsistent and inconclusive. We found temporal clustering between many of the NPIs. Effect sizes varied depending on whether or not we included data after peak NPI intensity.Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are used to reduce transmission of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of specific NPIs has been inconsistent. We assessed the effectiveness of NPIs around internal containment and closure, international travel restrictions, economic measures, and health system actions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 130 countries and territories.","1741":" Johnson) offer a moderate level of cross-protection against the variant.","1742":" There was moderate evidence for an association of long-term TRAP exposure with diabetes.","1743":"Molecular dynamics is a powerful tool to investigate atomistic and mesoscopic phenomena in lipid bilayer systems. These studies have progressed with the advent of increased computational power, and efforts are now increasingly being directed toward investigating the role of curvature and bilayer morphology, as these are critical features of biological processes. Computational studies of lipid bilayers benefit from tools that can create starting configurations for molecular dynamics simulations, but the majority of such tools are restricted to generating flat bilayers. Generating curved bilayer configurations comes with practical complications and potential ramifications on physical properties in the simulated system if the bilayer is initiated in a high-strain state. We present a new tool for creating curved lipid bilayers that combines flexibility of shape, force field, model resolution, and bilayer composition. A key aspect of our approach is the use of the monolayer pivotal plane location to accurately estimate interleaflet area differences in a curved bilayer. Our tool is named BUMPy (Building Unique Membranes in Python), is written in Python, is fast, and has a simple command line interface.","1744":"Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is a major source of mortality for children in low resource settings. Alternative treatment models that improve acceptability and reduce caregiver burden are needed to improve treatment access. We assessed costs and cost-effectiveness of monthly vs. weekly follow-up (standard-of-care) for treating uncomplicated SAM in children 6-59 months of age. To do so, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of a cluster-randomized trial of treatment for newly-diagnosed uncomplicated SAM in northwestern Nigeria (clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT03140904). We collected empirical costing data from enrollment up to 3 months post-discharge. We quantified health outcomes as the fraction of children recovered at discharge (primary cost-effectiveness outcome), the fraction recovered 3 months post-discharge, and total DALYs due to acute malnutrition. We estimated cost-effectiveness from both provider and societal perspectives. Costs are reported in 2019 US dollars. Provider costs per child were $67.07 (95% confidence interval: $64.79, $69.29) under standard-of-care, and $78.74 ($77.06, $80.66) under monthly follow-up. Patient costs per child were $21.04 ($18.18, $23.51) under standard-of-care, and $14.16 ($12.79, $15.25) under monthly follow-up. Monthly follow-up performed worse than standard-of-care for each health outcome assessed and was dominated (produced worse health outcomes at higher cost) by the standard-of-care in cost-effectiveness analyses. This result was robust to statistical uncertainty and to alternative costing assumptions. These findings provide evidence against monthly follow-up for treatment of uncomplicated SAM in situations where weekly follow-up of patients is feasible. While monthly follow-up may reduce burdens on caregivers and providers, other approaches are needed to do so while maintaining the effectiveness of care.","1745":"The highly controlled migration of neutrophils toward the site of an infection can be altered when they are trained with lipopolysaccharides (LPS), with high dose LPS enhancing neutrophil migratory pattern toward the bacterial derived source signal and super-low dose LPS inducing either migration toward an intermediary signal or dysregulation and oscillatory movement. Empirical studies that use microfluidic chemotaxis-chip devices with two opposing chemoattractants showed differential neutrophil migration after challenge with different LPS doses. The epigenetic alterations responsible for changes in neutrophil migratory behavior are unknown. We developed two mathematical models that evaluate the mechanistic interactions responsible for neutrophil migratory decision-making when exposed to competing chemoattractants and challenged with LPS. The first model, which considers the interactions between the receptor densities of two competing chemoattractants, their kinases, and LPS, displayed bistability between high and low ratios of primary to intermediary chemoattractant receptor densities. In particular, at equilibrium, we observe equal receptor densities for low LPS ( 15ng\/mL). The second model, which included additional interactions with an extracellular signal-regulated kinase in both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms, has an additional dynamic outcome, oscillatory dynamics for both receptors, as seen in the data. In particular, it found equal receptor densities in the absence of oscillation for super-low and high LPS challenge (< 0.4 and 1.1 <LPS< 375 ng\/mL); equal receptor densities with oscillatory receptor dynamics for super-low LPS (0.5 < LPS376 ng\/mL). Predicting the mechanisms and the type of external LPS challenge responsible for neutrophils migration toward pro-inflammatory chemoattractants, migration toward pro-tolerant chemoattractants, or oscillatory movement is necessary knowledge in designing interventions against immune diseases, such as sepsis.","1746":"The optimal density of EEMS grids was determined based on a new workflow created using density clustering to define genomic clusters and the spatial distance between genomic clusters. Topological skeletons were used to capture the spatial distribution for each genomic cluster and to determine the EEMS grid density; i.e., both genomic and spatial clustering were used to guide the optimization of EEMS grids. Model accuracy for migration estimates using the optimized workflow was tested and compared to grid resolutions selected without the optimized workflow. As a test case, the optimized workflow was applied to genomic data generated from P. falciparum sampled in Cambodia and bordering regions, and migration maps were compared to estimates of malaria endemicity, as well as geographic properties of the study area, as a means of validating observed migration patterns.Optimized grids displayed both high model accuracy and reduced computing time compared to grid densities selected in an unguided manner. In addition, EEMS migration maps generated for P. falciparum using the optimized grid corresponded to estimates of malaria endemicity and geographic properties of the study region that might be expected to impact malaria parasite migration, supporting the validity of the observed migration patterns.Optimized grids reduce spatial uncertainty in the EEMS contours that can result from user-defined parameters, such as the resolution of the spatial grid used in the model. This workflow will be useful to a broad range of EEMS users as it can be applied to analyses involving other organisms of interest and geographic areas.Understanding the genetic structure of natural populations provides insight into the demographic and adaptive processes that have affected those populations. Such information, particularly when integrated with geospatial data, can have translational applications for a variety of fields, including public health. Estimated effective migration surfaces (EEMS) is an approach that allows visualization of the spatial patterns in genomic data to understand population structure and migration. In this study, we developed a workflow to optimize the resolution of spatial grids used to generate EEMS migration maps and applied this optimized workflow to estimate migration of Plasmodium falciparum in Cambodia and bordering regions of Thailand and Vietnam.","1747":" laboratories within which researchers can systematically evaluate bias, and inform analyses and study design.","1748":"Emerging evidence suggests a resurgence of COVID-19 in the coming years. It is thus critical to optimize emergency response planning from a broad, integrated perspective. We developed a mathematical model incorporating climate-driven variation in community transmissions and movement-modulated spatial diffusions of COVID-19 into various intervention scenarios. We find that an intensive 8-wk intervention targeting the reduction of local transmissibility and international travel is efficient and effective. Practically, we suggest a tiered implementation of this strategy where interventions are first implemented at locations in what we call the Global Intervention Hub, followed by timely interventions in secondary high-risk locations. We argue that thinking globally, categorizing locations in a hub-and-spoke intervention network, and acting locally, applying interventions at high-risk areas, is a functional strategy to avert the tremendous burden that would otherwise be placed on public health and society.","1749":"Our results using single and multi-pollutant modeling do not generally support an association between PCB or OCP exposure and PTC, but some associations in those born during peak production suggest that additional investigation into early-life exposures and subsequent thyroid cancer risk may be warranted.We investigated the relationship between serum PCB and OCP concentrations and papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) in 250 incident female PTC cases and 250 female controls frequency-matched on age, all residing in Connecticut. Interviews and serum samples were collected from 2010 to 2013. Samples were analyzed for 32 different chemicals using gas chromatography with isotope dilution high resolution mass spectrometry. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using single pollutant logistic regression models for concentrations (per interquartile range) of individual PCB\/OCP and summed groups of structurally or biologically similar PCB\/OCP, adjusted for education, family history of cancer, alcohol consumption, age, and body mass index. Sub-analyses included stratification by tumor size (\u2264 and >1\u00a0cm) and birth before or during peak PCB production (born in 1960 or earlier and born after 1960), as exposures during early life may be important. We also applied three multi-pollutant approaches (standard multi-pollutant regression, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, principal components regression analysis) to investigate associations with co-exposures to multiple PCB\/OCPs.Thyroid cancer incidence has increased substantially over the past decades, and environmental risk factors have been suggested to play a role. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and organochlorine pesticides (OCP) are established thyroid hormone disruptors, but their relationship to thyroid cancer is not known.No PCB\/OCPs were positively associated with PTC in primary analyses. Statistically significant associations were observed for 9 of the 32 chemicals and 3 summed groups of similar chemicals in the those born during peak production based on single-pollutant models. Multi-pollutant analyses suggested null associations overall.","1750":"Passively-generated mobile phone data is emerging as a potential data source for transportation research and applications. Despite the large amount of studies based on the mobile phone data, only a few have reported the properties of such data, and documented how they have processed the data. In this paper, we describe two types of common mobile phone data: Call Details Record (CDR) data and sightings data, and propose a data processing framework and the associated algorithms to address two key issues associated with the sightings data: locational uncertainty and oscillation. We show the effectiveness of our proposed methods in addressing these two issues compared to the state of art algorithms in the field. We also demonstrate that without proper processing applied to the data, the statistical regularity of human mobility patterns-a key, significant trait identified for human mobility-is over-estimated. We hope this study will stimulate more studies in examining the properties of such data and developing methods to address them. Though not as glamorous as those directly deriving insights on mobility patterns (such as statistical regularity), understanding properties of such data and developing methods to address them is a fundamental research topic on which important insights are derived on mobility patterns.","1751":"For this observational study, we analysed comprehensive death registrations in Chennai, from Jan 1, 2016, to June 30, 2021. We estimated expected mortality without the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic by fitting models to observed mortality time series during the pre-pandemic period, with stratification by age and sex. Additionally, we considered three periods of interest: the first 4 weeks of India's first lockdown (March 24 to April 20, 2020), the 4-month period including the first wave of the pandemic in Chennai (May 1 to Aug 31, 2020), and the 4-month period including the second wave of the pandemic in Chennai (March 1 to June 30, 2021). We computed the difference between observed and expected mortality from March 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021, and compared pandemic-associated mortality across socioeconomically distinct communities (measured with use of 2011 census of India data) with regression analyses.India has been severely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to shortcomings in disease surveillance, the burden of mortality associated with COVID-19 remains poorly understood. We aimed to assess changes in mortality during the pandemic in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, using data on all-cause mortality within the district.Between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021, 87\u2009870 deaths were registered in areas of Chennai district represented by the 2011 census, exceeding expected deaths by 25\u2009990 (95% uncertainty interval 25\u2009640-26\u2009360) or 5\u00b718 (5\u00b711-5\u00b725) excess deaths per 1000 people. Stratified by age, excess deaths numbered 21\u00b702 (20\u00b754-21\u00b749) excess deaths per 1000 people for individuals aged 60-69 years, 39\u00b774 (38\u00b773-40\u00b769) for those aged 70-79 years, and 96\u00b790 (93\u00b735-100\u00b716) for those aged 80 years or older. Neighbourhoods with lower socioeconomic status had 0\u00b77% to 2\u00b78% increases in pandemic-associated mortality per 1 SD increase in each measure of community disadvantage, due largely to a disproportionate increase in mortality within these neighbourhoods during the second wave. Conversely, differences in excess mortality across communities were not clearly associated with socioeconomic status measures during the first wave. For each increase by 1 SD in measures of community disadvantage, neighbourhoods had 3\u00b76% to 8\u00b76% lower pandemic-associated mortality during the first 4 weeks of India's country-wide lockdown, before widespread SARS-CoV-2 circulation was underway in Chennai. The greatest reductions in mortality during this early lockdown period were observed among men aged 20-29 years, with 58% (54-62) fewer deaths than expected from pre-pandemic trends.National Institute of General Medical Sciences, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, National Science Foundation.Mortality in Chennai increased substantially but heterogeneously during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the greatest burden concentrated in disadvantaged communities. Reported COVID-19 deaths greatly underestimated pandemic-associated mortality.For the Hindi translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.","1752":"We present two tools that identify household contacts at high risk for TB disease based on reportable information from patient and contacts alone. The performance of these tools is comparable to biomarkers that are both more costly and less feasible than this approach.Efficient contact investigation strategies are needed for the early diagnosis of TB disease and treatment of latent TB infections.Between September 2009 and August 2012, we conducted a prospective cohort study in Lima, Peru in which we enrolled and followed 14,044 household contacts of adult pulmonary TB patients. We used information from a subset of this cohort to derive two clinical prediction tools that identify contacts of TB patients at elevated risk of progressing to active disease by training multivariable models that predict (1) co-prevalent TB among all household contacts and (2) one-year incident TB among adult contacts. We validated the models in a geographically distinct sub-cohort and compared the relative utilities of clinical decisions based on these tools to existing strategies.In our cohort, 296 (2.1%) household contacts had co-prevalent TB and 145 (1.9%) adult contacts developed incident TB within one year of index patient diagnosis. We predicted co-prevalent disease using information that could be readily obtained at the time an index patient was diagnosed and predicted one-year incident TB by including additional contact-specific characteristics. The area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curves for co-prevalent TB and incident TB were 0.86 (95%CI 0.83 - 0.89) and 0.72 (0.67 - 0.77). These clinical tools give 5-10% higher relative utilities than existing methods.","1753":"European Union Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Programme (European Climate-Health Cluster), United Kingdom Research and Innovation.Historical records of sand fly vectors, human leishmaniasis, bioclimatic indicators, and environmental variables were integrated in a machine learning framework (XGBoost) to predict suitability in two past periods (2001-2010 and 2011-2020). We further assessed if predictions were associated with human and animal disease data from selected countries (France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain).An increase in the number of climatically suitable regions for leishmaniasis was detected, especially in southern and eastern countries, coupled with a northward expansion towards central Europe. The final model had excellent predictive ability (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.970 [0.947-0.993]), and the suitability predictions were positively associated with human leishmaniasis incidence and canine seroprevalence for Leishmania.This study demonstrates how key epidemiological data can be combined with open-source climatic and environmental information to develop an indicator that effectively tracks spatiotemporal changes in climatic suitability and disease risk. The positive association between the model predictions and human disease incidence demonstrates that this indicator could help target leishmaniasis surveillance to transmission hotspots.Leishmaniases are neglected diseases transmitted by sand flies. They disproportionately affect vulnerable groups globally. Understanding the relationship between climate and disease transmission allows the development of relevant decision-support tools for public health policy and surveillance. The aim of this modelling study was to develop an indicator that tracks climatic suitability for Leishmania infantum transmission in Europe at the subnational level.","1754":"The emergence of viral variants with altered phenotypes is a public health challenge underscoring the need for advanced evolutionary forecasting methods. Given extensive epistatic interactions within viral genomes and known viral evolutionary history, efficient genomic surveillance necessitates early detection of emerging viral haplotypes rather than commonly targeted single mutations. Haplotype inference, however, is a significantly more challenging problem precluding the use of traditional approaches. Here, using SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary dynamics as a case study, we show that emerging haplotypes with altered transmissibility can be linked to dense communities in coordinated substitution networks, which become discernible significantly earlier than the haplotypes become prevalent. From these insights, we develop a computational framework for inference of viral variants and validate it by successful early detection of known SARS-CoV-2 strains. Our methodology offers greater scalability than phylogenetic lineage tracing and can be applied to any rapidly evolving pathogen with adequate genomic surveillance data.","1755":"To examine the information about tinnitus contained in different video sources on YouTube.Of the videos, 42 were consumer-generated, 33 from media, and 25 from professionals.

Data come from a cross-sectional study conducted in eight cities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shenzhen, Kunming, Jiaozhou, Yunfu, Xiangyang and Longnan) throughout seven provinces in China between August 17 and October 17, 2019. We used logistic regression to compare odds of consistent condom use with clients between FSW who do and do not use biomedical contraceptives (defined as oral pills, injectables\/implants\/patches\/rings, intrauterine devices, and sterilization) and assessed subgroup effects of interest. Of the 1229 participants, 62.4% reported ever having an unintended pregnancy. Biomedical contraceptive use was non-significantly associated with consistent condom use with clients generally (aOR= 0.95, 95% CI:0.75-1.21). This association between biomedical contraceptive use and consistent condom use was lower among FSW with at least a high school education (aOR=0.33 95% CI: 0.18-0.62) and those who had never married (aOR=0.60, 95% CI: 0.38-0.93); it was higher among FSW employed at middle tier commercial sex venues (aOR=1.67, 95% CI: 1.13-2.45). Taken together these findings highlight the pressing unmet need for contraceptives in Chinese FSW and the complex interplay between reproductive and sexual health needs in this key population.","1757":"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, many have worried that the additional burden of seasonal influenza would create a devastating scenario, resulting in overwhelmed healthcare capacities and further loss of life. However, many were pleasantly surprised: the 2020 Southern Hemisphere and 2020-2021 Northern Hemisphere influenza seasons were entirely suppressed. The potential causes and impacts of this drastic public health shift are highly uncertain, but provide lessons about future control of respiratory diseases, especially for the upcoming influenza season.","1758":"Not applicable.To evaluate the effectiveness and cost of the pan-London pharmacy initiative, a programme that allows administration of seasonal influenza vaccination to eligible patients at pharmacies.We analysed 2013-2015 data on vaccination uptake in pharmacies via the Sonar reporting system, and the total vaccination uptake via 2011-2015 ImmForm general practitioner (GP) reporting system data. We conducted an online survey of London pharmacists who participate in the programme to assess time use data, vaccine choice, investment costs and opinions about the programme. We conducted an online survey of London GPs to assess vaccine choice of vaccine and opinions about the pharmacy vaccine delivery programme.Comparison of annual vaccine uptake in London across risk groups from years before pharmacy vaccination introduction to after pharmacy vaccination introduction. Completeness of vaccine uptake reporting data. Cost to the National Health Service (NHS) of flu vaccine delivery at pharmacies with that at GPs. Cost to pharmacists of flu delivery. Opinions of pharmacists and GPs regarding the flu vaccine pharmacy initiative.No significant change in the uptake of seasonal vaccination in any of the risk groups as a result of the pharmacy initiative. While on average a pharmacy-administered flu vaccine dose costs the NHS up to \u00a32.35 less than a dose administered at a GP, a comparison of the 2 recording systems suggests there is substantial loss of data.All London boroughs.London-based GPs, and pharmacies that currently offer seasonal flu vaccination.Flu vaccine delivery through pharmacies shows potential for improving convenience for vaccine recipients. However, there is no evidence that vaccination uptake increases and the use of 2 separate recording systems leads to time-consuming data entry and missing vaccine record data.","1759":"Clinical trials conducted before the introduction of modern medical management to prevent stroke demonstrated that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS) prevent stroke following transient ischemic attack (TIA). We compared the cost-effectiveness of CEA, CAS, and modern medical management in two secular settings of medical management in individuals with incident TIA and type 2 diabetes.Using simulation modeling, our base-case analyses were performed from the healthcare sector perspective over a 20-year time horizon with an annual 3% discount rate applied to both costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Outcomes depended on age, sex, biomarkers associated with cardiovascular risk, and treatment effects based on a validated model of type 2 diabetes. Our simulation population was drawn from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2014 cohort. Costs for modern medical management were based on average wholesale prices, and revascularization costs were derived from published literature. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.Among individuals requiring carotid revascularization, carotid endarterectomy is the cost-effective strategy to treat individuals with type 2 diabetes following a TIA. For individuals for whom revascularization is contraindicated, modern medical therapy is cost-effective.Compared to all other strategies, historical medical management plus CEA was either cost-saving or cost-effective at a threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained. Modern medical management was cost-effective compared to historical medical management without revascularization at a $100,000 acceptability threshold. However, both revascularization approaches (plus medical management) were cost-saving compared to modern medical management alone.","1760":"Climate change is projected to increase the risk of dust storms, particularly in subtropical dryland, including the southwestern US. Research on dust storm's health impacts in the US is limited and hindered by challenges in dust storm identification. This study assesses the potential link between dust storms and cardiorespiratory emergency department (ED) visits in the southwestern US. We acquired data for 2005-2016 from eight IMPROVE (Interagency Monitoring of PROtected Visual Environments) sites in Arizona, California, and Utah. We applied a validated algorithm to identify dust storm days at each site. We acquired patient-level ED visit data from state agencies and ascertained visits for respiratory, cardiovascular, and cause-specific subgroups among patients residing in ZIP codes within 50 km of an IMPROVE site. Using a case-crossover design, we estimated short-term associations of ED visits and dust storms, controlling for temporally varying covariates. During 2005-2016, 40 dust storm days occurred at the eight IMPROVE sites. Mean PM10 and PM2.5 levels were three to six times greater on dust storm days compared to non-dust storm days. Over the study period, there were 2 524 259 respiratory and 2 805 925 cardiovascular ED visits. At lags of 1, 2, and 3 days after a dust storm, we observed 3.7% (95% CI: 1.0%, 7.6%), 4.9% (95% CI: 1.1%, 8.9%), and 5.0% (95% CI: 1.3%, 8.9%) elevated odds of respiratory ED visits compared to non-dust storm days. Estimated associations of dust storm days and cardiovascular disease ED visits were largely consistent with the null. Using a monitoring-based exposure metric, we observed associations among dust storms and respiratory ED visits. The results add to growing evidence of the health threat posed by dust storms. The dust storm metric was limited by lack of daily data; future research should consider information from satellite and numerical models to enhance dust storm characterization.","1761":"Understanding rhino movement behavior, especially their recursive movements, holds significant promise for enhancing rhino conservation efforts, and protecting their habitats and the biodiversity they support. Here we investigate the daily, biweekly, and seasonal recursion behavior of rhinos, to aid conservation applications and increase our foundational knowledge about these important ecosystem engineers.Twenty four-hour displacements at dawn were frequently smaller than 24-h displacements at dusk or at midday and midnight resting periods. Recursion analyses demonstrated that short-term recursion was most common in areas of median rather than maximum NDVI values. Investigated across a full year, recursion analysis showed rhinos most frequently returned to areas within 8-21 days, though visits were also seen separated by months likely suggesting seasonality in range use.Using relocation data from 59 rhinos across northern Namibia and 8 years of sampling efforts, we investigated patterns in 24-h displacement at dawn, dusk, midday, and midnight to examine movement behaviors at an intermediate scale and across daily behavioral modes of foraging and resting. To understand recursion patterns across animals' short and long-term ranges, we built T-LoCoH time use grids to estimate recursive movement by each individual. Comparing these grids to contemporaneous MODIS imagery, we investigated productivity's influence on short-term space use and recursion. Finally, we investigated patterns of recursion within a year's home range, measuring the time to return to the most intensively used patches.Our results indicate that rhinos may frequently stay within the same area of their home ranges for days at a time, and possibly return to the same general area days in a row especially during morning foraging bouts. Recursion across larger time scales is also evident, and likely a contributing mechanism for maintaining open landscapes and browsing lawns of the savanna.","1762":"The clinical benefit associated with anti-amyloid immunotherapies, a new class of drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, is predicated on their ability to modify disease course by lowering brain amyloid levels. At the time of writing, two amyloid-lowering antibodies, aducanumab and lecanemab, have obtained United States Food and Drug Administration accelerated approval, with further agents of this class in the Alzheimer's disease treatment pipeline. Based on limited published clinical trial data to date, regulators, payors and physicians will need to assess their efficacy, clinical effectiveness and safety, as well as cost and accessibility. We propose that attention to three important questions related to treatment efficacy, clinical effectiveness and safety should guide evidence-based consideration of this important class of drugs. These are: (1) Were trial statistical analyses appropriate and did they convincingly support claims of efficacy? (2) Do reported treatment effects outweigh safety concerns and are they generalizable to a representative clinical population of people with Alzheimer's disease? and (3) Do the data convincingly demonstrate disease course modification, suggesting that increasing clinical benefits beyond the duration of the trials are likely? We suggest specific approaches to interpreting trial results for these drugs and highlight important areas of uncertainty where additional data and a cautious interpretation of existing results is warranted. Safe, effective and accessible treatments for Alzheimer's disease are eagerly awaited by millions of patients and their caregivers worldwide. While amyloid-targeting immunotherapies may be promising disease-modifying Alzheimer's disease treatments, rigorous and unbiased assessment of clinical trial data is critical to regulatory decision-making and subsequently determining their provision and utility in routine clinical practice. Our recommendations provide a framework for evidence-based appraisal of these drugs by regulators, payors, physicians and patients.","1763":"Typhoid fever remains an important public health problem in low- and middle-income countries, with large outbreaks reported from Africa and Asia. Although the WHO recommends typhoid vaccination for control of confirmed outbreaks, there are limited data on the epidemiologic characteristics of outbreaks to inform vaccine use in outbreak settings. We conducted a literature review for typhoid outbreaks published since 1990. We found 47 publications describing 45,215 cases in outbreaks occurring in 25 countries from 1989 through 2018. Outbreak characteristics varied considerably by WHO region, with median outbreak size ranging from 12 to 1,101 cases, median duration from 23 to 140 days, and median case fatality ratio from 0% to 1%. The largest number of outbreaks occurred in WHO Southeast Asia, 13 (28%), and African regions, 12 (26%). Among 43 outbreaks reporting a mode of disease transmission, 24 (56%) were waterborne, 17 (40%) were foodborne, and two (5%) were by direct contact transmission. Among the 34 outbreaks with antimicrobial resistance data, 11 (32%) reported Typhi non-susceptible to ciprofloxacin, 16 (47%) reported multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, and one reported extensively drug-resistant strains. Our review showed a longer median duration of outbreaks caused by MDR strains (148 days versus 34 days for susceptible strains), although this difference was not statistically significant. Control strategies focused on water, sanitation, and food safety, with vaccine use described in only six (13%) outbreaks. As typhoid conjugate vaccines become more widely used, their potential role and impact in outbreak control warrant further evaluation.","1764":"Pathogen traits can vary greatly and heavily impact the ability of a pathogen to persist in a population. Although this variation is fundamental to disease ecology, little is known about the evolutionary pressures that drive these differences, particularly where they interact with host behaviour. We hypothesized that host behaviours relevant to different transmission routes give rise to differences in contact network structure, constraining the space over which pathogen traits can evolve to maximize fitness. Our analysis of 232 contact networks across mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, arthropods, fish and molluscs found that contact network topology varies by contact type, most notably in networks that are representative of fluid-exchange transmission. Using infectious disease model simulations, we showed that these differences in network structure suggest pathogens transmitted through fluid-exchange contact types will need traits associated with high transmissibility to successfully proliferate, compared to pathogens that transmit through other types of contact. These findings were supported through a review of known traits of pathogens that transmit in humans. Our work demonstrates that contact network structure may drive the evolution of compensatory pathogen traits according to transmission strategy, providing essential context for understanding pathogen evolution and ecology.","1765":" < 0.01). We estimated the mean reproduction number was 1.72 (95% CrI, 1.60-1.85) for the omicron variant during the first local outbreak. Strict adherence to public health measures, particularly in children, should be in place to reduce the transmission risk of the highly transmissible omicron variant in the community.","1766":"Given a contact network and coarse-grained diagnostic information like electronic Healthcare Reimbursement Claims (eHRC) data, can we develop efficient intervention policies to control an epidemic? Immunization is an important problem in multiple areas especially epidemiology and public health. However, most existing studies focus on developing pre-emptive strategies assuming prior epidemiological models. In practice, disease spread is usually complicated, hence assuming an underlying model may deviate from true spreading patterns, leading to possibly inaccurate interventions. Additionally, the abundance of health care surveillance data (like eHRC) makes it possible to study data-driven strategies without too many restrictive assumptions. Hence, such an approach can help public-health experts take more practical decisions. In this paper, we take into account propagation log and contact networks for controlling propagation. We formulate the novel and challenging Data-Driven Immunization problem without assuming classical epidemiological models. To solve it, we first propose an efficient sampling approach to align surveillance data with contact networks, then develop an efficient algorithm with the provably approximate guarantee for immunization. Finally, we show the effectiveness and scalability of our methods via extensive experiments on multiple datasets, and conduct case studies on nation-wide real medical surveillance data.","1767":"Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis is a rare systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by the infiltration of histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells into multiple systems. The definitive diagnosis depends on biopsy of the affected tissues. Here, we report the F-FDG PET\/CT findings of a 62-year-old man with multicentric reticulohistiocytosis. Increased FDG uptake was observed in cutaneomucosal papules, surrounding tissues of many joints, multiple muscles, and lymph nodes. ","1768":"With pandemic exposure, C difficile (adjusted RR\u00a0=\u00a00.90 [95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86, 0.94]) and MRSA pneumonia (adjusted RR\u00a0=\u00a00.97 [95% CI 0.91, 1.05]) decreased, while MRSA septicemia (adjusted RR\u00a0=\u00a01.13 [95% CI 1.07, 1.19]) increased. Effect measure modification was not detected. C difficile or MRSA coinfection nearly doubled mean costs among COVID-19 admissions.Despite decreases in C difficile and most MRSA infections, the early COVID-19 pandemic period saw continued increases in MRSA septicemia admissions in North Carolina. Equitable interventions to curb increases and reduce health care costs should be developed.During the COVID-19 pandemic, increased antibiotic prescribing and infection prevention challenges coincided with antibiotic-resistant (AR) infection increases. Clostridioides difficile (C difficile) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are serious, costly AR threats. Health inequities in pandemic-era AR infections are not well-characterized.North Carolina statewide inpatient admissions were used to determine monthly admission rates and admission rate ratios (RRs) for C difficile and MRSA infections comparing 2017-2019 (prepandemic) to 2020 (pandemic exposure) using mixed-model Poisson regression adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, and COVID-19. We assessed effect measure modification by admissions' community-level income, county rurality, and race and ethnicity. Mean total costs by infection type were compared.","1769":"This work aims at providing a parametric solution of LCM processes, and in particular RTM, when the location of the injection gate is assumed being a model parameter. It is well known that parameters can be easily considered as model extra- coordinates within the Proper Generalized decomposition framework. Then, the use of separated representations allows efficiently circumventing the curse of dimensionality, and then calculating very efficiently the so-called computational vademecums that contain all the solutions of the problem at hand for any choice of the material, process or geometrical parameters. However, even if the construction of such parametric solutions within the PGD rationale is nowadays in most of cases mature, using both intrusive or non-intrusive approaches, the last approach induces spurious solutions when interpolating solutions exhibiting localization. The present paper shows a parametric geometric approach for RTM processes where the injection gate is a parameter. For that purpose an interpolative mapping will be successfully proposed and employed.","1770":"All items of the Malay-CAFU had satisfactory item-level CVI (I-CVI), with values greater than 0.80, and the scale-level CVI (S-CVI) was 0.95. These results indicate that the Malay-CAFU had good relevancy. The internal consistency for the reliability test showed a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.95 for the overall score. The eigenvalues and scree plot supported a two-factor structural model of the instrument. From the explanatory factor analysis, the factor loadings ranged from 0.82 to 0.90 and 0.56 to 0.83, respectively.Post-stroke complications affect the informal caregivers equally as the stroke survivors, especially those who have a moderate to worst prognosis in functional capacity recovery. Caregiver Assessment of Function and Upset (CAFU) is one of the common tools used in both research and clinical practice to measure the patient's dependency level and the stroke caregivers' upset level.This study aimed to translate and validate the CAFU instrument into the Malay language and test the validity and reliability of the CAFU among informal\u00a0stroke caregivers in Malaysia.A standard forward-backward translation method was employed to translate CAFU. Subsequently, 10 expert panels were included in the validation process, and thereafter reliability testing was conducted among 51 stroke caregivers. The validation of the instrument was determined by computing the content validity indices (CVIs), and we used the Cronbach's alpha method to explore the internal consistency of the overall score and subscales scores of the Malay-CAFU. Finally, the explanatory factor analysis used principal component extraction and a varimax rotation to examine construct validity.The Malay-CAFU questionnaire is a valid and reliable instrument to assess the dependence level of stroke survivors and the upset level of informal\u00a0stroke caregivers in Malaysia.","1771":"Anthropogenic disturbance impacts the phylogenetic composition and diversity of ecological communities. While changes in diversity are known to dramatically change species interactions and alter disease dynamics, the effects of phylogenetic changes in host and vector communities on disease have been relatively poorly studied. Using a theoretical model, we investigated how phylogeny and extinction influence network structural characteristics relevant to disease transmission in disturbed environments. We modelled a multi-host, multi-vector community as a bipartite ecological network, where nodes represent host and vector species and edges represent connections among them through vector feeding, and we simulated vector preferences and threat status on host and parasite phylogenies. We then simulated loss of hosts, including phylogenetically clustered losses, to investigate how extinction influences network structure. We compared effects of phylogeny and extinction to those of host specificity, which we predicted to strongly increase network modularity and reduce disease prevalence. The simulations revealed that extinction often increased modularity, with higher modularity as species loss increased, although not as much as increasing host specificity did. These results suggest that extinction itself, all else being equal, may reduce disease prevalence in disturbed communities. However, in real communities, systematic patterns in species loss (e.g. favoring high competence species) or changes in abundance may counteract these effects. Unexpectedly, we found that effects of phylogenetic signal in host and vector traits were relatively weak, and only important when phylogenetic signal of host and vector traits were similar, or when these traits both varied.","1772":"Perfluorocarbon emulsions (PFCs) are intravenous artificial oxygen carriers with enhanced gas solubility. As lipid micelle nanoparticle emulsions, PFCs may have a class effect that causes degrees of thrombocytopenia. Understanding the extent of the platelet effects, including mechanism and potential inflammation after PFC infusion, is important for safe human trials.In these inflammatory cell lines, there were no consistent changes or cellular activation after PFC infusion. A decrease (<10% from baseline and naive controls) in platelet count was seen on day 4 after Oxygent infusion (3 g\/kg), which recovered by day 7. No platelet effect was seen in Perftoran (1 g\/kg). Plateletcrit, mean platelet volume, and platelet distribution width did not change significantly at any time point among the groups. CD-62p, ADP, and collagen aggregometry showed no significant change in platelet function.Normal sheep (Dorper) were infused with 5 mL\/kg of Oxygent (w\/v 60% PFC) or Perftoran (w\/v 20% PFC). Controls received 6% Hetastarch or were naive. Blood samples were analyzed from baseline, time 0 (the end of infusion), 3 and 24 hours, and 4 and 7 days. Platelet count, plateletcrit, mean platelet volume, platelet distribution width, and CD-62p (a platelet activation-dependent membrane protein) were measured. Neutrophils, monocytes, and total white blood cell counts were analyzed.There was no evidence of overall reduction in platelet number, or any correlation with the change in platelet activation or inhibition. Therefore, the risk of increased thrombosis\/bleeding after PFC intravenous infusion is low in this non-trauma sheep model.","1773":"Breast cancer has an average 10-year relative survival reaching 84%. This favorable survival is due, in part, to the introduction of biomarker-guided therapies. We estimated the population-level effect of the introduction of two adjuvant therapies-tamoxifen and trastuzumab-on recurrence using the trend-in-trend pharmacoepidemiologic study design.For the population-level effect of the introduction of tamoxifen among premenopausal women diagnosed with ER-positive breast cancer in 1999, the risk of recurrence decreased by nearly one-half (OR = 0.52), consistent with evidence from clinical trials; however, the estimate was imprecise (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.25, 1.85). We observed an imprecise association between tamoxifen use and recurrence from the time it was introduced in 1982 (OR = 1.24 95% CI = 0.46, 5.11), inconsistent with prior knowledge from clinical trials. For the introduction of trastuzumab in 2007, the estimate was also consistent with trial evidence, though imprecise (OR = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.21, 22.4).We demonstrated how novel pharmacoepidemiologic analytic designs can be used to evaluate the routine clinical care and effectiveness of therapeutic advancements in a population-based setting while considering some limitations of the approach.We ascertained data on women diagnosed with nonmetastatic breast cancer who were registered in the Danish Breast Cancer Group clinical database. We used the trend-in-trend design to estimate the population-level effect of the introduction of (1) tamoxifen for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer in 1982, (2) tamoxifen for premenopausal women diagnosed with ER-positive breast cancer in 1999, and (3) trastuzumab for women <60 years diagnosed with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer in 2007.","1774":"Antimalarial resistance surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa is often constrained by logistical and financial challenges limiting its breadth and frequency. At two sites in Ghana, we have piloted a streamlined sample pooling process created immediately by sequential addition of positive malaria cases at the time of diagnostic testing. This streamlined process involving a single tube minimized clinical and laboratory work and provided accurate frequencies of all known drug resistance mutations after high-throughput targeted sequencing using molecular inversion probes. Our study validates this method as a cost-efficient, accurate and highly-scalable approach for drug resistance mutation monitoring that can potentially be applied to other infectious diseases such as tuberculosis.","1775":"The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Special Foundation of Science and Technology Innovation Strategy of Guangdong Province, and Key Project of Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission.We did a cohort study in Shenzhen, China and attempted to recruit by telephone all RT-PCR-negative close contacts (defined as those who lived in the same residence as, or shared a meal, travelled, or socially interacted with, an index case within 2 days before symptom onset) of all RT-PCR-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 detected since January, 2020, via contact tracing. We measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum samples from RT-PCR-negative close contacts 2-15 weeks after initial virological testing by RT-PCR, using total antibody, IgG, and IgM ELISAs. In addition, we did a serosurvey of volunteers from neighbourhoods with no reported cases, and from neighbourhoods with reported cases. We assessed rates of infection undetected by RT-PCR, performance of RT-PCR over the course of infection, and characteristics of individuals who were seropositive on total antibody ELISA but RT-PCR negative.Between April 12 and May 4, 2020, we enrolled and collected serological samples from 2345 (53\u00b70%) of 4422 RT-PCR-negative close contacts of cases of RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2. 1175 (50\u00b71%) of 2345 were close contacts of cases diagnosed in Shenzhen with contact tracing details, and of these, 880 (74\u00b79%) had serum samples collected more than 2 weeks after exposure to an index case and were included in our analysis. 40 (4\u00b75%) of 880 RT-PCR-negative close contacts were positive on total antibody ELISA. The seropositivity rate with total antibody ELISA among RT-PCR-negative close contacts, adjusted for assay performance, was 4\u00b71% (95% CI 2\u00b79-5\u00b77), which was significantly higher than among individuals residing in neighbourhoods with no reported cases (0\u00b70% [95% CI 0\u00b70-1\u00b71]). RT-PCR-positive individuals were 8\u00b70 times (95% CI 5\u00b73-12\u00b77) more likely to report symptoms than those who were RT-PCR-negative but seropositive, but both groups had a similar distribution of sex, age, contact frequency, and mode of contact. RT-PCR did not detect 48 (36% [95% CI 28-44]) of 134 infected close contacts, and false-negative rates appeared to be associated with stage of infection.Virological detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through RT-PCR has limitations for surveillance. Serological tests can be an important complementary approach. We aimed to assess the practical performance of RT-PCR-based surveillance protocols and determine the extent of undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection in Shenzhen, China.Even rigorous RT-PCR testing protocols might miss a substantial proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections, perhaps in part due to difficulties in determining the timing of testing in asymptomatic individuals for optimal sensitivity. RT-PCR-based surveillance and control protocols that include rapid contact tracing, universal RT-PCR testing, and mandatory 2-week quarantine were, nevertheless, able to contain community spread in Shenzhen, China.","1776":"Measuring the overlap between two populations is, in principle, straightforward. Upon fully sampling both populations, the number of shared objects-species, taxonomical units, or gene variants, depending on the context-can be directly counted. In practice, however, only a fraction of each population's objects are likely to be sampled due to stochastic data collection or sequencing techniques. Although methods exists for quantifying population overlap under subsampled conditions, their bias is well documented and the uncertainty of their estimates cannot be quantified. Here we derive and validate a method to rigorously estimate the population overlap from incomplete samples when the total number of objects, species, or genes in each population is known, a special case of the more general \u03b2-diversity problem that is particularly relevant in the ecology and genomic epidemiology of malaria. By solving a Bayesian inference problem, this method takes into account the rates of subsampling and produces unbiased and Bayes-optimal estimates of overlap. In addition, it provides a natural framework for computing the uncertainty of its estimates, and can be used prospectively in study planning by quantifying the tradeoff between sampling effort and uncertainty.","1777":"Test positive rates of all respiratory viruses decreased during 2020, compared to the average levels during 2012-2019, with changes ranging from -17\u00b72% for RSV to -87\u00b76% for IFV. Sharp decreases mostly occurred between February and August when massive NPIs remained active, although HRV rebounded to the historical level during the summer. While IFV and HMPV were consistently suppressed year round, RSV, HPIV, HCoV, HRV HBov resurged and went beyond historical levels during September, 2020-January, 2021, after NPIs were largely relaxed and schools reopened. Resurgence was more prominent among children younger than 18 years and in Northern China. These observations remain valid after accounting for seasonality and long-term trend of each virus.Etiologically diagnostic data from 142 559 cases with ARIs, who were tested for eight viral pathogens (influenza virus, IFV; respiratory syncytial virus, RSV; human parainfluenza virus, HPIV; human adenovirus; human metapneumovirus; human coronavirus, HCoV; human bocavirus, HBoV, and human rhinovirus, HRV) between 2012 and 2021, were analyzed to assess the changes of respiratory infections in China during the first COVID-19 pandemic year compared to pre-pandemic years.To combat the COVID-19 pandemic, nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) were implemented worldwide, which impacted a broad spectrum of acute respiratory infections (ARI).Activities of respiratory viral infections were reduced substantially in the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, and massive NPIs were likely the main driver. Lifting of NPIs can lead to resurgence of viral infections, particularly in children.","1778":"Two nonrandomized open-trial pilot studies were conducted with a total of 74 young adults (age 25.4 \u00b1 6.6 years; 55% female).

Study 2: Improvements in self-reported emotion regulation were observed at 1-month follow-up relative to baseline (P = 0.019). Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-Expanded Form positive affect increased (P = 0.021), while fatigue and sadness decreased (P's \u2264 0.005). During the stationary cycling challenge, rate to recovery of electrocardiography inter-beat interval also increased from baseline to 1-month follow-up (P = 0.077).While efficacy of Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) has been demonstrated in a number of prior studies, little is known about the effects of SKY taught as part of the Your Enlightened Side (YES+) workshop designed for college students and other young adults.This study aimed to assess the effects of YES+, a yogic breathing-based life skills workshop, on multiple measures of well-being and physiological stress response.These findings suggest that a life skills workshop integrating yogic breathing techniques may provide self-empowering tools for enhancing well-being in young adults. Future research is indicated to further explore these effects, particularly in regards to vagal tone and other aspects of stress physiology.","1779":"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as a global threat in December 2019. As the epidemic progresses, disease modellers continue to focus on estimating the basic reproductive number [Formula: see text]-the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case in an otherwise susceptible population. The modelling approaches and resulting estimates of [Formula: see text] during the beginning of the outbreak vary widely, despite relying on similar data sources. Here, we present a statistical framework for comparing and combining different estimates of [Formula: see text] across a wide range of models by decomposing the basic reproductive number into three key quantities: the exponential growth rate, the mean generation interval and the generation-interval dispersion. We apply our framework to early estimates of [Formula: see text] for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, showing that many [Formula: see text] estimates are overly confident. Our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all components of [Formula: see text], including the shape of the generation-interval distribution, in efforts to estimate [Formula: see text] at the outset of an epidemic.","1780":"Patients with severe (N = 101) or acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria (N = 83) were recruited from 2 hospitals in India and Bangladesh, and healthy participants (N = 44) underwent echocardiography.Impaired microvascular perfusion is central to the development of coma and lactic acidosis in severe falciparum malaria. Refractory hypotension is rare on admission but develops frequently in fatal cases. We assessed cardiac function and volume status in severe falciparum malaria and its prognostic significance.Patients with severe malaria have rapid ejection of a normal stroke volume. Fatal cases had features of relative hypovolemia and reduced cardiac index reserve.Patients with severe malaria had 38% shorter left ventricular (LV) filling times and 25% shorter LV ejection times than healthy participants because of tachycardia; however, stroke volume, LV internal diameter in diastole (LVIDd), and LV internal diameter in systole (LVIDs) indices were similar. A low endocardial fraction shortening (eFS) was present in 17% (9 of 52) of severe malaria patients. Adjusting for preload and afterload, eFS was similar in health and severe malaria. Fatal cases had smaller baseline LVIDd and LVIDs indices, more collapsible inferior vena cavae (IVC), and higher heart rates than survivors. The LVIDs and IVC collapsibility were independent predictors for mortality, together with base excess and Glasgow Coma Scale.","1781":"We studied the immunogenicity of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in health-care workers of a major infectious diseases hospital in Vietnam. We measured neutralizing antibodies before and 14 days after each dose, and at day 28 and month 3 after dose 1. A total of 554 workers (136 men and 418 women; age range, 22-71 years; median age, 36 years) participated with the study. Of the 144 participants selected for follow-up after dose 1, 104 and 94 gave blood for antibody measurement at weeks 6 and 8, and at month 3 after dose 1, respectively. The window time between the two doses was 6 weeks. At baseline, none had detectable neutralizing antibodies. After dose 1, the proportion of participants with detectable neutralizing antibodies increased from 27.3% (151 of 554) at day 14 to 78.0% (432 of 554) at day 28. Age correlated negatively with the development and the levels of neutralizing antibodies. However, at day 28, these differences were less profound, and women had a greater seroconversion rate and greater levels of neutralizing antibodies than men. After dose 2, these age and gender associations were not observable. In addition, the proportion of study participants with detectable neutralizing antibodies increased from 70.2% (73 of 104) before dose 2 (week 6, after dose 1) to 98.1% (102 of 104) 14 days later. At month 3, neutralizing antibodies decreased and 94.7% (89 of 94) of the study participants remained seropositive. The Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is immunogenic in Vietnamese health-care workers. These data are critical to informing the deployment of the COVID-19 vaccine in Vietnam and in Southeast Asia, where vaccination coverage remains inadequate.","1782":"In children younger than 2 years of age with acute otitis media and no recent antibiotic exposure, immediate amoxicillin seems to be the most cost-effective initial treatment.We compared the cost per quality-adjusted life-day of 5 treatment regimens in children younger than 2 years of age with acute otitis media: immediate amoxicillin\/clavulanate, immediate amoxicillin, immediate cefdinir, watchful waiting, and delayed prescription (DP) for antibiotic.The 5 treatment regimens, listed in order from least effective to most effective were DP, watchful waiting, immediate cefdinir, immediate amoxicillin, and immediate amoxicillin\/clavulanate. Listed in order from least costly to most costly, the regimens were DP, immediate amoxicillin, watchful waiting, immediate amoxicillin\/clavulanate, and immediate cefdinir. The incremental cost-utility ratio of immediate amoxicillin compared with DP was $101.07 per quality-adjusted life-day gained. The incremental cost-utility ratio of immediate amoxicillin\/clavulanate compared with amoxicillin was $2331.28 per quality-adjusted life-day gained.To assess whether antimicrobial therapy in young children with acute otitis media reduces time to resolution of symptoms, overall symptom burden, and persistence of otoscopic evidence of infection. We used a cost-utility model to evaluate whether immediate antimicrobial treatment seems to be worthwhile, and if so, which antimicrobial agent is most cost effective.","1783":"Lassa fever (LF) is a zoonotic disease that is widespread in West Africa and involves animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission. Animal-to-human transmission occurs upon exposure to rodent excreta and secretions, i.e. urine and saliva, and human-to-human transmission occurs via the bodily fluids of an infected person. To elucidate the seasonal drivers of LF epidemics, we employed a mathematical model to analyse the datasets of human infection, rodent population dynamics and climatological variations and capture the underlying transmission dynamics. The surveillance-based incidence data of human cases in Nigeria were explored, and moreover, a mathematical model was used for describing the transmission dynamics of LF in rodent populations. While quantifying the case fatality risk and the rate of exposure of humans to animals, we explicitly estimated the corresponding contact rate of humans with infected rodents, accounting for the seasonal population dynamics of rodents. Our findings reveal that seasonal migratory dynamics of rodents play a key role in regulating the cyclical pattern of LF epidemics. The estimated timing of high exposure of humans to animals coincides with the time shortly after the start of the dry season and can be associated with the breeding season of rodents in Nigeria. This article is part of the theme issue 'Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: approaches and important themes'. This issue is linked with the subsequent theme issue 'Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: epidemic forecasting and control'.","1784":", even at intermediate efficacy (50% transmission reduction), might reduce global annual disease incidence by up to 90%. The Sanofi-Pasteur vaccine, targeting only seropositive recipients, might reduce global annual disease incidence by 20 to 30%, with the greatest impact in high-transmission settings. The transmission intensity map presented here, and made available for download, may help further assessment of the impact of dengue control interventions and prioritization of global public health efforts.","1785":"Compared to the current situation, there was a net total monetised benefit of 9.18 M\u20ac and 9.10 M\u20ac for scenarios one and two, respectively. Disability Adjusted Life Years were 12,805-12,980 years lower than the current situation. This resulted in a benefit-cost ratio of 1.52 and 1.43 for scenarios one and two, respectively.Cost-benefit analysis was conducted to analyse three scenarios: (1) current situation: 20% uptake rate of cardiac rehabilitation; (2) alternative scenario one: 40% uptake rate of cardiac rehabilitation; and (3) alternative scenario two: 20% uptake of cardiac rehabilitation and 20% uptake of both cardiac rehabilitation and telerehabilitation. Impacts considered included cardiac (tele)rehabilitation programme costs, direct inpatient costs, productivity losses and burden of disease.Cardiac rehabilitation for ischaemic heart disease effectively reduces cardiovascular readmission rate and mortality. Current uptake rates however, remain low. This study assesses the social and economic impact of increasing centre-based cardiac rehabilitation uptake and the additional value of cardiac telerehabilitation using cost-benefit analysis (CBA) in Belgium.Increased cardiac rehabilitation uptake rates can reduce the burden of disease, and the resulting benefits exceed its costs. This research supports the necessity for greater promotion and routine referral to cardiac rehabilitation to be made standard practice. The implementation of telerehabilitation as an adjunct is to be encouraged, especially for those patients unable to attend centre-based cardiac rehabilitation.","1786":"The genus Xanthomonas has been primarily studied for pathogenic interactions with plants. However, besides host and tissue-specific pathogenic strains, this genus also comprises nonpathogenic strains isolated from a broad range of hosts, sometimes in association with pathogenic strains, and other environments, including rainwater. Based on their incapacity or limited capacity to cause symptoms on the host of isolation, nonpathogenic xanthomonads can be further characterized as commensal and weakly pathogenic. This study aimed to understand the diversity and evolution of nonpathogenic xanthomonads compared to their pathogenic counterparts based on their cooccurrence and phylogenetic relationship and to identify genomic traits that form the basis of a life history framework that groups xanthomonads by ecological strategies. We sequenced genomes of 83 strains spanning the genus phylogeny and identified eight novel species, indicating unexplored diversity. While some nonpathogenic species have experienced a recent loss of a type III secretion system, specifically the hrp2 cluster, we observed an apparent lack of association of the hrp2 cluster with lifestyles of diverse species. We performed association analysis on a large data set of 337 Xanthomonas strains to explain how xanthomonads may have established association with the plants across the continuum of lifestyles from commensals to weak pathogens to pathogens. Presence of distinct transcriptional regulators, distinct nutrient utilization and assimilation genes, transcriptional regulators, and chemotaxis genes may explain lifestyle-specific adaptations of xanthomonads.","1787":"The COVID-19 pandemic galvanized the field of virus genomic surveillance, demonstrating its utility for public health. Now, we must harness the momentum that led to increased infrastructure, training, and political will to build a sustainable global genomic surveillance network for other epidemic and endemic viruses. We suggest a generalizable modular sequencing framework wherein users can easily switch between virus targets to maximize cost-effectiveness and maintain readiness for new threats. We also highlight challenges associated with genomic surveillance and when global inequalities persist. We propose solutions to mitigate some of these issues, including training and multilateral partnerships. Exploring alternatives to clinical sequencing can also reduce the cost of surveillance programs. Finally, we discuss how establishing genomic surveillance would aid control programs and potentially provide a warning system for outbreaks, using a global respiratory virus (RSV), an arbovirus (dengue virus), and a regional zoonotic virus (Lassa virus) as examples.","1788":"Our results highlight the risk of widespread outbreaks in mainland China, particularly under the heightened pressure of imported infections. The targeted interventions adopted in March 2022 were not capable of halting transmission, and the implementation of a strict, prolonged city-wide lockdown was needed to successfully contain the outbreak, highlighting the challenges for containing Omicron outbreaks.Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82130093); Shanghai Rising-Star Program (22QA1402300).A surge in imported infections in Phase 1 triggered cryptic local transmission of the Omicron variant in early March, resulting in the largest outbreak in mainland China since the original wave. A total of 626,000 SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported in 99.5% (215\/216) of the subdistricts of Shanghai until the end of May. The spatial distribution of the infections was highly heterogeneous, with 37% of the subdistricts accounting for 80% of all infections. A clear trend from the city center towards adjacent suburban and rural areas was observed, with a progressive slowdown of the epidemic spread (from 463 to 244 meters\/day) prior to the citywide lockdown. During Phase 2, Rt remained well above 1 despite the implementation of multiple targeted interventions. The citywide lockdown imposed on April 1 led to a marked decrease in transmission, bringing Rt below the epidemic threshold in the entire city on April 14 and ultimately leading to containment of the outbreak.In early March 2022, a major outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant spread rapidly throughout Shanghai, China. Here we aimed to provide a description of the epidemiological characteristics and spatiotemporal transmission dynamics of the Omicron outbreak under the population-based screening and lockdown policies implemented in Shanghai.We extracted individual information on SARS-CoV-2 infections reported between January 1 and May 31, 2022, and on the timeline of the adopted non-pharmaceutical interventions. The epidemic was divided into three phases: i) sporadic infections (January 1-February 28), ii) local transmission (March 1-March 31), and iii) city-wide lockdown (April 1 to May 31). We described the epidemic spread during these three phases and the subdistrict-level spatiotemporal distribution of the infections. To evaluate the impact on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 of the adopted targeted interventions in Phase 2 and city-wide lockdown in Phase 3, we estimated the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt ).","1789":"The KRAB-containing zinc finger (KRAB-ZF) proteins represent the largest family of transcription factors (TFs) in humans, yet for the great majority, their function and specific genomic target remain unknown. However, it has been shown that a large fraction of these genes arose from segmental duplications, and that they have expanded in gene and zinc finger number throughout vertebrate evolution. To determine whether this expansion is linked to selective pressures acting on different domains, we have manually curated all KRAB-ZF genes present in the human genome together with their orthologous genes in three closely related species and assessed the evolutionary forces acting at the sequence level as well as on their expression profiles. We provide evidence that KRAB-ZFs can be separated into two categories according to the polymorphism present in their DNA-contacting residues. Those carrying a nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in their DNA-contacting amino acids exhibit significantly reduced expression in all tissues, have emerged in a recent lineage, and seem to be less strongly constrained evolutionarily than those without such a polymorphism. This work provides evidence for a link between age of the TF, as well as polymorphism in their DNA-contacting residues and expression levels-both of which may be jointly affected by selection. ","1790":"The Flint Water Crisis (FWC) was an avoidable public health disaster that has profoundly affected the city's residents, a majority of whom are Black. Although many scholars and journalists have called attention to the role of racism in the water crisis, little is known about the extent to which the public attributed the FWC to racism as it was unfolding. In this study, we used natural language processing to analyze nearly six million Flint-related tweets posted between April 1, 2014, and June 1, 2016. We found that key developments in the FWC corresponded to increases in the number and percentage of tweets that mentioned terms related to race and racism. Similar patterns were found for other topics hypothesized to be related to the water crisis, including water and politics. Using sentiment analysis, we found that tweets with a negative polarity score were more common in the subset of tweets that mentioned terms related to race and racism when compared to the full set of tweets. Next, we found that word pairs that included terms related to race and racism first appeared after the January 2016 state and federal emergency declarations and a corresponding increase in media coverage of the FWC. We conclude that many Twitter users connected the events of the water crisis to race and racism in real-time. Given growing evidence of negative health effects of second-hand exposure to racism, this may have implications for understanding minority health and health disparities in the US.","1791":"clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02342860).","1792":" parasites transmitted through the bite of female Anopheles mosquito. Microscopists commonly examine thick and thin blood smears to diagnose disease and compute parasitemia. However, their accuracy depends on smear quality and expertise in classifying and counting parasitized and uninfected cells. Such an examination could be arduous for large-scale diagnoses resulting in poor quality. State-of-the-art image-analysis based computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) methods using machine learning (ML) techniques, applied to microscopic images of the smears using hand-engineered features demand expertise in analyzing morphological, textural, and positional variations of the region of interest (ROI). In contrast, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a class of deep learning (DL) models promise highly scalable and superior results with end-to-end feature extraction and classification. Automated malaria screening using DL techniques could, therefore, serve as an effective diagnostic aid. In this study, we evaluate the performance of pre-trained CNN based DL models as feature extractors toward classifying parasitized and uninfected cells to aid in improved disease screening. We experimentally determine the optimal model layers for feature extraction from the underlying data. Statistical validation of the results demonstrates the use of pre-trained CNNs as a promising tool for feature extraction for this purpose.","1793":"We conducted a retrospective analysis of fatal overdoses occurring between January 1, 2016 and June 30, 2020. Using individual- and neighborhood-level data, we conducted descriptive analyses to explore the characteristics of individuals and neighborhoods most affected by overdose.To compare the characteristics of individual overdose decedents in Rhode Island, 2016-2020 to the neighborhoods where fatal overdoses occurred over the same time period.Most overdose decedents during the study period were non-Hispanic White. Across increasingly more White and non-Hispanic neighborhoods, rates of fatal overdose per 100,000 person-years decreased. An opposite pattern was observed across quintiles of average neighborhood poverty.Rates of fatal overdose were higher in less White, more Hispanic, and poorer neighborhoods, suggesting\u00a0modest divergence between the characteristics of individuals and the neighborhoods most severely affected. These impacts may not be uniform across space and may accrue differentially to more disadvantaged and racially\/ethnically diverse neighborhoods."},"journal":{"0":"Evolution; international journal of organic evolution","1":"Drug and alcohol dependence","2":"Journal not specified.","3":"Heart, lung & circulation","4":"Frontiers in medicine","5":"Digital health","6":"medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences","7":"International journal of environmental research and public health","8":"Environmental Epidemiology","9":"Neurobiology of aging","10":"The Journal of infectious diseases","11":"Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association","12":"Neurophotonics","13":"Molecular phylogenetics and evolution","14":"Journal of theoretical biology","15":"Frontiers in reproductive health","16":"Nature human behaviour","17":"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","18":"The Journal of infectious diseases","19":"The Journal of animal ecology","20":"JAMA network open","21":"Open forum infectious diseases","22":"Science advances","23":"Frontiers in public health","24":"BMC genomics","25":"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","26":"Evolutionary applications","27":"PLOS global public health","28":"Malaria Journal","29":"Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America","30":"Preventive veterinary medicine","31":"EClinicalMedicine","32":"Bioresource technology","33":"PloS one","34":"BMC public health","35":"Journal of medical systems","36":"Epidemiology and infection","37":"Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America","38":"BMC infectious diseases","39":"American journal of epidemiology","40":"International journal of molecular sciences","41":"NPJ Regenerative medicine","42":"Veterinary research","43":"BMC infectious diseases","44":"BMC public health","45":"PLoS computational biology","46":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","47":"Emerging infectious diseases","48":"Insects","49":"Trends in microbiology","50":"AIDS patient care and STDs","51":"Scientific reports","52":"Emerging infectious diseases","53":"Scientific reports","54":"mSystems","55":"Linear Algebra and its Applications","56":"bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology","57":"Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry","58":"Proceedings.
