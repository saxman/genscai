While policymakers have attempted to balance the health and economic impacts of the pandemic, decentralized decision-making, deep uncertainty, and the lack of widespread use of comprehensive decision support methods can lead to the choice of fragile or inefficient strategies. This paper uses simulation models and the Robust Decision Making (RDM) approach to stress-test California's reopening strategy and other alternatives over a wide range of futures. We find that plans which respond aggressively to initial outbreaks are required to robustly control the pandemic. Further, the best plans adapt to changing circumstances, lowering their stringent requirements to reopen over time or as more constituents are vaccinated. While we use California as an example, our results are particularly relevant for jurisdictions where vaccination roll-out has been slower.","journal":"medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences","reference":"de Lima PN, Lempert R, Vardavas R, Baker L, Ringel J, Rutter CM, Ozik J, Collier N.

To understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of EVD in West Africa, we developed spatial transmission models using a gravity-model framework at both the national and district-level scales, which we used to compare effectiveness of local interventions (e.g. local quarantine) and long-range interventions (e.g. border-closures). The country-level gravity model captures the epidemic data, including multiple waves of initial epidemic growth observed in Guinea. We found that local-transmission reductions were most effective in Liberia, while long-range transmission was dominant in Sierra Leone. Both models illustrated that interventions in one region result in an amplified protective effect on other regions by preventing spatial transmission. In the district-level model, interventions in the strongest of these amplifying regions reduced total cases in all three countries by over 20%, in spite of the region itself generating only \u223c0.1% of total cases.

A case study in 20 cities in Brazil.","abstract":"The dengue virus affects millions of people every year worldwide, causing large epidemic outbreaks that disrupt people's lives and severely strain healthcare systems. In the absence of a reliable vaccine against dengue or an effective treatment to manage the illness in humans, most efforts to combat dengue infections have focused on preventing its vectors, mainly the Aedes aegypti mosquito, from flourishing across the world. These mosquito-control strategies need reliable disease activity surveillance systems to be deployed. Despite significant efforts to estimate dengue incidence using a variety of data sources and methods, little work has been done to understand the relative contribution of the different data sources to improved prediction. Additionally, scholarship on the topic had initially focused on prediction systems at the national- and state-levels, and much remains to be done at the finer spatial resolutions at which health policy interventions often occur. We develop a methodological framework to assess and compare dengue incidence estimates at the city level, and evaluate the performance of a collection of models on 20 different cities in Brazil. The data sources we use towards this end are weekly incidence counts from prior years (seasonal autoregressive terms), weekly-aggregated weather variables, and real-time internet search data. We find that both random forest-based models and LASSO regression-based models effectively leverage these multiple data sources to produce accurate predictions, and that while the performance between them is comparable on average, the former method produces fewer extreme outliers, and can thus be considered more robust. For real-time predictions that assume long delays (6-8 weeks) in the availability of epidemiological data, we find that real-time internet search data are the strongest predictors of dengue incidence, whereas for predictions that assume short delays (1-3 weeks), in which the error rate is halved (as measured by relative RMSE), short-term and seasonal autocorrelation are the dominant predictors. Despite the difficulties inherent to city-level prediction, our framework achieves meaningful and actionable estimates across cities with different demographic, geographic and epidemic characteristics.","journal":"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","reference":"Koplewitz G, Lu F, Clemente L, Buckee C, Santillana M.

Current efforts to develop transmissible vaccines use recombinant vector technology whereby pathogen antigens are engineered to be expressed from innocuous infectious viral vectors. The resulting vaccines can transmit from host to host, amplifying the number of vaccine-protected individuals beyond those initially vaccinated directly through parenteral inoculation. One main engineering challenge is the potential for natural selection to favor vaccine mutants that eliminate or reduce expression of antigenic inserts, resulting in immunogenic decay of the vaccine over time. Here, we study a mathematical model of vector mutation whereby continuous elimination of the antigenic insert results in reversion of the vaccine back into the insert-free vector. We use this model to quantify the maximum allowable rate of reversion that can be tolerated for a transmissible vaccine to maintain a critical threshold level of immunogenicity against a target pathogen. Our results demonstrate that even for transmissible vaccines where reversion is frequent, performance will often substantially exceed that of conventional, directly administered vaccines. Further, our results demonstrate the feasibility of designing transmissible vaccines that yield desired levels of immunogenicity, yet degrade at a rate sufficient for persistence of the recombinant vaccine within the environment to be minimized.","journal":"Evolutionary applications","reference":"Nuismer SL, Basinski A, Bull JJ.

In addition to morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, the pandemic also disrupted local health systems, including reductions or delays in routine vaccination services and catch-up vaccination campaigns. These disruptions could lead to outbreaks of other infectious diseases that result in an additional burden of disease and strain on the healthcare system. We evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Zambia's routine childhood immunization program in 2020 using multiple sources of data. We relied on administrative vaccination data and Zambia's 2018 Demographic and Health Survey to project national disruptions to district-specific routine childhood vaccination coverage within the pandemic year 2020. Next, we leveraged a 2016 population-based serological survey to predict age-specific measles seroprevalence and assessed the impact of changes in vaccination coverage on measles outbreak risk in each district. We found minor disruptions to routine administration of measles-rubella and pentavalent vaccines in 2020. This was in part due to Zambia's Child Health Week held in June of 2020 which helped to reach children missed during the first six months of the year. We estimated that the two-month delay in a measles-rubella vaccination campaign, originally planned for September of 2020 but conducted in November of 2020 as a result of the pandemic, had little impact on modeled district-specific measles outbreak risks. This study estimated minimal increases in the number of children missed by vaccination services in Zambia during 2020. However, the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission since our analysis concluded means efforts to maintain routine immunization services and minimize the risk of measles outbreaks will continue to be critical.

Compartmental models, which focus on interactions and transitions between population strata, have been a mainstay of such modelling for more than a century. However, modellers are increasingly adopting agent-based approaches, which model hosts, vectors and\/or their interactions on an individual level. One reason for the increasing popularity of such models is their potential to provide enhanced realism by allowing system-level behaviours to emerge as a consequence of accumulated individual-level interactions, as occurs in real populations.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nA systematic review of 90 articles published between 1998 and May 2018 was performed, characterizing agent-based models (ABMs) relevant to malaria transmission. The review provides an overview of approaches used to date, determines the advantages of these approaches, and proposes ideas for progressing the field.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nThe rationale for ABM use over other modelling approaches centres around three points: the need to accurately represent increased stochasticity in low-transmission settings; the benefits of high-resolution spatial simulations; and heterogeneities in drug and vaccine efficacies due to individual patient characteristics. The success of these approaches provides avenues for further exploration of agent-based techniques for modelling malaria transmission. Potential extensions include varying elimination strategies across spatial landscapes, extending the size of spatial models, incorporating human movement dynamics, and developing increasingly comprehensive parameter estimation and optimization techniques.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nCollectively, the literature covers an extensive array of topics, including the full spectrum of transmission and intervention regimes. Bringing these elements together under a common framework may enhance knowledge of, and guide policies towards, malaria elimination. However, because of the diversity of available models, endorsing a standardized approach to ABM implementation may not be possible. Instead it is recommended that model frameworks be contextually appropriate and sufficiently described. One key recommendation is to develop enhanced parameter estimation and optimization techniques. Extensions of current techniques will provide the robust results required to enhance current elimination efforts.","journal":"Malaria Journal","reference":"Neal R Smith, James M Trauer, Manoj Gambhir, Jack S Richards, Richard J Maude, Jonathan M Keith, Jennifer A Flegg.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance recommends prophylaxis be initiated for all non-ill residents once an influenza outbreak is detected and be continued for at least 14 days and until seven days after the last laboratory-confirmed influenza case is identified. However, not all facilities strictly adhere to this guidance and the impact of such partial adherence is not fully understood.Prophylaxis implemented according to current guidance reduced total symptomatic illnesses and hospitalizations among residents by an average of 12% and 36%, respectively, compared with no prophylaxis. We did not find evidence that alternative implementations of prophylaxis were more effective: compared to full adoption of current guidance, partial adoption resulted in increased symptomatic illnesses and\/or hospitalizations, and longer or earlier adoption offered no additional improvements. In addition, increasing uptake and adherence among nursing home residents was effective in reducing resident illnesses and hospitalizations, but increasing HCP uptake had minimal indirect impacts for residents.The greatest benefits of influenza prophylaxis during nursing home outbreaks will likely be achieved through increasing uptake and adherence among residents and following current CDC guidance.We developed a stochastic compartmental framework to model influenza transmission within an average-sized U.S. nursing home.

Our results show that accelerating vaccine delivery would substantially reduce severe health outcomes. For a SGTF with 30% higher transmissibility, increasing vaccine doses from 1 to 3 million per day would avert 152,048 (95% CrI: 134,772-168,696) hospitalizations and 48,448 (95% CrI: 42,042-54,285) deaths over 300 days. Accelerated vaccination would also prevent additional COVID-19 waves that would otherwise be fuelled by waning adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs).We found that the current pace of vaccine rollout is insufficient to prevent the exacerbation of the pandemic that will be attributable to the novel, more contagious SARS-CoV-2 variants. Accelerating the vaccination rate should be a public health priority for averting the expected surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths that would be associated with widespread dissemination of the SGTF variants. Our results underscore the need to bolster the production and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, to rapidly expand vaccination priority groups and distribution sites.More contagious variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged around the world, sparking concerns about impending surge in cases and severe outcomes.

Recent epidemiologic evidence suggests that targeted vaccination of mothers during pregnancy can reduce pertussis incidence in their infants. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of antepartum maternal vaccination in the United States, we created an age-stratified transmission model, incorporating empirical data on US contact patterns and explicitly modeling parent-infant exposure. Antepartum maternal vaccination incurs costs of $114,000 (95% prediction interval: 82,000, 183,000) per quality-adjusted life-year, in comparison with the strategy of no adult vaccination, and is cost-effective in the United States according to World Health Organization criteria. By contrast, vaccinating a second parent is not cost-effective, and vaccination of either parent postpartum is strongly dominated by antepartum maternal vaccination. Nonetheless, postpartum vaccination of mothers who were not vaccinated antepartum improves upon the current recommendation of untargeted adult vaccination. Additionally, the temporary direct protection of the infant due to maternal antibody transfer has efficacy for infants comparable to that conferred to toddlers by the full primary vaccination series. Efficient protection against pertussis for infants begins before birth. We highly recommend antepartum vaccination for as many US mothers as possible.","journal":"American journal of epidemiology","reference":"Atkins KE, Fitzpatrick MC, Galvani AP, Townsend JP. (2016).

To do so, we used a spatially-explicit transmission model, which was calibrated to reproduce the observed spatio-temporal distribution of outbreaks in France during the 2016-2017 epidemic of HPAI. Six scenarios were investigated, in which the density of palmiped farms was decreased in the municipalities with the highest palmiped farm density. For each of the six scenarios, we first calculated the spatial distribution of the basic reproduction number (R0), i.e. the expected number of farms a particular farm would be likely to infect, should all other farms be susceptible. We also ran in silico simulations of the adjusted model for each scenario to estimate epidemic sizes and time-varying effective reproduction numbers. We showed that reducing palmiped farm density in the densest municipalities decreased substantially the size of the areas with high R0 values (>\u20091.5). In silico simulations suggested that reducing palmiped farm density, even slightly, in the densest municipalities was expected to decrease substantially the number of affected poultry farms and therefore provide benefits to the poultry sector as a whole.

Of these, 8 samples yielded sequences with at least 50% coverage. Our phylogeographic reconstruction indicates two separate introductions of ZIKV to Colombia, one of which was previously unrecognized. We find that ZIKV was first introduced to Colombia in February 2015 (95%CI: Jan 2015 - Apr 2015), corresponding to 5 to 8 months of cryptic ZIKV transmission prior to confirmation in September 2015. Despite the presence of multiple introductions, we find that the majority of Colombian ZIKV diversity descends from a single introduction. We find evidence for movement of ZIKV from Colombia into bordering countries, including Peru, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela.Colombia was the second most affected country during the American Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic, with over 109,000 reported cases. Despite the scale of the outbreak, limited genomic sequence data were available from Colombia. We sought to sequence additional samples and use genomic epidemiology to describe ZIKV dynamics in Colombia.Similarly to genomic epidemiological studies of ZIKV dynamics in other countries, we find that ZIKV circulated cryptically in Colombia. More accurately dating when ZIKV was circulating refines our definition of the population at risk. Additionally, our finding that the majority of ZIKV transmission within Colombia was attributable to transmission between individuals, rather than repeated travel-related importations, indicates that improved detection and control might have succeeded in limiting the scale of the outbreak within Colombia.We sequenced ZIKV genomes directly from clinical diagnostic specimens and infected Aedes aegypti samples selected to cover the temporal and geographic breadth of the Colombian outbreak. We performed phylogeographic analysis of these genomes, along with other publicly-available ZIKV genomes from the Americas, to estimate the frequency and timing of ZIKV introductions to Colombia.","journal":"BMC infectious diseases","reference":"Black A, Moncla LH, Laiton-Donato K, Potter B, Pardo L, Rico A, Tovar C, Rojas DP, Longini IM, Halloran ME, Pel\u00e1ez-Carvajal D, Ram\u00edrez JD, Mercado-Reyes M, Bedford T.

Both serological data and new analytical techniques used to interpret them are increasingly widespread. This creates a need for tools to simulate serological studies and the processes underlying observed titer values, as this will enable researchers to identify best practices for serological study design, and provide a standardized framework to evaluate the performance of different inference methods. serosim allows users to specify and adjust model inputs representing underlying processes responsible for generating the observed titer values like time-varying patterns of infection and vaccination, population demography, immunity and antibody kinetics, and serological sampling design in order to best represent the population and disease system(s) of interest.

In this work, we developed mathematical models for HIV\/AIDS and Tuberculosis (TB) in Brazil, one of the largest and most unequal LMICs, incorporating poverty rates and temporal dynamics to evaluate and forecast the impact of the increase in poverty due to the economic crisis, and estimate the mitigation effects of alternative poverty-reduction policies on the incidence and mortality from AIDS and TB up to 2030. Three main intervention scenarios were simulated-an economic crisis followed by the implementation of social protection policies with none, moderate, or strong coverage-evaluating the incidence and mortality from AIDS and TB. Without social protection policies to mitigate the impact of the economic crisis, the burden of HIV\/AIDS and TB would be significantly larger over the next decade, being responsible in 2030 for an incidence 13% (95% CI 4-31%) and mortality 21% (95% CI 12-34%) higher for HIV\/AIDS, and an incidence 16% (95% CI 10-25%) and mortality 22% (95% CI 15-31%) higher for TB, if compared with a scenario of moderate social protection. These differences would be significantly larger if compared with a scenario of strong social protection, resulting in more than 230,000 cases and 34,000 deaths from AIDS and TB averted over the next decade in Brazil.

Despite the progress made by introducing Wolbachia bacteria into the Aedes aegypti wild-type population to control arboviral infections, reports suggest that heat-induced loss-of-Wolbachia-infection as a result of climate change may reverse these gains. Novel, supplemental Wolbachia strains that are more resilient to increased temperatures may circumvent these concerns, and could potentially act synergistically with existing variants. In this article, we model the ecological dynamics among three distinct mosquito (sub)populations: a wild-type population free of any Wolbachia infection; an invading population infected with a particular Wolbachia strain; and a second invading population infected with a distinct Wolbachia strain from that of the first invader. We explore how the range of possible characteristics of each Wolbachia strain impacts mosquito prevalence. Further, we analyse the differential system governing the mosquito populations and the Wolbachia infection dynamics by computing the full set of basic and invasive reproduction numbers and use these to establish stability of identified equilibria. Our results show that releasing mosquitoes with two different strains of Wolbachia did not increase their prevalence, compared with a single-strain Wolbachia-infected mosquito introduction and only delayed Wolbachia dominance.","journal":"Scientific reports","reference":"Ogunlade ST, Adekunle AI, McBryde ES, Meehan MT.

Its distribution underpins estimates of the reproductive number and hence informs public health strategies. Empirical generation-interval distributions are often derived from contact-tracing data. But linking observed generation intervals to the underlying generation interval required for modelling purposes is surprisingly not straightforward, and misspecifications can lead to incorrect estimates of the reproductive number, with the potential to misguide interventions to stop or slow an epidemic. Here, we clarify the theoretical framework for three conceptually different generation-interval distributions: the 'intrinsic' one typically used in mathematical models and the 'forward' and 'backward' ones typically observed from contact-tracing data, looking, respectively, forward or backward in time. We explain how the relationship between these distributions changes as an epidemic progresses and discuss how empirical generation-interval data can be used to correctly inform mathematical models.","journal":"Proceedings.

The impact of congenital infection is well documented; however, there is increasing evidence of a much broader range of potential health outcomes and the need to improve our understanding of the transmission patterns and infection sources in the overall population. This study examined the epidemiology of toxoplasmosis in distinct community types from a highly endemic area of Chile.Crude seroprevalence was 55.9% (95% CI: 52.6-59.1%) with no difference by community type. Results are indicative of early exposure to the parasite, including 40% of 13- to 17-year olds who were already seropositive. Sociodemographic factors associated with seropositivity included age, occupations, and income. However, sex modified the effect of occupation as well as of income. Practices associated with increased seropositivity were consumption of sheep and locally produced vegetables as well as cleaning household barns or sheds. Boiling water for household use was a protective factor. Living on a sloped terrain without vegetation was a protective factor, while living in an area with high flow accumulation index was a risk factor.Seroprevalence of infection was high in both rural and urban slum communities with unique risk factor profiles for each community type. Findings highlight the role of the household and the community environment as influential factors in the epidemiology of the infection. Increasing awareness is needed at the health care and public health levels to establish disease burden and options for suitable control programs.A cross-sectional serosurvey was carried out in households from urban slums, rural villages, and farms which included collection of blood samples, as well as data on sociodemographic, behavioral, and spatial variables.

Two common assumptions are that asymptomatically colonized individuals are more likely to be hospitalized and that they spend longer in the hospital per admission because of their colonization status. These assumptions have no biological basis and could impact the estimated effects of interventions in unintended ways. Therefore, we developed a model of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus transmission to explicitly evaluate the impact of these assumptions. We found that assuming that asymptomatically colonized individuals were more likely to be admitted to the hospital or spend longer in the hospital than uncolonized individuals biased results compared to a more realistic model that did not make either assumption. Results were heavily biased when estimating the impact of an intervention that directly reduced transmission in a hospital.

We assumed vaccines reduce the risk of hospitalization, infection, and transmission if infected by 95%, 60%, and 50%, respectively.With the Delta variant, vaccinated individuals are well protected against hospitalization but remain at risk of infection and should therefore apply protective behaviors (e.g., mask-wearing).

All scenarios are simulated from 2015 onwards. Total costs, quality adjusted life years (QALY), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and epidemiological impact were calculated from a providers perspective over a lifetime horizon. We used a DAA price of \u20ac35,000 and 3% discounting rates for cost and QALYs.Early DAA treatment for HIV-infected MSM is an excellent and sustainable tool to meet the WHO goal of eliminating HCV in 2030.Immediate DAA treatment lowers the incidence from 1.2\/100 person-years to 0.2\/100 person-years (interquartile range 0.1-0.2) and the prevalence from 5.0\/100 person-years to 0.5\/100 person-years (0.4-0.6) after 20 years. Delayed treatment awaiting spontaneous clearance will result in a similar reduction. However, further delayed treatment to F2 will increases the incidence and prevalence. Earlier treatment will cost society \u20ac68.3 and \u20ac75.1 million over a lifetime for immediate and awaiting until the chronic stage, respectively. The cost will increase if treatment is further delayed until F2 to \u20ac98.4 million. Immediate treatment will prevent 7070 new infections and gains 3419 (3019-3854) QALYs compared to F2 treatment resulting in a cost saving ICER. Treatment in the chronic stage is however dominated.Treatment of hepatitis C virus infections (HCV) with direct acting antivirals (DAA) can prevent new infections since cured individuals cannot transmit HCV. However, as DAAs are expensive, many countries defer treatment to advances stages of fibrosis, which results in ongoing transmission.

H5N1 has remained endemic in China and globally for nearly two decades, and in 2013, a novel zoonotic influenza A subtype H7N9 emerged in China. This study aimed to improve upon our current understanding of the spreading mechanisms of H7N9 and H5N1 by generating spatial risk profiles for each of the two virus subtypes across mainland China.In this study, we (i) developed a refined data set of H5N1 and H7N9 locations with consideration of animal\/animal environment case data, as well as spatial accuracy and precision; (ii) used this data set along with environmental variables to build species distribution models (SDMs) for each virus subtype in high resolution spatial units of 1km2 cells using Maxent; (iii) developed a risk modelling framework which integrated the results from the SDMs with human and chicken population variables, which was done to quantify the risk of zoonotic transmission; and (iv) identified areas at high risk of H5N1 and H7N9 transmission. We produced high performing SDMs (6 of 8 models with AUC > 0.9) for both H5N1 and H7N9. In all our SDMs, H7N9 consistently showed higher AUC results compared to H5N1, suggesting H7N9 suitability could be better explained by environmental variables. For both subtypes, high risk areas were primarily located in south-eastern China, with H5N1 distributions found to be more diffuse and extending more inland compared to H7N9.We provide projections of our risk models to public health policy makers so that specific high risk areas can be targeted for control measures. We recommend comparing H5N1 and H7N9 prevalence rates and survivability in the natural environment to better understand the role of animal and environmental transmission in human infections.","journal":"PloS one","reference":"Bui CM, Gardner L, MacIntyre R, Sarkar S.

Experimental studies in non-human primates infected with different inoculum doses of hepatitis B virus have shown a non-monotonic relationship between dose magnitude and infection outcome, with high and low doses leading to 100% liver infection and intermediate doses leading to less than 0.1% liver infection, corresponding to CD4 T-cell priming. Since hepatitis B clearance is CD8 T-cell mediated, the question of whether the inoculum dose influences CD8 T-cell dynamics arises. To help answer this question, we developed a mathematical model of virus-host interaction following hepatitis B virus infection. Our model explains the experimental data well, and predicts that the inoculum dose affects both the timing of the CD8 T-cell expansion and the quality of its response, especially the non-cytotoxic function. We find that a low-dose challenge leads to slow CD8 T-cell expansion, weak non-cytotoxic functions, and virus persistence; high- and medium-dose challenges lead to fast CD8 T-cell expansion, strong cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic function, and virus clearance; while a super-low-dose challenge leads to delayed CD8 T-cell expansion, strong cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic function, and virus clearance. These results are useful for designing immune cell-based interventions.","journal":"Proceedings. Biological sciences","reference":"Ciupe SM, Vaidya NK, Forde JE. (2021).

The calibrated model was used to simulate different intervention scenarios and estimate the impact of different interventions on outbreak size and workday loss. The use of high-efficacy facial masks was shown to be able to reduce infection cases and workday loss by 80% (90% credible interval (CrI): 73.1-85.7%) and 87% (CrI: 80.0-92.5%), respectively. The use of social distancing alone, through reduced contacts between healthcare workers, had a marginal impact on the outbreak. Our results also indicated that a quarantine policy should be coupled with other interventions to achieve its effect. The effectiveness of all these interventions was shown to increase with their early implementation.

Understanding social mixing patterns in those settings is crucial to inform the implementation of strategies for disease prevention and control. We characterized contact and social mixing patterns in rural communities of the Peruvian highlands.This cross-sectional study was nested in a large prospective household-based study of respiratory infections conducted in the province of San Marcos, Cajamarca-Peru. Members of study households were interviewed using a structured questionnaire of social contacts (conversation or physical interaction) experienced during the last 24 hours. We identified 9015 reported contacts from 588 study household members. The median age of respondents was 17 years (interquartile range [IQR] 4-34 years). The median number of reported contacts was 12 (IQR 8-20) whereas the median number of physical (i.e. skin-to-skin) contacts was 8.5 (IQR 5-14). Study participants had contacts mostly with people of similar age, and with their offspring or parents. The number of reported contacts was mainly determined by the participants' age, household size and occupation. School-aged children had more contacts than other age groups. Within-household reciprocity of contacts reporting declined with household size (range 70%-100%). Ninety percent of household contact networks were complete, and furthermore, household members' contacts with non-household members showed significant overlap (range 33%-86%), indicating a high degree of contact clustering. A two-level mixing epidemic model was simulated to compare within-household mixing based on observed contact networks and within-household random mixing. No differences in the size or duration of the simulated epidemics were revealed.This study of rural low-density communities in the highlands of Peru suggests contact patterns are highly assortative.

Models were developed jointly by local disease modelling groups to estimate cases, resource needs and deaths due to COVID-19. The National COVID-19 Epi Model (NCEM) while initially developed as a deterministic compartmental model of SARS-Cov-2 transmission in the nine provinces of South Africa, was adapted several times over the course of the first wave of infection in response to emerging local data and changing needs of government. By the end of the first wave, the NCEM had developed into a stochastic, spatially-explicit compartmental transmission model to estimate the total and reported incidence of COVID-19 across the 52 districts of South Africa. The model adopted a generalised Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed structure that accounted for the clinical profile of SARS-COV-2 (asymptomatic, mild, severe and critical cases) and avenues of treatment access (outpatient, and hospitalisation in non-ICU and ICU wards). Between end-March and early September 2020, the model was updated 11 times with four key releases to generate new sets of projections and scenario analyses to be shared with planners in the national and provincial Departments of Health, the National Treasury and other partners. Updates to model structure included finer spatial granularity, limited access to treatment, and the inclusion of behavioural heterogeneity in relation to the adoption of Public Health and Social Measures. These updates were made in response to local data and knowledge and the changing needs of the planners. The NCEM attempted to incorporate a high level of local data to contextualise the model appropriately to address South Africa's population and health system characteristics that played a vital role in producing and updating estimates of resource needs, demonstrating the importance of harnessing and developing local modelling capacity.","journal":"PLOS global public health","reference":"Silal SP, Pulliam JRC, Meyer-Rath G, Jamieson L, Nichols BE, Norman J, Hounsell R, Mayet S, Kagoro F, Moultrie H.

Subsequent data collected in the longer-term follow-up phase, however, have raised concerns about a potential increase in hospitalization risk of subsequent dengue infections, in particular among young, dengue-na\u00efve vaccinees. We here report predictions from eight independent modelling groups on the long-term safety, public health impact, and cost-effectiveness of routine vaccination with Dengvaxia in a range of transmission settings, as characterised by seroprevalence levels among 9-y-olds (SP9). These predictions were conducted for the World Health Organization to inform their recommendations on optimal use of this vaccine.Dengvaxia has the potential to reduce the burden of dengue disease in areas of moderate to high dengue endemicity. However, the potential risks of vaccination in areas with limited exposure to dengue as well as the local costs and benefits of routine vaccination are important considerations for the inclusion of Dengvaxia into existing immunisation programmes. These results were important inputs into WHO global policy for use of this licensed dengue vaccine.The models adopted, with small variations, a parsimonious vaccine mode of action that was able to reproduce quantitative features of the observed trial data. The adopted mode of action assumed that vaccination, similarly to natural infection, induces transient, heterologous protection and, further, establishes a long-lasting immunogenic memory, which determines disease severity of subsequent infections. The default vaccination policy considered was routine vaccination of 9-y-old children in a three-dose schedule at 80% coverage. The outcomes examined were the impact of vaccination on infections, symptomatic dengue, hospitalised dengue, deaths, and cost-effectiveness over a 30-y postvaccination period. Case definitions were chosen in accordance with the Phase III trials. All models predicted that in settings with moderate to high dengue endemicity (SP9 \u2265 50%), the default vaccination policy would reduce the burden of dengue disease for the population by 6%-25% (all simulations: -3%-34%) and in high-transmission settings (SP9 \u2265 70%) by 13%-25% (all simulations: 10%- 34%). These endemicity levels are representative of the participating sites in both Phase III trials. In contrast, in settings with low transmission intensity (SP9 \u2264 30%), the models predicted that vaccination could lead to a substantial increase in hospitalisation because of dengue. Modelling reduced vaccine coverage or the addition of catch-up campaigns showed that the impact of vaccination scaled approximately linearly with the number of people vaccinated. In assessing the optimal age of vaccination, we found that targeting older children could increase the net benefit of vaccination in settings with moderate transmission intensity (SP9 = 50%). Overall, vaccination was predicted to be potentially cost-effective in most endemic settings if priced competitively. The results are based on the assumption that the vaccine acts similarly to natural infection. This assumption is consistent with the available trial results but cannot be directly validated in the absence of additional data. Furthermore, uncertainties remain regarding the level of protection provided against disease versus infection and the rate at which vaccine-induced protection declines.","journal":"PLoS medicine","reference":"Flasche S, Jit M, Rodr\u00edguez-Barraquer I, Coudeville L, Recker M, Koelle K, Milne G, Hladish TJ, Perkins TA, Cummings DA, Dorigatti I, Laydon DJ, Espa\u00f1a G, Kelso J, Longini I, Lourenco J, Pearson CA, Reiner RC, Mier-Y-Ter\u00e1n-Romero L, Vannice K, Ferguson N.

To improve our understanding of how population structures and changes therein influence disease transmission dynamics at the individual and population level, we model a dynamic age- and household-structured population using longitudinal microdata drawn from Belgian census and population registers. At different points in time, we simulate the spread of a close-contact infectious disease and vary the age profiles of infectiousness and susceptibility to reflect specific infections (e.g. influenza and SARS-CoV-2) using a two-level mixing model, which distinguishes between exposure to infection in the household and exposure in the community. We find that the strong relationship between age and household structures, in combination with social mixing patterns and epidemiological parameters, shape the spread of an emerging infection. Disease transmission in the adult population in particular is to a large degree explained by differential household compositions and not just household size. Moreover, we highlight how demographic processes alter population structures in an ageing population and how these in turn affect disease transmission dynamics across population groups.","journal":"Journal of the Royal Society, Interface","reference":"M\u00f8gelmose S, Vijnck L, Neven F, Neels K, Beutels P, Hens N.

We need to know the expected health burden and treatment cost, and understand uncertainty in those estimates, to inform policymaking and future research. Two models that have been important in informing treatment guidelines and assessments of HCV burden were compared by simulating cohorts of individuals with chronic HCV infection initially aged 20, 35 and 50\u00a0years. One model predicts that health losses (measured in quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) and treatment costs decrease with increasing initial age of the patients, whilst the other model predicts that below 40\u00a0years, costs increase and QALY losses change little with age, and above 40\u00a0years, they decline with increasing age. Average per-patient costs differ between the models by up to 38%, depending on the patients' initial age. One model predicts double the total number, and triple the peak annual incidence, of liver transplants compared to the other model. One model predicts 55%-314% more deaths than the other, depending on the patients' initial age. The main sources of difference between the models are estimated progression rates between disease states and rates of health service utilization associated with different disease states and, in particular, the age dependency of these parameters.

However, genomic data can be poorly informative of transmission events if mutations accumulate too slowly to resolve individual transmission pairs or if there exist multiple pathogens lineages within-host, and there has been little focus on incorporating other types of outbreak data. We present here a methodology that uses contact data for the inference of transmission trees in a statistically rigorous manner, alongside genomic data and temporal data. Contact data is frequently collected in outbreaks of pathogens spread by close contact, including Ebola virus (EBOV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), and routinely used to reconstruct transmission chains. As an improvement over previous, ad-hoc approaches, we developed a probabilistic model that relates a set of contact data to an underlying transmission tree and integrated this in the outbreaker2 inference framework. By analyzing simulated outbreaks under various contact tracing scenarios, we demonstrate that contact data significantly improves our ability to reconstruct transmission trees, even under realistic limitations on the coverage of the contact tracing effort and the amount of non-infectious mixing between cases. Indeed, contact data is equally or more informative than fully sampled whole genome sequence data in certain scenarios. We then use our method to analyze the early stages of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore and describe the range of transmission scenarios consistent with contact data and genetic sequence in a probabilistic manner for the first time. This simple yet flexible model can easily be incorporated into existing tools for outbreak reconstruction and should permit a better integration of genomic and epidemiological data for inferring transmission chains.","journal":"PLoS computational biology","reference":"Campbell F, Cori A, Ferguson N, Jombart T.

Wind dispersed plants have emerged as a useful study system for investigating how climate change affects dispersal, though studies modeling wind dispersal often assume propagules are released from a single point on an individual. This simplifying assumption, while useful, may misestimate dispersal. Here, we investigate effects of climate change on dispersal distances and spread rates, examining how these quantities shift when accounting for all points of seed release on an individual. Using the wind-dispersed invasive thistles Carduus nutans and Carduus acanthoides, we quantify temperature-driven shifts in the distribution of flower head heights using a passive warming field experiment, and estimate how these shifts affect dispersal using the Wald analytical long distance (WALD) model; for C. nutans, we use existing demographic data to simulate how these shifts affect population spread rates. We also compare dispersal distances for both warmed and ambient temperature plants, considering the entire distribution of flower head heights versus the common assumption of point-source seed release at the maximum height. For experimentally-grown individuals, an approximately 0.6 \u00b0C higher growing temperature increased mean and maximum flower head height by 14.1 cm (15.0%) and 14.0 cm (13.2%), respectively, in C. nutans and by 21.2 cm (26.6%) and 31.8 cm (36.7%), respectively, in C. acanthoides. Seeds from warmed individuals were more likely to exceed a given dispersal distance than those from their unwarmed counterparts; warmed C. nutans and C. acanthoides seeds were on average 1.36 and 1.71 times as likely, respectively, to travel 10 m or more in dispersal simulations, with this disparity becoming higher at longer dispersal distances. For C. nutans, increased growing temperatures boosted simulated rates of population spread by 42.2%, while assuming dispersal from a maximum-height point source rather than the true distribution of flower head heights increased simulated spread by up to 28.5%. Our results not only demonstrate faster population spread under increased temperatures, but also have substantial implications for modeling such spread, as the common simplifying assumption of dispersal from a single maximum-height source may substantially overestimate spread rates.

Mixed-effects models were used to calculate the average increase in partner age for each year increase in age of participant, the average partner age for 15\u202fyear olds, and the between-subject and the within-subject standard deviation of partner ages. We conducted 2000 bootstrap replications of the models. Using negative binomial models, we also explored whether HIV status was associated with participants having a larger range in partner ages.HIV positive women had large variability in partner ages at the population level, and at the individual level had nearly three times the expected range of partner ages compared to HIV negative women. This pattern may increase the potential for HIV transmission across birth cohorts and may partially explain the persistence of the epidemic in South Africa. Young men, who have been previously absent from the age-disparity discourse, also choose older partners who may be putting them at increased risk of HIV infection due to the high HIV prevalence among older age categories of women.Age-disparate relationships are thought to put young women at increased risk of HIV, though current evidence is inconclusive.

The budding yeast cell cycle is also one of the best-studied dynamical systems owing to its thoroughly resolved genetics. However, the dynamics underlying the crucial cell cycle decision point called the START transition, at which the cell commits to a new round of DNA replication and cell division, are under-studied. The START machinery involves a central cyclin-dependent kinase; cyclins responsible for starting the transition, bud formation, and initiating DNA synthesis; and their transcriptional regulators. However, evidence has shown that the mechanism is more complicated than a simple irreversible transition switch. Activating a key transcription regulator SBF requires the phosphorylation of its inhibitor, Whi5, or an SBF\/MBF monomeric component, Swi6, but not necessarily both. Also, the timing and mechanism of the inhibitor Whi5's nuclear export, while important, are not critical for the timing and execution of START. Therefore, there is a need for a consolidated model for the budding yeast START transition, reconciling regulatory and spatial dynamics. We built a detailed mathematical model (START-BYCC) for the START transition in the budding yeast cell cycle based on established molecular interactions and experimental phenotypes. START-BYCC recapitulates the underlying dynamics and correctly emulates key phenotypic traits of ~150 known START mutants, including regulation of size control, localization of inhibitor\/transcription factor complexes, and the nutritional effects on size control. Such a detailed mechanistic understanding of the underlying dynamics gets us closer towards deconvoluting the aberrant cellular development in cancer.","journal":"PLoS computational biology","reference":"Ravi J, Samart K, Zwolak J.

The statistical and practical advantages and flaws of these methods were examined. Both discrimination and calibration of the estimated logistic models of dichotomized outcomes and continuation-ratio logit model were assessed.Medical outcomes of interest to clinicians may have multiple categories. Researchers face several options for risk prediction of such outcomes, including dichotomized logistic regression and multinomial logit regression modeling. We aimed to compare these methods and provide guidance needed for practice.The dichotomized logistic models and multinomial continuation-ratio logit model had similar discrimination and calibration in predicting death and survival without neurodevelopmental impairment. But the continuation-ratio logit model had better discrimination and calibration in predicting neurodevelopmental impairment. The sum of predicted probabilities of outcome categories from the dichotomized logistic models could deviate from 100% substantially, ranging from 87.7 to 124.0%, and the dichotomized logistic model of neurodevelopmental impairment greatly overpredicted low risks and underpredicted high risks.Estimating multiple logistic regression models of dichotomized outcomes may result in poorly calibrated predictions for an outcome with multiple ordinal categories. Multinomial continuation-ratio logit regression produces better calibrated predictions, constrains the sum of predicted probabilities to 100%, and has the advantages of simplicity in model interpretation, flexibility to include outcome category-specific predictors and random-effect terms for patient heterogeneity by hospital. It also accounts for mutual dependence among multiple categories and accommodates competing risks.","journal":"BMC medical research methodology","reference":"Li L, Rysavy MA, Bobashev G, Das A.

The result was robust across a range of plausible input values, and to assumptions regarding the duration of vaccine protection.The nonavalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been shown to extend protection against oncogenic HPV types 31\/33\/45\/52\/58 (HPV-OV) not covered by the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines. Besides its clinical benefit, evidence on the economic value of the nonavalent vaccine is required to inform local vaccination strategies and funding decisions. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of replacing the bivalent vaccine with the nonavalent vaccine in the national school-based HPV vaccination programme in Singapore.Given the high ICER, the nonavalent vaccine is unlikely to represent a cost-effective option compared with the bivalent vaccine for school-based HPV vaccination of 13-year old female students in Singapore. Substantial price reductions would be required to justify its inclusion in the school-based programme in the future.An existing age-structured dynamic transmission model coupled with stochastic individual-based simulations was adapted to project the health and economic impact of vaccinating 13-year-old girls with two doses of the nonavalent or bivalent HPV vaccines in Singapore. Direct costs (in Singapore dollars, S$) were obtained from public healthcare institutions in Singapore, while health state utilities were sourced from the literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated over a lifetime horizon, from a healthcare system perspective.

Similar to people, dogs are hosts for Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp., Ehrlichia spp. and Borrelia burgdorferi. Dogs also share our homes and beds, making them both a sentinel for the ticks in our backyards but also increasing our exposure to ticks. Measures to better track, prevent, and\/or treat tick-borne diseases in companion animals can lead to better control and prevention of human tick-borne disease. This study identifies demographic and co-infection risk factors for canine seropositivity to tick-borne infections in a cohort of hunting dogs across the USA.Human patterns of tick-borne disease co-infection in the USA have been predominantly driven by the geographical distribution of the tick vector. Dogs who tested seropositive for Anaplasma spp. were 1.40 times more likely (P = 0.0242) to also test seropositive for Babesia spp. and vice versa (1.60 times more likely, P = 0.0014). Dogs living in the West had 5% lower risk (P = 0.0001) for Ehrlichia spp. seropositivity compared to other regions. Controlling for age and Anaplasma spp. seroprevalence, dogs in all three other regions were 2.30 times more likely (P = 0.0216) to test seropositive for B. burgdorferi than dogs in the West. Dogs seropositive for B. burgdorferi were 1.60 times more likely (P = 0.0473) to be seropositive for Anaplasma spp.Tick geographical distributions have a prominent impact on the regional distribution of hunting dog exposure to tick-borne diseases. Education concerning regional tick prevalence and disease risk is important for everyone, but particularly dog owners, regarding ticks in their region and protection from infection and co-infection of tick-borne pathogens as they travel or move with their dogs. Dogs are sentinel species for human exposure to ticks, and as such surveillance of canine tick-borne infections and understanding the probability that these infections might be seen together as co-infections helps predict emerging areas where people are more likely to be exposed as well.","journal":"Parasites & vectors","reference":"Mahachi K, Kontowicz E, Anderson B, Toepp AJ, Lima AL, Larson M, Wilson G, Grinnage-Pulley T, Bennett C, Ozanne M, Anderson M, Fowler H, Parrish M, Saucier J, Tyrrell P, Palmer Z, Buch J, Chandrashekar R, Scorza B, Brown G, Oleson JJ, Petersen CA.

After adjustment for contact pattern and vaccination status, the increase in susceptibility to the Delta vs pre-Delta variant was estimated to be highest in the group aged 10 to 15 years, approximately doubling (1.92-fold increase [95% CI, 1.86-fold to 1.98-fold]), whereas in the group aged 50 years or more, susceptibility to the Delta vs pre-Delta variant remained stable at an approximately 1-fold change (eg, among individuals aged 50-55 years: 0.997-fold [95% CI, 0.989-fold to 1.001-fold).Age group during the third wave (ie, before Delta) and fourth wave (ie, Delta-driven) of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea.Age-specific susceptibility during the third and fourth waves was estimated.This decision analytic model used an age-structured compartmental model using the terms symptom onset (S), exposure (E), infectious (I), and quarantine (Q) (SEIQ) to estimate the age-specific force of infection, combining age-specific contact matrices and observed distribution of periods between each stage of infection (E to I [ie, latent period], I given S, and S to Q [ie, diagnostic delay]) developed in a previous contact tracing study. A bayesian inference method was used to estimate the age-specific force of infection (S to E) and, accordingly, age-specific susceptibility. The age-specific susceptibility during the third wave (ie, before Delta, from October 15 to December 22, 2020, when the COVID-19 vaccination campaign was not yet launched) and the fourth wave (ie, the Delta-driven wave, from June 27 to August 21, 2021) in Korea were compared. As vaccine uptake increased, individuals who were vaccinated were excluded from the susceptible population in accordance with vaccine effectiveness against the Delta variant. This nationwide epidemiologic study included individuals who were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period in Korea. Data were analyzed from September to November 2021.In this study, the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to propagate more easily among children and adolescents than pre-Delta strains, even after adjusting for contact pattern and vaccination status.To gain a better understanding of the association of age with susceptibility to the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2.","journal":"JAMA network open","reference":"Chun JY, Jeong H, Kim Y.

Forecast skill was evaluated using a modified logarithmic score. We averaged submitted forecasts into a mean ensemble model and compared them against predictions based on historical trends. Forecast skill was highest for seasonal peak intensity and short-term forecasts, while forecast skill for timing of season onset and peak week was generally low. Higher forecast skill was associated with team participation in previous influenza forecasting challenges and utilization of ensemble forecasting techniques. The mean ensemble consistently performed well and outperformed historical trend predictions.

The transition patterns among hesitancy profiles over three periods were identified using a latent transition analysis with individuals from a longitudinal cohort study since the emergence of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Four profiles (i.e., skeptics, apathetics, fence-sitters, and believers) emerged consistently over time. From Period 1 (third and fourth pandemic waves) to Period 2 (dormant period, vaccine rollout), 14.17% of believers became fence-sitters (ambivalization), and 12.11% of fence-sitters became apathetics (apathetization). From Period 2 to Period 3 (omicron surge and vaccine mandates), 20.21% of believers became fence-sitters. Lower trust in government predicted a transition to skepticism, whereas higher trust predicted the opposite. Staying as believers was associated with decreased hygienic and social distancing behavior. The stable hesitancy profiles amid the rapid vaccine uptake suggest that structural factors rather than personal agency may drive the surge. Ambivalization and apathetization may signal disengagement in preventive behaviors. Trust in the government is crucial in the pandemic response. Public health interventions may improve compliance with guidelines and prevent skepticism and apathy.","journal":"Applied psychology.

However, current available evidence on second booster dose effectiveness are mostly limited to high-income countries, older adults, and mRNA-based vaccination schemes scenarios. We aimed to investigate the relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of the fourth dose compared to three doses for severe COVID-19 outcomes in Brazil; and compare the rVE of a fourth dose with an mRNA vaccine compared to adenovirus-based product in the same settings.We performed a target emulated trial using a population-based cohort of individuals aged 40 years or older who have received a homologous primary scheme of CoronaVac, ChAdOx1, or BNT162b2, and any third dose product and were eligible for the fourth dose in Brazil. The primary outcome was COVID-19 associated hospitalization or death. We built Cohort A matching individuals vaccinated with a fourth dose to individuals who received three doses to estimate the rVE of the fourth dose. We built Cohort B, a subset of Cohort A, matching mRNA-based (mRNA) to adenovirus-based fourth dose vaccinated individuals to compare their relative hazards for severe COVID-19.46,693,484 individuals were included in Cohort A and 6,763,016 in Cohort B. 45% of them were aged between 40 and 60 years old, and 48% between 60 and 79 years old. In Cohort A, the most common previous series was a ChAdOx1 two-dose followed by BNT162b2 (44%), and a CoronaVac two-dose followed by a BNT162b2 (36%). Among those fourth dose vaccinated, 36.9% received ChAdOx1, 32.7% Ad26.COV2.S, 25.8% BNT162b2, and 4.7% CoronaVac. In Cohort B, among those who received an adenovirus fourth dose, 53.7% received ChAdOx1 and 46.3% received Ad26.COV2.S. The estimated rVE for the primary outcome of four doses compared to three doses was 44.1% (95% CI 42.3-46.0), with some waning during follow-up (rVE 7-60 days 46.8% [95% CI 44.4-49.1], rVE after 120 days 33.8% [95% CI 18.0-46.6]). Among fourth dose vaccinated individuals, mRNA-based vaccinated individuals had lower hazards for hospitalization or death compared to adenovirus-vaccinated individuals (HR\u00a00.81, 95% CI 0.75-0.87). After 120 days, no difference in hazards between groups was observed (HR 1.35, 95% CI 0.93-1.97). Similar findings were observed for hospitalization and death separately, except no evidence for differences between fourth dose brands for death in Cohort B.In a heterogeneous scenario of primary and first booster vaccination combinations, a fourth dose provided meaningful and durable protection against severe COVID-19 outcomes.

Monitoring these trends over time is also key to understanding where interventions are having an impact. Proven interventions exist to prevent or treat the leading causes of unnecessary death and disability among children and adolescents. The findings presented here show that these are underused and give guidance to policy makers in countries where more attention is needed.Of the 7.7 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 7.4-8.1) million deaths among children and adolescents globally in 2013, 6.28 million occurred among younger children, 0.48 million among older children, and 0.97 million among adolescents. In 2013, the leading causes of death were lower respiratory tract infections among younger children (905.059 deaths; 95% UI, 810,304-998,125), diarrheal diseases among older children (38,325 deaths; 95% UI, 30,365-47,678), and road injuries among adolescents (115,186 deaths; 95% UI, 105,185-124,870). Iron deficiency anemia was the leading cause of years lived with disability among children and adolescents, affecting 619 (95% UI, 618-621) million in 2013. Large between-country variations exist in mortality from leading causes among children and adolescents. Countries with rapid declines in all-cause mortality between 1990 and 2013 also experienced large declines in most leading causes of death, whereas countries with the slowest declines had stagnant or increasing trends in the leading causes of death. In 2013, Nigeria had a 12% global share of deaths from lower respiratory tract infections and a 38% global share of deaths from malaria. India had 33% of the world's deaths from neonatal encephalopathy. Half of the world's diarrheal deaths among children and adolescents occurred in just 5 countries: India, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Ethiopia.The literature focuses on mortality among children younger than 5 years. Comparable information on nonfatal health outcomes among these children and the fatal and nonfatal burden of diseases and injuries among older children and adolescents is scarce.To determine levels and trends in the fatal and nonfatal burden of diseases and injuries among younger children (aged <5 years), older children (aged 5-9 years), and adolescents (aged 10-19 years) between 1990 and 2013 in 188 countries from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 study.Data from vital registration, verbal autopsy studies, maternal and child death surveillance, and other sources covering 14,244 site-years (ie, years of cause of death data by geography) from 1980 through 2013 were used to estimate cause-specific mortality. Data from 35,620 epidemiological sources were used to estimate the prevalence of the diseases and sequelae in the GBD 2013 study. Cause-specific mortality for most causes was estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble Model strategy. For some infectious diseases (eg, HIV infection\/AIDS, measles, hepatitis B) where the disease process is complex or the cause of death data were insufficient or unavailable, we used natural history models. For most nonfatal health outcomes, DisMod-MR 2.0, a Bayesian metaregression tool, was used to meta-analyze the epidemiological data to generate prevalence estimates.","journal":"JAMA pediatrics","reference":"Kyu HH, Pinho C, Wagner JA, Brown JC, Bertozzi-Villa A, Charlson FJ, Coffeng LE, Dandona L, Erskine HE, Ferrari AJ, Fitzmaurice C, Fleming TD, Forouzanfar MH, Graetz N, Guinovart C, Haagsma J, Higashi H, Kassebaum NJ, Larson HJ, Lim SS, Mokdad AH, Moradi-Lakeh M, Odell SV, Roth GA, Serina PT, Stanaway JD, Misganaw A, Whiteford HA, Wolock TM, Wulf Hanson S, Abd-Allah F, Abera SF, Abu-Raddad LJ, AlBuhairan FS, Amare AT, Antonio CA, Artaman A, Barker-Collo SL, Barrero LH, Benjet C, Bensenor IM, Bhutta ZA, Bikbov B, Brazinova A, Campos-Nonato I, Casta\u00f1eda-Orjuela CA, Catal\u00e1-L\u00f3pez F, Chowdhury R, Cooper C, Crump JA, Dandona R, Degenhardt L, Dellavalle RP, Dharmaratne SD, Faraon EJ, Feigin VL, F\u00fcrst T, Geleijnse JM, Gessner BD, Gibney KB, Goto A, Gunnell D, Hankey GJ, Hay RJ, Hornberger JC, Hosgood HD, Hu G, Jacobsen KH, Jayaraman SP, Jeemon P, Jonas JB, Karch A, Kim D, Kim S, Kokubo Y, Kuate Defo B, Kucuk Bicer B, Kumar GA, Larsson A, Leasher JL, Leung R, Li Y, Lipshultz SE, Lopez AD, Lotufo PA, Lunevicius R, Lyons RA, Majdan M, Malekzadeh R, Mashal T, Mason-Jones AJ, Melaku YA, Memish ZA, Mendoza W, Miller TR, Mock CN, Murray J, Nolte S, Oh IH, Olusanya BO, Ortblad KF, Park EK, Paternina Caicedo AJ, Patten SB, Patton GC, Pereira DM, Perico N, Piel FB, Polinder S, Popova S, Pourmalek F, Quistberg DA, Remuzzi G, Rodriguez A, Rojas-Rueda D, Rothenbacher D, Rothstein DH, Sanabria J, Santos IS, Schwebel DC, Sepanlou SG, Shaheen A, Shiri R, Shiue I, Skirbekk V, Sliwa K, Sreeramareddy CT, Stein DJ, Steiner TJ, Stovner LJ, Sykes BL, Tabb KM, Terkawi AS, Thomson AJ, Thorne-Lyman AL, Towbin JA, Ukwaja KN, Vasankari T, Venketasubramanian N, Vlassov VV, Vollset SE, Weiderpass E, Weintraub RG, Werdecker A, Wilkinson JD, Woldeyohannes SM, Wolfe CD, Yano Y, Yip P, Yonemoto N, Yoon SJ, Younis MZ, Yu C, El Sayed Zaki M, Naghavi M, Murray CJ, Vos T.

They may consider it as a last resort option if alternative control measures fail to reduce transmission.AimWe developed a modelling framework to ascertain the use of lockdown to ensure intensive care unit (ICU) capacity does not exceed a peak target defined by policymakers.MethodsWe used a deterministic compartmental model describing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the trajectories of COVID-19 patients in healthcare settings, accounting for age-specific mixing patterns and an increasing probability of severe outcomes with age. The framework is illustrated in the context of metropolitan France.ResultsThe daily incidence of ICU admissions and the number of occupied ICU beds are the most robust indicators to decide when a lockdown should be triggered. When the doubling time of hospitalisations estimated before lockdown is between 8 and 20 days, lockdown should be enforced when ICU admissions reach 3.0-3.7 and 7.8-9.5 per million for peak targets of 62 and 154 ICU beds per million (4,000 and 10,000 beds for metropolitan France), respectively. When implemented earlier, the lockdown duration required to get back below a desired level is also shorter.ConclusionsWe provide simple indicators and triggers to decide if and when a last-resort lockdown should be implemented to avoid saturation of ICU. These metrics can support the planning and real-time management of successive COVID-19 pandemic waves.","journal":"Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin","reference":"Tran Kiem C, Cr\u00e9pey P, Bosetti P, Levy Bruhl D, Yazdanpanah Y, Salje H, Boelle PY, Cauchemez S.

However, with evidence of waning efficacy coupled with continued evolution of the virus, health programmes need to evaluate the requirement for regular booster doses, considering their impact and cost-effectiveness in the face of ongoing transmission and substantial infection-induced immunity.Our modelling suggests that regular boosting of the high-risk population remains an important tool to reduce morbidity and mortality from current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our results suggest that focusing vaccination in the highest-risk cohorts will be the most efficient (and hence cost-effective) strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality.We developed a combined immunological-transmission model parameterised with data on transmissibility, severity, and vaccine effectiveness. We simulated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and vaccine rollout in characteristic global settings with different population age-structures, contact patterns, health system capacities, prior transmission, and vaccine uptake. We quantified the impact of future vaccine booster dose strategies with both ancestral and variant-adapted vaccine products, while considering the potential future emergence of new variants with modified transmission, immune escape, and severity properties. We found that regular boosting of the oldest age group (75+) is an efficient strategy, although large numbers of hospitalisations and deaths could be averted by extending vaccination to younger age groups. In countries with low vaccine coverage and high infection-derived immunity, boosting older at-risk groups was more effective than continuing primary vaccination into younger ages in our model. Our study is limited by uncertainty in key parameters, including the long-term durability of vaccine and infection-induced immunity as well as uncertainty in the future evolution of the virus.","journal":"PLoS medicine","reference":"Hogan AB, Wu SL, Toor J, Olivera Mesa D, Doohan P, Watson OJ, Winskill P, Charles G, Barnsley G, Riley EM, Khoury DS, Ferguson NM, Ghani AC.

Five persistence models representing first-order decay and nonlinear decay profiles were fit to a comprehensive database of 629 data sets for fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), bacteriophages, bacteria, viruses, and protozoa mined from the literature. Initial periods of minimal decay and decay rates tapering off over time were often observed, and a two-parameter model, based on the logistic probability distribution, provided the best fit to the data most frequently. First-order decay kinetics provided the best fit to less than 20% of the analyzed data. Using the best fitting models in this analysis, T90 and T99 metrics were calculated for each data set and used as the dependent variable in a variety of exploratory factor analyses. Random forest methods identified temperature and predation as some of the most important water quality factors influencing persistence, and the protozoa target type differed the most from FIB. This analysis further confirmed the interactions between temperature and predation and suggests that pH and turbidity be more frequently documented in persistence studies to further elucidate their impact on target persistence. The findings from this analysis and the calculated persistence metrics can be used to better inform quantitative microbial risk assessments and may lead to improved predictions of human health risks and water management decisions.","journal":"Environmental science & technology","reference":"Dean K, Mitchell J.

Because SARS-CoV-2 can spread from individuals with pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, and asymptomatic infections, the re-opening of societies and the control of virus spread will be facilitated by robust population screening, for which virus testing will often be central. After infection, individuals undergo a period of incubation during which viral titers are usually too low to detect, followed by an exponential viral growth, leading to a peak viral load and infectiousness, and ending with declining viral levels and clearance. Given the pattern of viral load kinetics, we model the effectiveness of repeated population screening considering test sensitivities, frequency, and sample-to-answer reporting time. These results demonstrate that effective screening depends largely on frequency of testing and the speed of reporting, and is only marginally improved by high test sensitivity. We therefore conclude that screening should prioritize accessibility, frequency, and sample-to-answer time; analytical limits of detection should be secondary.","journal":"Science advances","reference":"Larremore DB, Wilder B, Lester E, Shehata S, Burke JM, Hay JA, Tambe M, Mina MJ, Parker R.

The secondary outcomes were total numbers of emergency department visits, hospital discharges, skilled nursing facility discharges, and magnetic resonance imaging orders.In total, the data set included 1836 ACO-year (number of participation years per ACO) observations for 620 distinct ACOs. Those ACOs with a specialist encounter proportion of 40% to less than 45% had $1129 (95% CI, $445-$1814) lower per-beneficiary person-year spending than did ACOs in the lowest specialist encounter proportion group and had $752 (95% CI, $115-$1389) lower per-beneficiary person-year spending compared with ACOs in the highest specialist encounter proportion group. Monotonic decreases in emergency department visits, hospital discharges, and skilled nursing facility discharges were observed with increasing specialist encounter proportion. Conversely, monotonic increases in magnetic resonance imaging volume discharges were observed with increasing specialist encounter proportion.Accountable care organizations (ACOs) aim to control health expenditures while improving quality of care. Primary care has been emphasized as a means to reduce spending, but little is known about the implications of using specialists for achieving this ACO objective.These findings suggest that an ACO's ability to reduce spending may require sufficient involvement in care processes from specialists, who seem to complement the intrinsic primary care approach in ACOs.Specialist encounter proportion, the percentage of office visits provided by a specialist, was categorized into 7 discrete groups: less than 35%, 35% to less than 40%, 40% to less than 45% (reference group), 45% to less than 50%, 50% to less than 55%, 55% to less than 60%, and 60% or greater.To examine the association between ACO-beneficiary office visits conducted by specialists and the cost and utilization outcomes of those visits.","journal":"JAMA network open","reference":"Shetty VA, Balzer LB, Geissler KH, Chin DL.

However, the relationship between contact patterns and seasonality as well as their possible association with the seasonality of respiratory diseases is yet to be clarified.We identified a significant inverse relationship between the number of contacts and the seasonal temperature trend defined as a spline interpolation of temperature data (p\u2009=\u20090.003). We estimated an average of 16.4 (95% PrI: 15.1-17.5) contacts per day in December 2017 that increased to an average of 17.6 contacts (95% PrI: 16.5-19.3) in January 2018 and then declined to an average of 10.3 (95% PrI: 9.4-10.8) in May 2018. Estimates of influenza incidence obtained by the compartmental model comply with the observed epidemiological data. The reproduction number was estimated to increase from 1.24 (95% CI: 1.21-1.27) in December to a peak of 1.34 (95% CI: 1.31-1.37) in January. The estimated median infection attack rate at the end of the season was 27.4% (95% CI: 23.7-30.5%).Our findings support a relationship between temperature and contact patterns, which can contribute to deepen the understanding of the relationship between social interactions and the epidemiology of respiratory infectious diseases.","journal":"Influenza and other respiratory viruses","reference":"Kummer AG, Zhang J, Jiang C, Litvinova M, Ventura PC, Garcia MA, Vespignani A, Wu H, Yu H, Ajelli M.

We also explored the potential benefit of implementing mitigation strategies, primarily in terms of minimising the delays to control targets.The COVID-19 pandemic has brought infectious disease control to the forefront of global consciousness. It is essential that the NTDs, so long neglected in terms of research and financial support, are not overlooked, and remain a priority in health service planning and funding.We show that the effect of the COVID-19-induced interruption in terms of delay to achieving elimination goals might in some cases be much longer than the duration of the interruption. For schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis, trachoma, and visceral leishmaniasis, a mean delay of 2-3 years for a 1-year interruption is predicted in areas of highest prevalence. We also show that these delays can largely be mitigated by measures such as additional mass drug administration or enhanced case-finding.In line with movement restrictions and physical distancing essential for the control of the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO recommended postponement of all neglected tropical disease (NTD) control activities that involve community-based surveys, active case finding, and mass drug administration in April, 2020. Following revised guidance later in 2020, and after interruptions to NTD programmes of varying lengths, NTD programmes gradually restarted in the context of an ongoing pandemic.

Demographic and health information were collected, and a linear mixed model (LMM) was used to describe antibody levels over time.Due to waning levels of maternal antibodies (measles; enterovirus 71, EV71; and coxsackievirus A16, CoxA16), some infants may lose protection against infection prior to vaccination. Using a longitudinal design, we examine how maternal antibody levels evolve over time in infants prior to vaccination.Further modifications of vaccination strategies for measles, earlier vaccination for EV71 infection, and deployment of a CoxA16 vaccine need to be considered to limit infection among the very young.Pre-vaccination monotonic antibody decreases were observed for measles (1410, 195 and 22mIU\/ml, p<0.001), EV71 (1:19.9, 6.3 and 4.5, p<0.001) and CoxA16 (1:16.3, 5.9, and 4.5, p<0.001).

Despite high vaccination coverage, countries such as Australia, USA, and UK have experienced increase in pertussis activity over the last few decades. This may be due to local pockets of low vaccination coverage that result in persistence of pertussis in the population and occasionally lead to large outbreaks. The objective of this study was to characterize the association between pertussis vaccination coverage and sociodemographic factors and pertussis incidence at the school district level in King County, Washington, USA. We used monthly pertussis incidence data for all ages reported to the Public Health Seattle and King County between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2017 to obtain school district level pertussis incidence. We obtained immunization data from the Washington State Immunization Information System to estimate school-district level vaccination coverage as proportion of 19-35 month old children fully vaccinated with \u22654 doses of the Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular-Pertussis (DTaP) vaccine in a school district. We used two methods to quantify the effects of vaccination coverage on pertussis incidence: an ecological vaccine model and an endemic-epidemic model. Even though the effect of vaccination is modeled differently in the two approaches, both models can be used to estimate the association between vaccination coverage and pertussis incidence. Using the ecological vaccine model, we estimated the vaccine effectiveness of 4 doses of Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular-Pertussis vaccine to be 83% (95% credible interval: 63%, 95%). In the endemic-epidemic model, under-vaccination was statistically significantly associated with epidemic risk of pertussis (adjusted Relative Risk, aRR: 2.76; 95% confidence interval: 1.44, 16.6). Household size and median income were statistically significantly associated with endemic pertussis risk. The endemic-epidemic model suffers from ecological bias, whereas the ecological vaccine model provides less biased and more interpretable estimates of epidemiological parameters, such as DTaP vaccine effectiveness, for each school district.","journal":"Epidemics","reference":"Rane MS, Wakefield J, Rohani P, Halloran ME.

Excess mortality was delayed by 1-2 years in 18 countries (46%). Increases in the mortality rate relative to baseline were greatest in school-aged children and young adults, with no evidence that elderly population was spared from excess mortality.

Knowledge of the COVID-19 dynamics and its potential trends amidst variations in COVID-19 vaccine coverage is therefore crucial for policy makers in the SSA region where vaccine uptake is generally lower than in high-income countries. Using a compartmental epidemiological model, this study aims to forecast the potential COVID-19 trends and determine how long a wave could be, taking into consideration the current vaccination rates. The model is calibrated using South African reported data for the first four waves of COVID-19, and the data for the fifth wave are used to test the validity of the model forecast. The model is qualitatively analysed by determining equilibria and their stability, calculating the basic reproduction number R0 and investigating the local and global sensitivity analysis with respect to R0. The impact of vaccination and control interventions are investigated via a series of numerical simulations. Based on the fitted data and simulations, we observed that massive vaccination would only be beneficial (deaths averting) if a highly effective vaccine is used, particularly in combination with non-pharmaceutical interventions. Furthermore, our forecasts demonstrate that increased vaccination coverage in SSA increases population immunity leading to low daily infection numbers in potential future waves. Our findings could be helpful in guiding policy makers and governments in designing vaccination strategies and the implementation of other COVID-19 mitigation strategies.","journal":"Royal Society open science","reference":"Malinzi J, Juma VO, Madubueze CE, Mwaonanji J, Nkem GN, Mwakilama E, Mupedza TV, Chiteri VN, Bakare EA, Moyo IL, Campillo-Funollet E, Nyabadza F, Madzvamuse A.

Mathematical models are increasingly being used to guide public health decisions on managing both antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and TB. It is important to consider bacterial heterogeneity in models as it can have consequences for predictions of resistance prevalence, which may affect decision-making. We conducted a systematic review of published mathematical models to determine the modelling landscape and to explore methods for including bacterial heterogeneity. Our first objective was to identify and analyse the general characteristics of mathematical models of DR-mycobacteria, including M. tuberculosis. The second objective was to analyse methods of including bacterial heterogeneity in these models. We had different definitions of heterogeneity depending on the model level. For between-host models of mycobacterium, heterogeneity was defined as any model where bacteria of the same resistance level were further differentiated. For bacterial population models, heterogeneity was defined as having multiple distinct resistant populations. The search was conducted following PRISMA guidelines in five databases, with studies included if they were mechanistic or simulation models of DR-mycobacteria. We identified 195 studies modelling DR-mycobacteria, with most being dynamic transmission models of non-treatment intervention impact in M. tuberculosis (n = 58). Studies were set in a limited number of specific countries, and 44% of models (n = 85) included only a single level of \"multidrug-resistance (MDR)\". Only 23 models (8 between-host) included any bacterial heterogeneity. Most of these also captured multiple antibiotic-resistant classes (n = 17), but six models included heterogeneity in bacterial populations resistant to a single antibiotic. Heterogeneity was usually represented by different fitness values for bacteria resistant to the same antibiotic (61%, n = 14). A large and growing body of mathematical models of DR-mycobacterium is being used to explore intervention impact to support policy as well as theoretical explorations of resistance dynamics. However, the majority lack bacterial heterogeneity, suggesting that important evolutionary effects may be missed.","journal":"PLoS pathogens","reference":"Fuller NM, McQuaid CF, Harker MJ, Weerasuriya CK, McHugh TD, Knight GM.

Clinical data, a bulk stool sample, and 1-2 mL of serum were collected from case children at presentation. Clinical data and stool samples were also prospectively collected from household contacts over 14 days from presentation. A single stool sample was collected from control households containing asymptomatic children who were frequency age-matched to case children. Samples were tested for rotavirus using semi-quantitative real-time PCR and for anti-rotavirus IgA using a semi-quantitative sandwich ELISA. Risk factors for household transmission of rotavirus infection and clinical disease, including disease severity and faecal shedding density, were identified using mixed effects logistic regression. Vaccine effectiveness against transmission was estimated as 1 minus the ratio of secondary attack rates in vaccinated and counterfactual unvaccinated populations, using vaccine effectiveness estimates from the associated diarrhoeal surveillance platform to estimate the counterfactual secondary attack rate without vaccination.Wellcome Trust, US National Institutes of Health, and US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Rotavirus vaccine has the potential to substantially reduce household rotavirus transmission. This finding should be considered in clinical and health economic assessments of vaccine effectiveness.Rotavirus vaccine effectiveness is reduced among children in low-income countries. Indirect (transmission-mediated) effects of rotavirus vaccine might contribute to the total population effect of vaccination. We aimed to examine risk factors for transmission of rotavirus to household contacts in Blantyre, Malawi, and estimated the effectiveness of rotavirus vaccine in preventing transmission of infection to household contacts.Between Feb 16, 2015, and Nov 11, 2016, we recruited 196 case households (705 members) and 55 control households (153 members).

Nevertheless, resolving the importance of indirect and environmental transmission in the ecology of epidemics remains a persistent challenge. It requires accurately measuring the free-living survival of pathogens across reservoirs of various kinds and quantifying the extent to which interaction between hosts and reservoirs generates new infections. These questions are especially salient for emerging pathogens, where sparse and noisy data can obfuscate the relative contribution of different infection routes. In this study, we develop a mechanistic, mathematical model that permits both direct (host-to-host) and indirect (environmental) transmission and then fit this model to empirical data from 17 countries affected by an emerging virus (SARS-CoV-2). From an ecological perspective, our model highlights the potential for environmental transmission to drive complex, nonlinear dynamics during infectious disease outbreaks. Summarizing, we propose that fitting alternative models with indirect transmission to real outbreak data from SARS-CoV-2 can be useful, as it highlights that indirect mechanisms may play an underappreciated role in the dynamics of infectious diseases, with implications for public health.","journal":"Scientific reports","reference":"Ogbunugafor CB, Miller-Dickson MD, Meszaros VA, Gomez LM, Murillo AL, Scarpino SV.

In practice, clinical use of phage often involves the application of multiple therapeutic phage, either together or sequentially. However, the selection and timing of therapeutic phage delivery remains largely ad hoc. In this study, we evaluate principles underlying why careful application of multiple phage (i.e., a 'cocktail') might lead to therapeutic success in contrast to the failure of single-strain phage therapy to control an infection. First, we use a nonlinear dynamics model of within-host interactions to show that a combination of fast intra-host phage decay, evolution of phage resistance amongst bacteria, and\/or compromised immune response might limit the effectiveness of single-strain phage therapy. To resolve these problems, we combine dynamical modeling of phage, bacteria, and host immune cell populations with control-theoretic principles (via optimal control theory) to devise evolutionarily robust phage cocktails and delivery schedules to control the bacterial populations. Our numerical results suggest that optimal administration of single-strain phage therapy may be sufficient for curative outcomes in immunocompetent patients, but may fail in immunodeficient hosts due to phage resistance. We show that optimized treatment with a two-phage cocktail that includes a counter-resistant phage can restore therapeutic efficacy in immunodeficient hosts.","journal":"Bulletin of mathematical biology","reference":"Li G, Leung CY, Wardi Y, Debarbieux L, Weitz JS.

However, risk of CDI from antibiotics varies by agent and dependent on the intensity (i.e., spectrum and duration) of antibiotic therapy. Thus, the impact of stewardship interventions on CDI incidence is variable, and understanding this risk requires a more granular measure of intensity of therapy than traditionally used measures like days of therapy (DOT).We performed a retrospective cohort study to measure the independent association between intensity of antibiotic therapy, as measured by the antibiotic spectrum index (ASI), and hospital-associated CDI (HA-CDI) at a large academic medical center between January 2018 and March 2020. We constructed a marginal Poisson regression model to generate adjusted relative risks for a unit increase in ASI per antibiotic day.ASI was strongly associated with HA-CDI and could be a useful tool in evaluating the impact of antibiotic stewardship on HA-CDI rates, providing more granular information than the more commonly used days of therapy.We included 35,457 inpatient encounters in our cohort. Sixty-eight percent of patients received at least one antibiotic. We identified 128 HA-CDI cases, which corresponds to an incidence rate of 4.1 cases per 10,000 patient-days.

In response to unprecedented restrictions on human contact during the COVID-19 pandemic, studies measured social contact patterns under the implementation of physical distancing measures. This rapid review synthesizes empirical data on the changing social contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic.We identified 12 studies reporting social contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eight studies were conducted in European countries and eleven collected data during the initial mitigation period in the spring of 2020 marked by government-declared lockdowns. Some studies collected additional data after relaxation of initial mitigation. Most study settings reported a mean of between 2-5 contacts per person per day, a substantial reduction compared to pre-COVID rates, which ranged from 7-26 contacts per day. This reduction was pronounced for contacts outside of the home. Consequently, levels of assortative mixing by age substantially declined. After relaxation of initial mitigation, mean contact rates increased but did not return to pre-COVID levels. Increases in contacts post-relaxation were driven by working-age adults.Information on changes in contact patterns during physical distancing measures can guide more realistic representations of contact patterns in mathematical models for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.We conducted a systematic review using PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.

Despite many studies of specific host-pathogen systems, a unifying framework for predicting the outcomes of interactions among pathogens has remained elusive. We address this gap by developing a pathogen invasion theory (PIT) based on modern ecological coexistence theory and testing the resulting framework against empirical systems. Across major human pathogens, PIT predicts near-universal mutual susceptibility of one strain to invasion by another strain. However, predicting co-circulation from mutual invasion also depends on the degree to which susceptible abundance is reduced below the invasion threshold by overcompensatory epidemic dynamics, and the time it takes for susceptibles to replenish. The transmission advantage of an invading strain and the strength and duration of immunity are key determinants of susceptible dynamics. PIT unifies existing ideas about pathogen co-circulation, offering a quantitative framework for predicting the emergence of novel pathogen strains.","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","reference":"Park SW, Cobey S, Metcalf CJE, Levine JM, Grenfell BT.

A model that tracks microorganisms between compartments by coupled ordinary differential equations or a Markov chain is benchmarked against a mechanistic interpretation of the physical transfer of microorganisms from surfaces to fingers and subsequently to a susceptible person's facial mucosal membranes. The primary objective was to compare these models in their estimates of doses and changes in microorganism concentrations on hands and fomites over time. The abilities of the models to capture the impact of episodic events, such as hand hygiene, and of contact patterns were also explored. For both models, greater doses were estimated for the asymmetrical scenarios in which a more contaminated fomite was touched more often. Differing representations of hand hygiene in the Markov model did not notably impact estimated doses but affected pathogen concentration dynamics on hands. When using the Markov model, losses due to hand hygiene should be handled as separate events as opposed to time-averaging expected losses. The discrete event model demonstrated the effect of hand-to-mouth contact timing on the dose. Understanding how model design influences estimated doses is important for advancing models as reliable risk assessment tools.","journal":"Journal of the Royal Society, Interface","reference":"Wilson AM, Weir MH, King MF, Jones RM.

Understanding Drivers of Childhood and Adult Vaccination through a Multicountry Discrete Choice Experiment.","abstract":"Increased vaccine hesitancy and refusal negatively affects vaccine uptake, leading to the reemergence of vaccine preventable diseases. We aim to quantify the relative importance of factors people consider when making vaccine decisions for themselves, or for their child, with specific attention for underlying motives arising from context, such as required effort (accessibility) and opportunism (free riding on herd immunity). We documented attitudes towards vaccination and performed a discrete choice experiment in 4802 respondents in The United Kingdom, France and Belgium, eliciting preferences for six attributes: (1) vaccine effectiveness, (2) vaccine preventable disease burden, (3) vaccine accessibility in terms of copayment, vaccinator and administrative requirements, (4) frequency of mild vaccine-related side-effects, (5) vaccination coverage in the country's population and (6) local vaccination coverage in personal networks. We distinguished adults deciding on vaccination for themselves from parents deciding for their youngest child. While all attributes were found to be significant, vaccine effectiveness and accessibility stood out in all (sub)samples, followed by vaccine preventable disease burden. We confirmed that people attach more value to severity of disease compared to its frequency, and discovered that peer influence dominates free-rider motives, especially for the vaccination of children. These behavioral data are insightful for policy and are essential to parameterize dynamic vaccination behavior in simulation models. In contrast to what most game theoretical models assume, social norms dominate free-rider incentives. Policy-makers and healthcare workers should actively communicate on high vaccination coverage, and draw attention to the effectiveness of vaccines while optimizing their practical accessibility.","journal":"Vaccines","reference":"Verelst F, Kessels R, Willem L, Beutels P.

Genomic data, coupled with geographic information systems data, can further identify clusters or hotspots of malaria transmission, parasite genetic and spatial connectivity, and parasite movement by human or mosquito mobility over time and space. In this study, we performed longitudinal genomic surveillance in a cohort of 70 participants over four years from different neighborhoods and households in Thi\u00e8s, Senegal-a region of exceptionally low malaria transmission (entomological inoculation rate less than 1). Genetic identity (identity by state, IBS) was established using a 24-single nucleotide polymorphism molecular barcode, identity by descent was calculated from whole genome sequence data, and a hierarchical Bayesian regression model was used to establish genetic and spatial relationships. Our results show clustering of genetically similar parasites within households and a decline in genetic similarity of parasites with increasing distance. One household showed extremely high diversity and warrants further investigation as to the source of these diverse genetic types. This study illustrates the utility of genomic data with traditional epidemiological approaches for surveillance and detection of trends and patterns in malaria transmission not only by neighborhood but also by household. This approach can be implemented regionally and countrywide to strengthen and support malaria control and elimination efforts.","journal":"Scientific reports","reference":"Sy M, Deme AB, Warren JL, Early A, Schaffner S, Daniels RF, Dieye B, Ndiaye IM, Diedhiou Y, Mbaye AM, Volkman SK, Hartl DL, Wirth DF, Ndiaye D, Bei AK.

When children are vaccinated with PCVs, other serotypes that are not targeted by the vaccine can increase in frequency (serotype replacement) and reduce the direct and indirect benefits of the vaccine. To understand and predict the likely impacts of serotype replacement, it is important to know how patterns in the transmission of serotypes among children relate to disease rates in adults. We used data on pneumococcal carriage and disease from Navajo Nation children and adults collected before and after the routine use of PCVs (1998-2012). Using regression models within a Bayesian framework, we found that serotype-specific carriage and invasiveness (disease incidence divided by carriage prevalence) had similar patterns in children and adults. Moreover, carriage in children, invasiveness in children, and a serotype-specific random intercept (which captured additional variation associated with the serotypes) could predict the incidence serotype-specific pneumococcal disease in adults 18-39 years of age and those 40 years of age or older in the era of routine use of PCVs. These models could help us predict the effects of future pneumococcal vaccine use in children on disease rates in adults, and the modeling approach developed here could be used to test these findings in other settings.","journal":"American journal of epidemiology","reference":"Weinberger DM, Grant LR, Weatherholtz RC, Warren JL, O'Brien KL, Hammitt LL.

It may be of interest to develop a biologically intuitive model for the joint evolution of these outcomes while assessing inter-subject heterogeneity. Even though it is common for biological processes to entail non-linear relationships, examples of multivariate non-linear mixed models (MNMMs) are still fairly rare. We contribute to this area by jointly analyzing the maternal antibody decay for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, allowing for a different non-linear decay model for each infectious disease. We present a general modeling framework to analyze multivariate non-linear longitudinal profiles subject to censoring, by combining multivariate random effects, non-linear growth and Tobit regression. We explore the hypothesis of a common infant-specific mechanism underlying maternal immunity using a pairwise correlated random-effects approach and evaluating different correlation matrix structures. The implied marginal correlation between maternal antibody levels is estimated using simulations. The mean duration of passive immunity was less than 4 months for all diseases with substantial heterogeneity between infants. The maternal antibody levels against rubella and varicella were found to be positively correlated, while little to no correlation could be inferred for the other disease pairs. For some pairs, computational issues occurred with increasing correlation matrix complexity, which underlines the importance of further developing estimation methods for MNMMs.","journal":"Statistics in medicine","reference":"Goeyvaerts N, Leuridan E, Faes C, Van Damme P, Hens N.

In SSA, female and male youth (15 to 24 years) are at a disproportionately high risk of HIV infection compared to adults. As such, there is a need to target HIV prevention strategies to youth and to tailor them to a gender-specific context. This protocol describes the process for the multi-staged approach in the design of the MP3 Youth pilot study, a gender-specific, combination, HIV prevention intervention for youth in Kenya.The mixed-methods, cross-sectional, longitudinal cohort pilot study protocol was developed by first conducting a systematic review of the literature, which shaped focus group discussions around prevention package and delivery options, and that also informed age- and sex- stratified mathematical modeling. The review, qualitative data, and mathematical modeling created a triangulated evidence base of interventions to be included in the pilot study protocol. To design the pilot study protocol, we convened an expert panel to select HIV prevention interventions effective for youth in SSA, which will be offered in a mobile health setting. The goal of the pilot study implementation and evaluation is to apply lessons learned to more effective HIV prevention evidence and programming.The combination HIV prevention package in this protocol includes (1) offering HIV testing and counseling for all youth; (2) voluntary medical circumcision and condoms for males; (3) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), conditional cash transfer (CCT), and contraceptives for females; and (4) referrals for HIV care among those identified as HIV-positive. The combination package platform selected is mobile health teams in an integrated services delivery model. A cross-sectional analysis will be conducted to determine the uptake of the interventions. To determine long-term impact, the protocol outlines enrolling selected participants in mutually exclusive longitudinal cohorts (HIV-positive, PrEP, CCT, and HIV-negative) followed by using mobile phone text messages (short message service, SMS) and in-person surveys to prospectively assess prevention method uptake, adherence, and risk compensation behaviors. Cross-sectional and sub-cohort analyses will be conducted to determine intervention packages uptake.The literature review, focus groups, and modeling indicate that offering age- and gender- specific combination HIV prevention interventions that include biomedical, behavioral, and structural interventions can have an impact on HIV risk reduction. Implementing this protocol will show the feasibility of delivering these services at scale. The MP3 Youth study is one of the few combination HIV prevention intervention protocols incorporating youth- and gender-specific interventions in one delivery setting. Lessons learned from the design of the protocol can be incorporated into the national guidance for combination HIV prevention for youth in Kenya and other high-burden SSA settings.The objective of this multi-method protocol is to outline a rigorous and replicable methodology for a gender-specific combination HIV prevention pilot study for youth in high-burden settings, illustrating the triangulated methods undertaken to ensure that age, sex, and context are integral in the design of the intervention.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01571128; http:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT01571128?term=MP3+youth&rank=1 (Archived by WebCite at http:\/\/www.webcitation.org\/6nmioPd54).","journal":"JMIR research protocols","reference":"Buttolph J, Inwani I, Agot K, Cleland CM, Cherutich P, Kiarie JN, Osoti A, Celum CL, Baeten JM, Nduati R, Kinuthia J, Hallett TB, Alsallaq R, Kurth AE.

Because of the anticipated risk associated with L. monocytogenes and other pathogens in produce, immunocompromised individuals are often placed on neutropenic diets that exclude fresh produce, though these risks have not been quantified. Therefore, this study developed a data-driven risk model for listeriosis in cancer patients who consume ready-to-eat (RTE) salads, consisting of leafy greens, cucumbers, and tomatoes, as influenced by kitchen-scale treatments and storage practices. Monte Carlo simulations were used to model the risk of invasive listeriosis during one chemotherapy cycle. Refrigerating all salad components decreased the median risk by approximately one-half log. For refrigerated salads with no treatment, the predicted median risk was \u2264 4.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-08. When salad ingredients were surface blanched with greens rinsed, the predicted risk decreased to 5.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-10. Predicted risk was lowest (1.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-13) for a blanched \"salad\" consisting of solely cucumbers and tomatoes. Interestingly, rinsing, as recommended by FDA, only decreased the median risk by 1 log. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the highly variable dose-response parameter k strongly influenced risk, indicating that reducing uncertainty in this variable may improve model accuracy. Overall, this study demonstrates that kitchen-scale pathogen reduction approaches have high risk reduction efficacy and could be considered as an alternative to diets that exclude produce when making risk management decisions.","journal":"Journal of food protection","reference":"Gomez CB, Mitchell J, Ryser ET, Marks BP.

Early after vaccine roll-out, however, uncertainties about vaccine immunity raise the question of how much time is needed to estimate these properties, particularly the durability of vaccine protection. Here we designed a simulation study, based on a generic transmission model of vaccination, to simulate the impact of a breadth of vaccines with different mean (range: 10 months-2 years) and variability (coefficient of variation range: 50-100%) of the duration of protection. Focusing on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2\u2006in the year after start of mass immunization in Germany as a case study, we then assessed how confidently the duration of protection could be estimated under a range of epidemiological scenarios. We found that lower mean and higher heterogeneity facilitated estimation of the duration of vaccine protection. Across the vaccines tested, rapid waning and high heterogeneity permitted complete identification of the duration of protection; by contrast, slow waning and low heterogeneity allowed only estimation of the fraction of vaccinees with rapid loss of immunity.

We assessed age effects on transmissibility and the infectivity of COVID-19 cases during their incubation period.As of April 2, 2020, the global reported number of COVID-19 cases has crossed over 1 million with more than 55,000 deaths.

Fitting only with pre- and post-wave serological data during 2009 pandemic in Hong Kong, we demonstrate that with stratified immunity, the timing and the magnitude of the epidemic dynamics can be reconstructed more accurately than is possible with binary seropositivity data. We also show that increased infectiousness of children relative to adults and age-specific mixing are required to reproduce age-specific seroprevalence observed in Hong Kong, while pre-existing immunity in the elderly is not.

To test these hypotheses, we evaluated the host response to Lm in a mouse infection model and through mathematical modelling in a human population. After oral immunization with a murinized vA Lm strain, we demonstrated the elicitation of a CD8+ T-cell response and protection against subsequent challenge with an fV strain. A two-strain compartmental mathematical model of human exposure to Lm with cross-protective immunity was also developed. If food safety testing strategies preferentially identify and remove food contaminated by vA strains (potentially due to their common occurrence in foods and higher concentration in food compared to fV strains), the model predicted minimal public health benefit to potentially adverse effects. For example, reducing vA exposures by half, while maintaining fV exposures results in an approximately 6% rise in annual incidence.","journal":"Interface focus","reference":"Stout A, Van Stelten-Carlson A, Marquis H, Ballou M, Reilly B, Loneragan GH, Nightingale K, Ivanek R.

This has led to the discovery that many respiratory infections are caused by more than one virus. Antiviral treatment of viral coinfections can be complex because treatment of one virus will affect the time course of the other virus. Since effective antivirals are only available for some respiratory viruses, careful consideration needs to be given on the effect treating one virus will have on the dynamics of the other virus, which might not have available antiviral treatment. In this study, we use mathematical models of viral coinfections to assess the effect of antiviral treatment on coinfections. We examine the effect of the mechanism of action, relative growth rates of the viruses, and the assumptions underlying the interaction of the viruses. We find that high antiviral efficacy is needed to suppress both infections. If high doses of both antivirals are not achieved, then we run the risk of lengthening the duration of coinfection or even of allowing a suppressed virus to replicate to higher viral titers.","journal":"Epidemiologia (Basel, Switzerland)","reference":"Alexander P, Dobrovolny HM.

We show that the incidence of COVID-19 cases as of July 2020 can be explained by any combination of the late introduction of first imported cases, early implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), and low case detection rates. We then re-evaluate these findings in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic in Madagascar through August 2020. This analysis reinforces that Madagascar, along with other countries in SSA, remains at risk of a growing health crisis. If NPIs remain enforced, up to 50,000 lives may be saved.

Estimates of the potential impact of interventions and burden of disease are essential for policymakers to make evidence-based decisions on the distribution of limited resources and to balance the economic costs of interventions with the potential for saving lives.As of 13 January 2021, there have been 3\u2009113\u2009963 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 and 74\u2009619 deaths across the African continent.

The habitat preferences of host individuals affect their probability of exposure to pathogens. If preference behavior can be incorporated in ecological niche models (ENMs) when data on pathogen distributions are available, then variation in such behavior may dramatically impact exposure risk. Here we use data from the anthrax endemic system of Etosha National Park, Namibia, to demonstrate how integrating inferred movement behavior alters the construction of disease risk maps. We used a Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model that associated soil, bioclimatic, and vegetation variables with the best available pathogen presence data collected at anthrax carcass sites to map areas of most likely Bacillus anthracis (the causative bacterium of anthrax) persistence. We then used a hidden Markov model (HMM) to distinguish foraging and non-foraging behavioral states along the movement tracks of nine zebra (Equus quagga) during the 2009 and 2010 anthrax seasons. The resulting tracks, decomposed on the basis of the inferred behavioral state, formed the basis of step-selection functions (SSFs) that used the MaxEnt output as a potential predictor variable. Our analyses revealed different risks of exposure during different zebra behavioral states, which were obscured when the full movement tracks were analyzed without consideration of the underlying behavioral states of individuals. Pathogen (or vector) distribution models may be misleading with regard to the actual risk faced by host animal populations when specific behavioral states are not explicitly accounted for in selection analyses. To more accurately evaluate exposure risk, especially in the case of environmentally transmitted pathogens, selection functions could be built for each identified behavioral state and then used to assess the comparative exposure risk across relevant states. The scale of data collection and analysis, however, introduces complexities and limitations for consideration when interpreting results.","journal":"Movement ecology","reference":"Dougherty ER, Seidel DP, Blackburn JK, Turner WC, Getz WM.

Cheaper and faster alternatives, such as antigen and paper-strip tests, have been proposed. They return results rapidly, but have lower sensitivity thresholds for detecting virus. To quantify the effects of the tradeoffs between sensitivity, cost, testing frequency, and delay in test return on the overall course of an outbreak, we built a multi-scale immuno-epidemiological model that connects the virus profile of infected individuals with transmission and testing at the population level. We investigated various randomized testing strategies and found that, for fixed testing capacity, lower sensitivity tests with shorter return delays slightly flatten the daily incidence curve and delay the time to the peak daily incidence. However, compared with RT-PCR testing, they do not always reduce the cumulative case count at half a year into the outbreak. When testing frequency is increased to account for the lower cost of less sensitive tests, we observe a large reduction in cumulative case counts, from 55.4% to as low as 1.22% half a year into the outbreak. The improvement is preserved even when the testing budget is reduced by one half or one third. Our results predict that surveillance testing that employs low-sensitivity tests at high frequency is an effective tool for epidemic control.","journal":"Viruses","reference":"Forde JE, Ciupe SM.

Acute-phase ancestral spike RBD bAb levels associated with 50% lower odds of COVID-19 were 1968 BAU\/mL against Delta and 3375 BAU\/mL against Omicron; thresholds may differ in other laboratories.We assessed associations between binding antibody (bAb) concentration <5 days from symptom onset and testing positive for COVID-19 among patients in a test-negative study.During acute illness, antibody concentrations against ancestral spike RBD were associated with protection against COVID-19.","journal":"The Journal of infectious diseases","reference":"Sumner KM, Yadav R, Noble EK, Sandford R, Joshi D, Tartof SY, Wernli KJ, Martin ET, Gaglani M, Zimmerman RK, Talbot HK, Grijalva CG, Belongia EA, Chung JR, Rogier E, Coughlin MM, Flannery B.

When model populations are stratified, contacts among their respective sub-populations must be described. Using a simple meta-population model, Feng et al. (2015) showed that mixing among sub-populations, as well as heterogeneity in characteristics affecting sub-population reproduction numbers, must be considered when evaluating public health interventions to prevent or control infectious disease outbreaks. They employed the convex combination of preferential within- and proportional among-group contacts first described by Nold (1980) and subsequently generalized by Jacquez et al. (1988). As the utility of meta-population modeling depends on more realistic mixing functions, the authors added preferential contacts between parents and children and among co-workers (Glasser et al., 2012). Here they further generalize this function by including preferential contacts between grandparents and grandchildren, but omit workplace contacts. They also describe a general multi-level mixing scheme, provide three two-level examples, and apply two of them. In their first application, the authors describe age- and gender-specific patterns in face-to-face conversations (Mossong et al., 2008), proxies for contacts by which respiratory pathogens might be transmitted, that are consistent with everyday experience. This suggests that meta-population models with inter-generational mixing could be employed to evaluate prolonged school-closures, a proposed pandemic mitigation measure that could expose grandparents, and other elderly surrogate caregivers for working parents, to infectious children. In their second application, the authors use a meta-population SEIR model stratified by 7 age groups and 50 states plus the District of Columbia, to compare actual with optimal vaccination during the 2009-2010 influenza pandemic in the United States. They also show that vaccination efforts could have been adjusted month-to-month during the fall of 2009 to ensure maximum impact. Such applications inspire confidence in the reliability of meta-population modeling in support of public health policymaking.","journal":"Mathematical biosciences","reference":"Feng Z, Hill AN, Curns AT, Glasser JW.

Outbreaks of zoonotic pathogens often occur at these ecological boundaries, but the mechanisms behind new emergences remain drastically understudied. Here, we test for the influence of two types of ecosystem boundaries on spillover risk: (1) biotic transition zones such as species range edges and transitions between ecoregions and (2) land use transition zones where wild landscapes occur in close proximity to heavily impacted areas of high human population density. Using ebolavirus as a model system and an ensemble machine learning modeling framework, we investigated the role of likely reservoir (bats) and accidental host (primates) range edges and patterns of land use (defined using SEDAC categories) on past spillover events. Our results show that overlapping species range edges and heightened habitat diversity increase ebolavirus outbreaks risk. Moreover, we show that gradual transition zones, represent by high proportion of rangelands, acts as a buffer to reduces outbreak risks. With increasing landscape changes worldwide, we provide novel ecological and evolutionary insights into our understanding of zoonotic pathogen emergence and highlight the risk of aggressively developing ecological boundaries.","journal":"Frontiers in public health","reference":"Filion A, Sundaram M, Schmidt JP, Drake JM, Stephens PR.

Yeast prion systems are intrinsically multi-scale: the molecular chemical processes are indeed coupled to the cellular processes of cell growth and division to influence phenotypical traits, observable at the scale of colonies. We introduce a novel modeling framework to tackle this difficulty using impulsive differential equations. We apply this approach to the [PSI+] yeast prion, which is associated with the misconformation and aggregation of Sup35. We build a model that reproduces and unifies previously conflicting experimental observations on [PSI+] and thus sheds light onto characteristics of the intracellular molecular processes driving aggregate replication. In particular our model uncovers a kinetic barrier for aggregate replication at low densities, meaning the change between prion or prion-free phenotype is a bi-stable transition. This result is based on the study of prion curing experiments, as well as the phenomenon of colony sectoring, a phenotype which is often ignored in experimental assays and has never been modeled. Furthermore, our results provide further insight into the effect of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) on Sup35 aggregates. To qualitatively reproduce the GdnHCl curing experiment, aggregate replication must not be completely inhibited, which suggests the existence of a mechanism different than Hsp104-mediated fragmentation. Those results are promising for further development of the [PSI+] model, but also for extending the use of this novel framework to other yeast prion or amyloid systems.","journal":"PLoS computational biology","reference":"Lemarre P, Pujo-Menjouet L, Sindi SS.

We estimated trends and differences in tuberculosis incidence rates for the non-U.S.-born population, at a resolution unobtainable from raw data. We obtained non-U.S.-born tuberculosis case reports for 2000-2016 from the National Tuberculosis Surveillance System, and population data from the American Community Survey and 2000 U.S. Census. We constructed generalized additive regression models to estimate incidence rates in terms of birth country, entry year, age at entry, and number of years since entry into the United States and described how these factors contribute to overall tuberculosis risk. Controlling for other factors, tuberculosis incidence rates were lower for more recent immigration cohorts, with an incidence risk ratio (IRR) of 10.2 (95 % confidence interval 7.0, 14.7) for the 1950 entry cohort compared to its 2016 counterpart. Greater years since entry and younger age at entry were associated with substantially lower incidence rates. IRRs for birth country varied between 8.86 (6.78, 11.52) for Somalia and 0.02 (0.01, 0.03) for Canada, compared to all non-U.S.-born residents in 2016. IRRs were positively correlated with WHO predicted incidence rate and negatively associated with wealth level for the birth country. Lower country wealth level was also associated with shallower declines in tuberculosis over time. Tuberculosis risks differ by several orders of magnitude within the non-U.S.-born population. A better understanding of these differences will allow more effective targeting of tuberculosis prevention efforts.

Soil predictors included soil texture (per cent sand, silt and clay), pH, electrical conductivity and water storage capacity; climactic predictors included mean annual air temperature and liquid precipitation. Clustering was evaluated with Moran's I, and four modelling approaches were adopted a priori: two models without any smoothing (logistic regression and quasi-logistic regression) and two smoothing models (non-spatial and spatial smoothing). No evidence was found for clustering, and both smoothing models resulted in marked attenuation of all coefficients. Temperature was found to have a positive effect in the non-smoothing models (prevalence odds ratio, logistic model: 1.70, 95% confidence interval 1.02, 2.84). While no other significant associations were found, there was suggestive evidence of a positive effect for pH.

Such tools are critical for providing timely information to assist healthcare authorities in preparing human, material, and medical resources for outbreaks. Here, we investigate associations between meteorological variables and dengue transmission in the Dominican Republic in 2019, the year in which the country\u2019s largest outbreak to date ocurred. We apply generalized linear mixed modelling with gamma family and log link to model the weekly dengue incidence rate. Because correlations in lags between climate variables and dengue cases exhibited different behaviour among provinces, a backward-type selection method was executed to find a final model with lags in the explanatory variables.

Impact estimates reported in this manuscript were used to inform the Gavi VIS.We compared two independent vaccine impact models to evaluate a potential maternal RSV vaccine's impact on infant health in 73 Gavi-supported countries.

A simulation study shows that BETR outperforms an existing method that ignores patient-level variation in progression rates. BETR, when combined with a common Bayesian model comparison tool, can identify the correct disease progression function nearly 100% of the time, with high accuracy in estimating the individual disease durations and progression rates. Application of BETR in patients with geographic atrophy, a disease with a known natural history model, shows that it can identify the correct disease progression model.

Pneumococcus serotype co-colonization, caused by the polymorphic bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, has been increasingly investigated and reported in recent years. While the global genomic diversity and serotype distribution of S. pneumoniae have been well-characterized, there is limited information on how co-colonization patterns vary globally, critical for understanding the evolution and transmission dynamics of the bacteria. Gathering a rich dataset of cross-sectional pneumococcal colonization studies in the literature, we quantified patterns of transmission intensity and co-colonization prevalence variation in children populations across 17 geographic locations. Fitting these data to an SIS model with cocolonization under the assumption of quasi-neutrality among multiple interacting strains, our analysis reveals strong patterns of negative co-variation between transmission intensity (R0) and susceptibility to co-colonization (k). In line with expectations from the stress-gradient-hypothesis in ecology (SGH), pneumococcus serotypes appear to compete more in co-colonization in high-transmission settings and compete less in low-transmission settings, a trade-off which ultimately leads to a conserved ratio of single to co-colonization \u03bc=1\/(R0-1)k. As expected from the mathematical model's behavior, such conservation suggests preservation of 'stability-diversity-complexity' regimes in coexistence of similar co-colonizing strains. We find no major differences in serotype compositions across studies, pointing to adaptation of the same set of serotypes across variable environments as an explanation for their differential interaction in different transmission settings. Our work highlights that the understanding of transmission patterns of Streptococcus pneumoniae from global scale epidemiological data can benefit from simple analytical approaches that account for quasi-neutrality among strains, co-colonization, as well as variable environmental adaptation.","journal":"Theoretical population biology","reference":"Dekaj E, Gjini E.

Rates however show a statistically significant increase over time in children aged 0-3 years, and a decline in older individuals. A significant increase in day-care enrolment and structures' capacity in France was also observed in the last decade. In this work we investigate the potential interplay between an increase of contacts of young children possibly caused by earlier socialization in the community and varicella transmission dynamics. To this aim, we develop an age-structured mathematical model, informed with historical demographic data and contact matrix estimates in the country, accounting for longitudinal linear increase of early childhood contacts. While the reported overall varicella incidence is well reproduced independently of mixing variations, age-specific empirical trends are better captured by accounting for an increase in contacts among pre-school children in the last decades. We found that the varicella data are consistent with a 30% increase in the number of contacts at day-care facilities, which would imply a 50% growth in the contribution of 0-3y old children to overall yearly infections in 1991-2015.

Rates increased significantly post intervention (P<0.001) for HPV initiation which increased 17.1 percentage points (PP) from 51.4%; HPV completion increased 14.8PP from 30.7%, meningococcal vaccine uptake increased 16.6PP from 79.1%, Tdap vaccine uptake increased 14.6PP from 76.9%. Influenza vaccine uptake did not increase significantly (2.3PP from 40.1%). In the regression using generalized estimating equations, odds of vaccination were higher for younger, non-white adolescents for all vaccines; being in a smaller practice decreased the odds of Tdap vaccination but increased the odds of influenza vaccination.Eleven pediatric and family medicine practices, previously control sites from a randomized controlled cluster trial, with \u226550 adolescent patients participated.

We assume that future seasonal transmission patterns for COVID-19 will be similar to those of influenza virus. We account for the waning of infection-induced immunity and vaccine-induced immunity in a future with stable COVID-19 dynamics. Due to uncertainty in the duration of immunity following vaccination or infection, we consider two exponentially-distributed waning rates, with means of 365 days (one year) and 548 days (1.5 years). We also consider treatment failure, including rebound frequency, as a possible treatment outcome.As expected, universal vaccination is projected to eliminate transmission and mortality. Under current treatment coverage (13.7%) and vaccination coverage (49%), averages of 89,000 annual deaths (548-day waning) and 120,000 annual deaths (365-day waning) are expected by the end of this decade. Annual mortality in the United States can be reduced below 50,000 per year with >81% annual vaccination coverage, and below 10,000 annual deaths with >84% annual vaccination coverage. Universal treatment reduces hospitalizations by 88% and deaths by 93% under current vaccination coverage. A reduction in vaccination coverage requires a comparatively larger increase in treatment coverage in order for hospitalization and mortality levels to remain unchanged.As we enter the fourth year of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 infections still cause high morbidity and mortality in the United States. During 2020-2022, COVID-19 was one of the leading causes of death in the United States and by far the leading cause among infectious diseases. Vaccination uptake remains low despite this being an effective burden reducing intervention. The development of COVID-19 therapeutics provides hope for mitigating severe clinical outcomes. This modeling study examines combined strategies of vaccination and treatment to reduce the burden of COVID-19 epidemics over the next decade.Adopting universal vaccination and universal treatment goals in the United States will likely lead to a COVID-19 mortality burden below 50,000 deaths per year, a burden comparable to that of influenza virus.","journal":"medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences","reference":"Yang F, Tran TN, Howerton E, Boni MF, Servadio JL.

In vivo, leading row mesendoderm cells extend polarized protrusions and migrate along a fibronectin matrix assembled by blastocoel roof cells. Traction stresses generated at the leading row result in the pulling forward of attached follower row cells. Mesendoderm explants removed from embryos provide an experimentally tractable system for characterizing collective cell movements and behaviors, yet the cellular mechanisms responsible for this mode of migration remain elusive. We introduce a novel agent-based computational model of migrating mesendoderm in the Cellular-Potts computational framework to investigate the respective contributions of multiple parameters specific to the behaviors of leader and follower row cells. Sensitivity analyses identify cohesotaxis, tissue geometry, and cell intercalation as key parameters affecting the migration velocity of collectively migrating cells. The model predicts that cohesotaxis and tissue geometry in combination promote cooperative migration of leader cells resulting in increased migration velocity of the collective. Radial intercalation of cells towards the substrate is an additional mechanism contributing to an increase in migratory speed of the tissue. Model outcomes are validated experimentally using mesendoderm tissue explants.","journal":"Biology open","reference":"Comlekoglu T, Dzamba BJ, Pacheco GG, Shook DR, Sego TJ, Glazier JA, Peirce SM, DeSimone DW.

As our awareness of viral coinfections has increased, researchers have started to experimentally examine some of the virus-virus interactions underlying these infections. One mechanism of interaction between viruses is through the innate immune response. This seems to occur primarily through the interferon response, which generates an antiviral state in nearby uninfected cells, a phenomenon know as the bystander effect. Here, we develop a mathematical model of two viruses interacting through the bystander effect. We find that when the rate of removal of cells to the protected state is high, growth of the first virus is suppressed, while the second virus enjoys sole access to the protected cells, enhancing its growth. Conversely, growth of the second virus can be fully suppressed if its ability to infect the protected cells is limited.","journal":"Journal of theoretical biology","reference":"Noffel Z, Dobrovolny H.

Questions were included on demographic and trip details, malaria risk behaviour, children accompanying travellers, and mobile phone usage to enable phone signal data to be better correlated with movement. A total of 4352 individuals were interviewed and 6411 trips recorded.Women travelling with children were a remarkably consistent traveller group across all four countries surveyed. They are expected to contribute greatly towards spatial malaria transmission because the children they travel with tend to have high parasite prevalence. Youth workers were a significant traveller group in Mali and are expected to contribute greatly to spatial malaria transmission because their movements correlate with seasonal rains and hence peak mosquito densities. Interventions aimed at interrupting spatial transmission of parasites should consider these traveller groups.As malaria prevalence declines in many parts of the world due to widescale control efforts and as drug-resistant parasites begin to emerge, a quantitative understanding of human movement is becoming increasingly relevant to malaria control. However, despite its importance, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding human movement, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.A cluster analysis of trips highlighted two distinct traveller groups of relevance to malaria transmission: women travelling with children (in all four countries) and youth workers (in Mali). Women travelling with children were more likely to travel to areas of relatively high malaria prevalence in Mali (OR = 4.46, 95% CI = 3.42-5.83), Burkina Faso (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.23-1.58), Zambia (OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.20-1.89), and Tanzania (OR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.71-3.05) compared to other travellers.

Epidemic forecasts can be valuable for targeting highest risk populations before an outbreak. The two main barriers to routine use of real-time forecasts include scientific and operational challenges. First, accuracy may be limited by availability of data and the uncertainty associated with the inherently stochastic processes that determine when and where outbreaks happen and spread. Second, even if data are available, the appropriate channels of communication may prevent their use for decision making.In April 2019, only six weeks after Cyclone Idai devastated Mozambique's central region and sparked a cholera outbreak, Cyclone Kenneth severely damaged northern areas of the country. By June 10, a total of 267 cases of cholera were confirmed, sparking a vaccination campaign. Prior to Kenneth's landfall, a team of academic researchers, humanitarian responders, and health agencies developed a simple model to forecast areas at highest risk of a cholera outbreak. The model created risk indices for each district using combinations of four metrics: (1) flooding data; (2) previous annual cholera incidence; (3) sensitivity of previous outbreaks to the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation cycle; and (4) a diffusion (gravity) model to simulate movement of infected travelers. As information on cases became available, the risk model was continuously updated. A web-based tool was produced, which identified highest risk populations prior to the cyclone and the districts at-risk following the start of the outbreak.The model prior to Kenneth's arrival using the metrics of previous incidence, projected flood, and El Ni\u00f1o sensitivity accurately predicted areas at highest risk for cholera. Despite this success, not all data were available at the scale at which the vaccination campaign took place, limiting the model's utility, and the extent to which the forecasts were used remains unclear. Here, the science behind these forecasts and the organizational structure of this collaborative effort are discussed. The barriers to the routine use of forecasts in crisis settings are highlighted, as well as the potential for flexible teams to rapidly produce actionable insights for decision making using simple modeling tools, both before and during an outbreak.","journal":"Prehospital and disaster medicine","reference":"Kahn R, Mahmud AS, Schroeder A, Aguilar Ramirez LH, Crowley J, Chan J, Buckee CO.

Lower coverage had correspondingly lower effectiveness, as did reactive campaigns. Though less effective than preventative campaigns, reactive and even post-epidemic interventions retain some effectiveness; these campaigns disrupt inter-seasonal transmission, highlighting an off-season control opportunity. Regardless, none of the campaign scenarios maintain their initial effectiveness beyond two seasons, instead stabilizing at much lower levels of benefit: in year 20, median effectiveness was only 27.3% (IQR: [-21.3%, 56.6%]). Furthermore, simply ceasing an initially successful program exposes a population with lowered herd immunity to the same historical threat, and we observed outbreaks more than four-fold larger than pre-intervention outbreaks. These results do not take into account evolving insecticide resistance, thus long-term effectiveness may be lower if new, efficacious insecticides are not developed.Using a detailed agent-based dengue transmission model for Yucat\u00e1n State, Mexico, we predict that high coverage indoor residual spraying (IRS) interventions can largely eliminate transmission for a few years, when applied a few months before the typical seasonal epidemic peak. However, vector control succeeds by preventing infections, which precludes natural immunization. Thus, as a population benefits from mosquito control, it gradually loses naturally acquired herd immunity, and the control effectiveness declines; this occurs across all of our modeled scenarios, and is consistent with other empirical work. Long term control that maintains early effectiveness would require some combination of increasing investment, complementary interventions such as vaccination, and control programs across a broad region to diminish risk of importation.Historically, mosquito control programs successfully helped contain malaria and yellow fever, but recent efforts have been unable to halt the spread of dengue, chikungunya, or Zika, all transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Using a dengue transmission model and results from indoor residual spraying (IRS) field experiments, we investigated how IRS-like campaign scenarios could effectively control dengue in an endemic setting.","journal":"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","reference":"Hladish TJ, Pearson CAB, Patricia Rojas D, Gomez-Dantes H, Halloran ME, Vazquez-Prokopec GM, Longini IM.

Trends by age and birth cohort were modeled using negative binomial regression and change-point methods. To evaluate possible explanations for changes, these trends were compared to changes in HPV vaccination coverage, cervical cancer screening, an antecedent event to detection of a high-grade lesion, and changes in sexual behaviors and Chlamydia trachomatis, an infection with similar epidemiology to and shared risk factors for HPV.A significant decline in CIN2+ was first evident among women aged 21 years in 2010, followed by successive declines in women aged 22-26 years during 2011-2012. During 2008-2015, the rates of CIN2+ declined by 30%-74% among women aged 21-26 years, with greater declines observed in the younger women. Birth cohorts between 1985 and 1994 all experienced significant declines during the surveillance period, ranging from 25% to 82%. Ecological comparisons revealed substantial increases in HPV vaccination during this time period, and more modest reductions in cervical cancer screening and sexual risk behaviors.Trends in human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical lesions can provide an indication of vaccine impact. Our purpose was to measure trends in cervical lesions during 2008-2015 and to consider possible explanations including vaccination coverage, changes in screening for cervical cancer, and risk behaviors for acquiring HPV.The age and cohort patterns in our data suggest that declines in CIN2+ during 2008-2015 are more likely driven by HPV vaccination, introduced in 2006, than by changes in screening or risk behavior.","journal":"Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America","reference":"Niccolai LM, Meek JI, Brackney M, Hadler JL, Sosa LE, Weinberger DM.

This highlights the importance of initiating a nationwide vaccination programme while such prices are still available.Cervical cancer is currently the leading cause of cancer mortality among women in South Vietnam and the second leading cause of cancer mortality in North Vietnam. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has the potential to substantially decrease this burden. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that a cost-effectiveness analysis of HPV vaccination is conducted before nationwide introduction.The cost of cervical cancer treatment ranged from US$368 - 11400 depending on the type of hospital and treatment involved. Under Gavi-negotiated prices of US$4.55, HPV vaccination is likely to be very cost-effective with an incremental cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted in the range US$780 - 1120. However, under list prices for Cervarix and Gardasil in Vietnam, the incremental cost per DALY averted for HPV vaccination can exceed US$8000.The Papillomavirus Rapid Interface for Modeling and Economics (PRIME) model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccine introduction. A costing study based on expert panel discussions, interviews and hospital case note reviews was conducted to explore the cost of cervical cancer care.","journal":"BMC health services research","reference":"Van Minh H, My NTT, Jit M.

These results provide an explanation for decreasing acquisition rates in VA hospitals since the MRSA Prevention Initiative.In this cohort study of 108 VA hospitals, more than 2 million unique individuals had over 5.6 million admissions, of which 14.1% were presumed to have contact precautions with more than 8.4 million MRSA surveillance tests. Pooled estimates found associations between contact precautions and transmission to be stable from 2008 to 2017, with estimated transmission reductions ranging from 43% (95% credible interval [CrI], 38%-48%) to 51% (95% CrI, 46%-55%). Over the entire 10-year study period, contact precautions reduced transmission 47% (95% CrI, 45%-49%), and the intrafacility autocorrelation coefficient estimate was 0.99, suggesting consistent estimates over time within facilities. Larger facilities and those with higher admission screening compliance observed additional reductions in transmission associated with contact precautions (relative rate, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74-0.96 and 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58-0.96, respectively) compared with smaller facilities and those with lower admission screening compliance.

This study examined the association between geographic access to radiation therapy facilities and receipt of breast cancer treatments among early-stage breast cancer patients in South Dakota. Based on 4,209 early-stage breast cancer patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2012 in South Dakota, the study measured geographic proximity to radiation therapy facilities using the shortest travel time for patients to the closest radiation therapy facility. Two-level logistic regression models were used to estimate for early stage cases i) the odds of mastectomy versus breast conserving surgery (BCS); ii) the odds of not receiving radiation therapy after BCS versus receiving follow-up radiation therapy. Covariates included race\/ethnicity, age at diagnosis, tumour grade, tumour sequence, year of diagnosis, census tract-level poverty rate and urban\/rural residence. The spatial scan statistic method was used to identify geographic areas with significantly higher likelihood of experiencing mastectomy. The study found that geographic accessibility to radiation therapy facilities was negatively associated with the likelihood of receiving mastectomy after adjustment for other covariates, but not associated with radiation therapy use among patients receiving BCS. Compared with patients travelling less than 30 minutes to a radiation therapy facility, patients travelling more than 90 minutes were about 1.5 times more likely to receive mastectomy (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.11) and patients travelling more than 120 minutes were 1.7 times more likely to receive mastectomy (odds ratio, 1.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-2.42). The study also identified a statistically significant cluster of patients receiving mastectomy who were located in south-eastern South Dakota, after adjustment for other factors. Because geographic proximity to treatment facilities plays an important role on the treatment for early-stage breast cancer patients, this study has important implications for developing targeted intervention to reduce disparities in breast cancer treatment in South Dakota.","journal":"Geospatial health","reference":"Lin Y, Wimberly MC, Da Rosa P, Hoover J, Athas WF.

We did a systematic review of studies on chikungunya seroprevalence and fitted catalytic models to each survey to estimate location-specific FOI (ie, the rate at which susceptible individuals acquire chikungunya infection). We performed a meta-analysis to estimate the proportion of symptomatic patients with laboratory-confirmed chikungunya who had chronic chikungunya or were admitted to hospital following infection. We used a random-effects model to assess the relationship between chronic sequelae and follow-up length using linear regression. The systematic review protocol is registered online on PROSPERO, CRD42022363102.Chikungunya is an arboviral disease transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes with a growing global burden linked to climate change and globalisation. We aimed to estimate chikungunya seroprevalence, force of infection (FOI), and prevalence of related chronic disability and hospital admissions in endemic and epidemic settings.We inferred subnational heterogeneity in long-term average annual FOI and transmission dynamics and identified both endemic and epidemic settings across different countries. Brazil, Ethiopia, Malaysia, and India included both endemic and epidemic settings. Long-term average annual FOI was higher in epidemic settings than endemic settings. However, long-term cumulative incidence of chikungunya can be similar between large outbreaks in epidemic settings with a high FOI and endemic settings with a relatively low FOI.International Vaccine Institute.We identified 60 studies with data on seroprevalence and chronic chikungunya symptoms done across 76 locations in 38 countries, and classified 17 (22%) of 76 locations as endemic settings and 59 (78%) as epidemic settings. The global long-term median annual FOI was 0\u00b7007 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 0\u00b7003-0\u00b7010) and varied from 0\u00b70001 (0\u00b700004-0\u00b70002) to 0\u00b7113 (0\u00b707-0\u00b720).

We find that marked, asynchronous reductions of the basic reproductive number occurred throughout the United States in association with social distancing and other control measures. Counterfactual simulations indicate that, had these same measures been implemented 1 to 2 weeks earlier, substantial cases and deaths could have been averted and that delayed responses to future increased incidence will facilitate a stronger rebound of infections and death.

We compared the performance of quarantines of differing durations, testing with either PCR or lateral flow antigen (LFA) tests at the end of quarantine, and daily LFA testing without quarantine, against the current 14-day quarantine strategy. We also investigated the effect of contact tracing delays and adherence to both quarantine and self-isolation on the effectiveness of each strategy.National Institute for Health Research, UK Research and Innovation, Wellcome Trust, EU Horizon 2021, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.In most countries, contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases are asked to quarantine for 14 days after exposure to limit asymptomatic onward transmission. While theoretically effective, this policy places a substantial social and economic burden on both the individual and wider society, which might result in low adherence and reduced policy effectiveness. We aimed to assess the merit of testing contacts to avert onward transmission and to replace or reduce the length of quarantine for uninfected contacts.Assuming moderate levels of adherence to quarantine and self-isolation, self-isolation on symptom onset alone can prevent 37% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 12-56) of onward transmission potential from secondary cases. 14 days of post-exposure quarantine reduces transmission by 59% (95% UI 28-79). Quarantine with release after a negative PCR test 7 days after exposure might avert a similar proportion (54%, 95% UI 31-81; risk ratio [RR] 0\u00b794, 95% UI 0\u00b762-1\u00b724) to that of the 14-day quarantine period, as would quarantine with a negative LFA test 7 days after exposure (50%, 95% UI 28-77; RR 0\u00b788, 0\u00b766-1\u00b711) or daily testing without quarantine for 5 days after tracing (50%, 95% UI 23-81; RR 0\u00b788, 0\u00b760-1\u00b743) if all tests are returned negative. A stronger effect might be possible if individuals isolate more strictly after a positive test and if contacts can be notified faster.Testing might allow for a substantial reduction in the length of, or replacement of, quarantine with a small excess in transmission risk. Decreasing test and trace delays and increasing adherence will further increase the effectiveness of these strategies. Further research is required to empirically evaluate the potential costs (increased transmission risk, false reassurance) and benefits (reduction in the burden of quarantine, increased adherence) of such strategies before adoption as policy.","journal":"The Lancet.

Linear regression models were used to estimate the effects of public trust and strictness of restriction measures on people's compliance level. The model accounted for individual and daily variations in country-level stringency of preventative measures. Differences in the dynamics between public trust, the stringent level of government health guidelines and policy compliance were also examined among countries based on political regimes.We find strong evidence of the increase in compliance due to the imposition of stricter government restrictions. The examination of heterogeneous effects suggests that high public trust in government and the perception of its truthfulness double the impact of policy restrictions on public compliance. Among political regimes, higher levels of public trust significantly increase the predicted compliance as stringency level rises in authoritarian and democratic countries.","journal":"Risk management and healthcare policy","reference":"Pak A, McBryde E, Adegboye OA.

The Ethiopian National Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) and the Global Vaccine Action Plan set coverage goals of 90% at national level and 80% at district level by 2020. This study analyses full vaccination coverage among children in Ethiopia and estimates the equity impact by socioeconomic, geographic, maternal and child characteristics based on the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey dataset.Vaccination coverage in Ethiopia has a pro-advantaged regressive distribution with respect to both household wealth and maternal education. Children from poorer households, rural regions of Afar and Somali, no maternal education, and female-headed households had lower full vaccination coverage. Targeted programmes to reach under-immunised children in these subpopulations will improve vaccination coverage and equity outcomes in Ethiopia.Full vaccination coverage was 33.3% [29.4-37.2] in 2016. Single vaccination coverage ranged from 49.1% [45.1-53.1] for PCV3 to 69.2% [65.5-72.8] for BCG. Wealth and maternal education related inequities were pronounced with concentration indices of 0.30 and 0.23 respectively. Children in Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa were seven times more likely to have full vaccination compared to children living in the Afar region.

Effect estimates of the individual indicators were calculated with univariate models. Presence of spatial autocorrelation was established using Moran's I statistic. Spatial simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models that account for spatial autocorrelation in response and predictors were used to assess (i) the proportion of variance in county-level COVID-19 mortality that can explained by identified health\/socioeconomic indicators (R2); and (ii) effect estimates of each predictor. Adjusting for case rates, the selected indicators individually explain 24%-29% of the variability in mortality. Prevalence of chronic kidney disease and proportion of population residing in nursing homes have the highest R2. Mortality is estimated to increase by 43 per thousand residents (95% CI: 37-49; p < 0.001) with a 1% increase in the prevalence of chronic kidney disease and by 39 deaths per thousand (95% CI: 34-44; p < 0.001) with 1% increase in population living in nursing homes. SAR models using multiple health\/socioeconomic indicators explain 43% of the variability in COVID-19 mortality in US counties, adjusting for case rates. R2 was found to be not sensitive to the choice of SAR model form. Study limitations include the use of mortality rates that are not age standardized, a spatial adjacency matrix that does not capture human flows among counties, and insufficient accounting for interaction among predictors.With the availability of multiple Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines and the predicted shortages in supply for the near future, it is necessary to allocate vaccines in a manner that minimizes severe outcomes, particularly deaths. To date, vaccination strategies in the United States have focused on individual characteristics such as age and occupation. Here, we assess the utility of population-level health and socioeconomic indicators as additional criteria for geographical allocation of vaccines.Significant spatial autocorrelation exists in COVID-19 mortality in the US, and population health\/socioeconomic indicators account for a considerable variability in county-level mortality. In the context of vaccine rollout in the US and globally, national and subnational estimates of burden of disease could inform optimal geographical allocation of vaccines.","journal":"PLoS medicine","reference":"Kandula S, Shaman J.

However, estimates from observational studies can be confounded by unrelated changes in healthcare utilization, changes in the underlying health of the population, or changes in reporting. Other diseases are often used to detect and adjust for these changes, but choosing an appropriate control disease a priori is a major challenge. The \"synthetic controls\" (causal impact) method, which was originally developed for website analytics and social sciences, provides an appealing solution. With this approach, potential comparison time series are combined into a composite and are used to generate a counterfactual estimate, which can be compared with the time series of interest after the intervention. We sought to estimate changes in hospitalizations for all-cause pneumonia associated with the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) in five countries in the Americas. Using synthetic controls, we found a substantial decline in hospitalizations for all-cause pneumonia in infants in all five countries (average of 20%), whereas estimates for young and middle-aged adults varied by country and were potentially influenced by the 2009 influenza pandemic. In contrast to previous reports, we did not detect a decline in all-cause pneumonia in older adults in any country.

Establishing whether surveillance practices or differences in infection severity account for gaps between observed and expected mortality is of crucial importance to establishing the burden of COVID-19 in India.In this prospective, active surveillance study, we used data collected under expanded programmatic surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the district of Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India (population of 3\u2009266\u2009000 individuals). Prospective testing via RT-PCR was done in individuals with fever or acute respiratory symptoms as well as returning travellers, frontline workers, contacts of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, residents of containment zones, patients undergoing medical procedures, and other risk groups. Standardised data collection on symptoms and chronic comorbid conditions was done as part of routine intake. Additionally, seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G was assessed via a cross-sectional survey recruiting adults across 38 clusters within Madurai District from Oct 19, 2020, to Nov 5, 2020. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for positive RT-PCR results comparing individuals by age, sex, comorbid conditions, and aspects of clinical presentation. We estimated case-fatality ratios (CFRs) over the 30-day period following RT-PCR testing stratified by the same variables, and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for death associated with age, sex, and comorbidity. We estimated infection-fatality ratios (IFRs) on the basis of age-specific seroprevalence.Between May 20, 2020, and Oct 31, 2020, 13\u00b75 diagnostic tests were done per 100 inhabitants within Madurai, as compared to 7\u00b79 tests per 100 inhabitants throughout India. From a total of 440\u2009253 RT-PCR tests, 15\u2009781 (3\u00b76%) SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified, with 8720 (5\u00b74%) of 160\u2009273 being positive among individuals with symptoms, and 7061 (2\u00b75%) of 279\u2009980 being positive among individuals without symptoms, at the time of presentation. Estimated aORs for symptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed infection increased continuously by a factor of 4\u00b73 from ages 0-4 years to 80 years or older. By contrast, risk of asymptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed infection did not differ across ages 0-44 years, and thereafter increased by a factor of 1\u00b76 between ages 45-49 years and 80 years or older. Seroprevalence was 40\u00b71% (95% CI 35\u00b78-44\u00b76) at age 15 years or older by the end of the study period, indicating that RT-PCR clinical testing and surveillance testing identified only 1\u00b74% (1\u00b73-1\u00b76%) of all infections in this age group. Among RT-PCR-confirmed cases, older age, male sex, and history of cancer, diabetes, other endocrine disorders, hypertension, other chronic circulatory disorders, respiratory disorders, and chronic kidney disease were each associated with elevated risk of mortality. The CFR among RT-PCR-confirmed cases was 2\u00b74% (2\u00b72-2\u00b76); after age standardisation. At age 15 years or older, the IFR based on reported deaths was 0\u00b7043% (0\u00b7039-0\u00b7049), with reported deaths being only 11\u00b70% (8\u00b72-14\u00b75) of the expected count.For the Hindi translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.SARS-CoV-2 has spread substantially within India over multiple waves of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

In the United States, people of color are known to hold proportionately more high-contact jobs and are thus more at risk of virus infection. At the same time, these ethnic groups are on average younger than the rest of the population. This gives rise to interesting disease dynamics and non-trivial trade-offs that should be taken into consideration when developing prioritization strategies for future mass vaccine roll-outs. Here, we study the spread of COVID-19 through the US population, stratified by age, ethnicity, and occupation, using a detailed, previously-developed compartmental disease model. Based on historic data from the US mass COVID-19 vaccine roll-out that began in December 2020, we show, (i) how ethnic homophily affects the choice of optimal vaccine allocation strategy, (ii) that, notwithstanding potential ethical concerns, differentiating by ethnicity in these strategies can improve outcomes (e.g., fewer deaths), and (iii) that the most likely social context in the United States is very different from the standard assumptions made by models which do not account for ethnicity and this difference affects which allocation strategy is optimal.

Our results suggest that the efficacy of the vaccine would be increased (optimized) if, rather than being matched to the circulating strain, it is antigenically slightly further from pre-existing immunity compared with the circulating strain. The models also suggest two regimes in which LAIV that is matched to circulating strains may be protective: in children before they have built immunity to circulating strains, and in response to novel strains (such as antigenic shifts) which are at substantial antigenic distance from previously circulating strains. We provide an explanation for the variation in vaccine effectiveness between studies and countries of vaccine effectiveness observed during the 2014-15 influenza season.We use mathematical models to explore how the efficacy of LAIV is affected by the degree of mismatch with the currently circulating influenza strain and interference with pre-existing immunity. The models incorporate three key antigenic distances: the distances between the vaccine strain, pre-existing immunity, and the challenge strain.The effectiveness of the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) can vary widely, ranging from 0 - 50%. The reasons for these discrepancies remain largely unclear.LAIV is offered to children across the world, however, its effectiveness significantly varies between studies. Here, we propose a mechanistic explanation to understand these differences. We further propose a way to select the LAIV strain that would have a higher chance of being protective.","journal":"Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America","reference":"Matrajt L, Halloran ME, Antia R.

While influenza vaccines are the single most effective intervention to reduce influenza morbidity and mortality, there is considerable debate surrounding the merits and consequences of repeated seasonal vaccination. Here, we describe a two-season influenza epidemic contact network model and use it to demonstrate that increasing the level of continuity in vaccination across seasons reduces the burden on public health. We show that revaccination reduces the influenza attack rate not only because it reduces the overall number of susceptible individuals, but also because it better protects highly connected individuals, who would otherwise make a disproportionately large contribution to influenza transmission. We also demonstrate that our results hold on an empirical contact network, in the presence of assortativity in vaccination status, and are robust for a range of vaccine coverage and efficacy levels. Our work contributes a population-level perspective to debates about the merits of repeated influenza vaccination and advocates for public health policy to incorporate individual vaccine histories.

The model is calibrated based on internationally reported cases, and shows that at the start of the travel ban from Wuhan on 23 January 2020, most Chinese cities had already received many infected travelers. The travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in Mainland China, but has a more marked effect at the international scale, where case importations were reduced by nearly 80% until mid February.

However, when modelling infectious disease dynamics, data on human mobility at an appropriate temporal or spatial resolution are not always available, leading to the common use of model-derived mobility proxies. In this study we reviewed the different data sources and mobility models that have been used to characterise human movement in Africa. We then conducted a simulation study to better understand the implications of using human mobility proxies when predicting the spatial spread and dynamics of infectious diseases. We found major gaps in the availability of empirical measures of human mobility in Africa, leading to mobility proxies being used in place of data. Empirical data on subnational mobility were only available for 17\/54 countries, and in most instances, these data characterised long-term movement patterns, which were unsuitable for modelling the spread of pathogens with short generation times (time between infection of a case and their infector). Results from our simulation study demonstrated that using mobility proxies can have a substantial impact on the predicted epidemic dynamics, with complex and non-intuitive biases. In particular, the predicted times and order of epidemic invasion, and the time of epidemic peak in different locations can be underestimated or overestimated, depending on the types of proxies used and the country of interest. Our work underscores the need for regularly updated empirical measures of population movement within and between countries to aid the prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks. At the same time, there is a need to establish an evidence base to help understand which types of mobility data are most appropriate for describing the spread of emerging infectious diseases in different settings.","journal":"Epidemics","reference":"Wardle J, Bhatia S, Kraemer MUG, Nouvellet P, Cori A.

The Dominican Republic recently experienced its two largest outbreaks to date with 16,836 reported cases in 2015 and 20,123 reported cases in 2019. With continued increases in dengue transmission, developing tools to better prepare healthcare systems and mosquito control agencies is of critical importance. Before such tools can be developed, however, we must first better understand potential drivers of dengue transmission. To that end, we focus in this paper on determining relationships between climate variables and dengue transmission with an emphasis on eight provinces and the capital city of the Dominican Republic in the period 2015-2019. We present summary statistics for dengue cases, temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity in this period, and we conduct an analysis of correlated lags between climate variables and dengue cases as well as correlated lags among dengue cases in each of the nine locations. We find that the southwestern province of Barahona had the largest dengue incidence in both 2015 and 2019. Among all climate variables considered, lags between relative humidity variables and dengue cases were the most frequently correlated. We found that most locations had significant correlations with cases in other locations at lags of zero weeks.

The sections from primary tumors were stained with H&E, then digitized and analyzed by the pipeline. In the first step, a classifier trained manually by pathologists was applied to digital slides to annotate the areas of stroma, normal\/benign ducts, cancer ducts, dense lymphocyte region, and blood vessels. In the second step, a recurrence risk classifier was trained on eight select architectural and spatial organization tissue features from the annotated areas to predict recurrence risk.The recurrence classifier significantly predicted the 10-year recurrence risk in the training [hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u200911.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.3-25.3, accuracy (Acc)\u2009=\u20090.87, sensitivity (Sn)\u2009=\u20090.71, and specificity (Sp)\u2009=\u20090.91] and independent validation [HR\u2009=\u20096.39 (95% CI 3.0-13.8), p\u2009<\u20090.0001;Acc\u2009=\u20090.85, Sn\u2009=\u20090.5, Sp\u2009=\u20090.91] cohorts.

Furthermore, it significantly identified patients that might benefit from additional therapy (validation cohort p\u2009=\u20090.0006).Our machine learning-based model fills an unmet clinical need for accurately predicting the recurrence risk for lumpectomy-treated DCIS patients.Breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) represent approximately 20% of screen-detected breast cancers. The overall risk for DCIS patients treated with breast-conserving surgery stems almost exclusively from local recurrence. Although a mastectomy or adjuvant radiation can reduce recurrence risk, there are significant concerns regarding patient over-\/under-treatment. Current clinicopathological markers are insufficient to accurately assess the recurrence risk. To address this issue, we developed a novel machine learning (ML) pipeline to predict risk of ipsilateral recurrence using digitized whole slide images (WSI) and clinicopathologic long-term outcome data from a retrospectively collected cohort of DCIS patients (n\u2009=\u2009344) treated with lumpectomy at Nottingham University Hospital, UK.","journal":"Breast cancer research : BCR","reference":"Klimov S, Miligy IM, Gertych A, Jiang Y, Toss MS, Rida P, Ellis IO, Green A, Krishnamurti U, Rakha EA, Aneja R.

However, analogous to mathematical models for epidemics, the growth rate can be defined as a function of mechanistic traits: the basic reproduction number (the average number of cells each infected cell infects) and the mean generation time (the average length of a replication cycle). Fitting a model to previously published and newly generated data from experiments in human lung cells, we compared estimates of growth rate, reproduction number and generation time for six influenza A strains. Of four strains in previously published data, A\/Canada\/RV733\/2003 (seasonal H1N1) had the lowest basic reproduction number, followed by A\/Mexico\/INDRE4487\/2009 (pandemic H1N1), then A\/Indonesia\/05\/2005 (spill-over H5N1) and A\/Anhui\/1\/2013 (spill-over H7N9). This ordering of strains was preserved for both generation time and growth rate, suggesting a positive biological correlation between these quantities which have not been previously observed. We further investigated these potential correlations using data from reassortant viruses with different internal proteins (from A\/England\/195\/2009 (pandemic H1N1) and A\/Turkey\/05\/2005 (H5N1)), and the same surface proteins (from A\/Puerto Rico\/8\/34 (lab-adapted H1N1)). Similar correlations between traits were observed for these viruses, confirming our initial findings and suggesting that these patterns were related to the degree of human adaptation of internal genes. Also, the model predicted that strains with a smaller basic reproduction number, shorter generation time and slower growth rate underwent more replication cycles by the time of peak viral load, potentially accumulating mutations more quickly. These results illustrate the utility of mathematical models in inferring traits driving observed differences in in vitro growth of influenza strains.","journal":"Epidemics","reference":"Yan AWC, Zhou J, Beauchemin CAA, Russell CA, Barclay WS, Riley S.

These 23 jurisdictions covered 42.5% of the US population (approximately 140 million persons), spanned all 4 US Census regions, and reported data that reflected all 59 federally funded CICT programs. This study estimated that 1.11 million cases and 27\u202f231 hospitalizations were averted by CICT programs under a scenario where 80% of interviewed cases and monitored contacts and 30% of notified contacts fully complied with isolation and quarantine guidance, eliminating their contributions to future transmission. As many as 1.36 million cases and 33\u202f527 hospitalizations could have been prevented if all interviewed cases and monitored contacts had entered into and fully complied with isolation and quarantine guidelines upon being interviewed or notified. Across both scenarios and all jurisdictions, CICT averted an estimated median of 21.2% (range, 1.3%-65.8%) of the cases not prevented by vaccination and other nonpharmaceutical interventions.The primary outcomes were numbers of cases and hospitalizations averted and the percentage of cases averted among cases not prevented by vaccination and other nonpharmaceutical interventions.These findings suggest that CICT programs likely had a substantial role in curtailing the pandemic in most jurisdictions during the 2020 to 2021 winter peak. Differences in outcomes across jurisdictions indicate an opportunity to further improve CICT effectiveness.

We conducted a repeated cross-sectional study to measure contact patterns weekly from March 2020 to March 2021 to estimate the impact of these policies, covering 3 national lockdowns interspersed by periods of less restrictive policies.The repeated cross-sectional survey data were collected using online surveys of representative samples of the UK population by age and gender. Survey participants were recruited by the online market research company Ipsos MORI through internet-based banner and social media ads and email campaigns. The participant data used for this analysis are restricted to those who reported living in England. We calculated the mean daily contacts reported using a (clustered) bootstrap and fitted a censored negative binomial model to estimate age-stratified contact matrices and estimate proportional changes to the basic reproduction number under controlled conditions using the change in contacts as a scaling factor. To put the findings in perspective, we discuss contact rates recorded throughout the year in terms of previously recorded rates from the POLYMOD study social contact study. The survey recorded 101,350 observations from 19,914 participants who reported 466,710 contacts over 53 weeks. We observed changes in social contact patterns in England over time and by participants' age, personal risk factors, and perception of risk. The mean reported contacts for adults 18 to 59 years old ranged between 2.39 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.20 to 2.60) contacts and 4.93 (95% CI 4.65 to 5.19) contacts during the study period. The mean contacts for school-age children (5 to 17 years old) ranged from 3.07 (95% CI 2.89 to 3.27) to 15.11 (95% CI 13.87 to 16.41). This demonstrates a sustained decrease in social contacts compared to a mean of 11.08 (95% CI 10.54 to 11.57) contacts per participant in all age groups combined as measured by the POLYMOD social contact study in 2005 to 2006. Contacts measured during periods of lockdowns were lower than in periods of eased social restrictions. The use of face coverings outside the home has remained high since the government mandated use in some settings in July 2020. The main limitations of this analysis are the potential for selection bias, as participants are recruited through internet-based campaigns, and recall bias, in which participants may under- or overreport the number of contacts they have made.In this study, we observed that recorded contacts reduced dramatically compared to prepandemic levels (as measured in the POLYMOD study), with changes in reported contacts correlated with government interventions throughout the pandemic. Despite easing of restrictions in the summer of 2020, the mean number of reported contacts only returned to about half of that observed prepandemic at its highest recorded level. The CoMix survey provides a unique repeated cross-sectional data set for a full year in England, from the first day of the first lockdown, for use in statistical analyses and mathematical modelling of COVID-19 and other diseases.","journal":"PLoS medicine","reference":"Gimma A, Munday JD, Wong KLM, Coletti P, Van Zandvoort K, Prem K, , Klepac P, Rubin GJ, Funk S, Edmunds WJ, Jarvis CI.

Therefore, given the ongoing threat posed by COVID-19, vaccines remain a critical line of defense for protecting the public and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.Our study revealed a strong and statistically significant negative association between vaccine uptake and COVID-19 CHR across each variant wave, with boosters providing additional protection during the Omicron wave. Higher underlying population immunity is shown to be associated with reduced COVID-19 CHR. Additionally, more stringent government policies are generally associated with decreased CHR. However, the impact of activity-related engagement levels on COVID-19 health outcomes varied across different waves. Regarding static variables, the social vulnerability index consistently exhibits positive associations with CHR, while Medicaid spending per person consistently shows a negative association. However, the impacts of other static factors vary in magnitude and significance across different waves.In this study, we analyze the association between time-dependent vaccination rates and COVID-19 health outcomes for 48 U.S. states. We primarily focus on case-hospitalization risk (CHR) as the outcome of interest, using it as a population-level proxy for disease burden on healthcare systems. Performing the analysis using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) allowed us to incorporate real-world nonlinearities and control for critical dynamic (time-changing) and static (temporally constant) factors. Dynamic factors include testing rates, activity-related engagement levels in the population, underlying population immunity, and policy. Static factors incorporate comorbidities, social vulnerability, race, and state healthcare expenditures. We used SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance data to model the different COVID-19 variant-driven waves separately, and evaluate if there is a changing role of the potential drivers of health outcomes across waves.Population-level vaccine efficacy is a critical component of understanding COVID-19 risk, informing public health policy, and mitigating disease impacts. Unlike individual-level clinical trials, population-level analysis characterizes how well vaccines worked in the face of real-world challenges like emerging variants, differing mobility patterns, and policy changes.","journal":"BMC public health","reference":"Du H, Saiyed S, Gardner LM.

We assumed that testing was a function of access to healthcare facilities and availability of Ag-RDTs. We explicitly modelled symptomatic testing demand from non-SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and measured impact based on the number of infections averted due to test-and-isolate.Testing symptomatic individuals yields greater benefits than any asymptomatic community testing strategy until most symptomatic individuals who sought testing have been tested. Meeting symptomatic testing demand likely requires at least 200-400 tests\/100,000 people\/day on average as symptomatic testing demand is highly influenced by non-SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. After symptomatic testing demand is satisfied, excess tests to proactively screen for asymptomatic infections among household members yields the largest additional infections averted.","journal":"Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America","reference":"Han AX, Girdwood S, Khan S, Sacks JA, Toporowski A, Huq N, Hannay E, Russell CA, Nichols BE.

Using a simple meta-population model, we demonstrate that, if sub-populations either differ in characteristics affecting their basic reproduction numbers or if their members mix preferentially, weighted average sub-population immunities cannot be compared with the proportionally-mixing homogeneous population-immunity threshold, as public health practitioners are wont to do. Then we review the effect of heterogeneity in average per capita contact rates on the basic meta-population reproduction number. To the extent that population density affects contacts, for example, rates might differ in urban and rural sub-populations. Other differences among sub-populations in characteristics affecting their basic reproduction numbers would contribute similarly. In agreement with more recent results, we show that heterogeneous preferential mixing among sub-populations increases the basic meta-population reproduction number more than homogeneous preferential mixing does. Next we refine earlier results on the effects of heterogeneity in sub-population immunities and preferential mixing on the effective meta-population reproduction number. Finally, we propose the vector of partial derivatives of this reproduction number with respect to the sub-population immunities as a fundamentally new tool for targeting vaccination efforts.

Reconstructing the history of bluetongue in French cattle under control strategies such as vaccination has been hampered by the high level of sub-clinical infection, incomplete case data and poor understanding of vaccine uptake over time and space. To tackle these challenges, we used three age-structured serological surveys carried out in cattle (N\u202f=\u202f22,342) from ten administrative subdivisions called departments. We fitted catalytic models within a Bayesian MCMC framework to reconstruct the force of seroconversion from infection or vaccination, and the population-level susceptibility per semester between 2007 and 2016. In the departments of the study area, we estimated that 36% of cattle had been infected prior to vaccine rollout that became compulsory from July 2008. The last outbreak case was notified in December 2009, at which time 83% of the animals were seropositive, under the cumulative effect of vaccination and infection. The probability of seroconversion per semester dropped below 10% after 2010 when vaccination became optional. Vaccine uptake was smaller during the 2012 campaign than during the one in 2011, with strong regional contrasts. Eighty four percent of cattle were susceptible when bluetongue re-emerged in 2015. Thus, serological surveys can be used to estimate vaccine uptake and the magnitude of infection, the relative effect of which can sometimes be inferred using prior knowledge on reported incidence and vaccination dates.","journal":"Epidemics","reference":"Courtejoie N, Salje H, Durand B, Zanella G, Cauchemez S.

We studied the effects of population mobility on the transmission of 17 endemic viruses and SARS-CoV-2 in Seattle over a 4-year period, 2018-2022. Before 2020, visits to schools and daycares, within-city mixing, and visitor inflow preceded or coincided with seasonal outbreaks of endemic viruses. Pathogen circulation dropped substantially after the initiation of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders in March 2020. During this period, mobility was a positive, leading indicator of transmission of all endemic viruses and lagging and negatively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 activity. Mobility was briefly predictive of SARS-CoV-2 transmission when restrictions relaxed but associations weakened in subsequent waves. The rebound of endemic viruses was heterogeneously timed but exhibited stronger, longer-lasting relationships with mobility than SARS-CoV-2. Overall, mobility is most predictive of respiratory virus transmission during periods of dramatic behavioral change and at the beginning of epidemic waves.","journal":"Nature communications","reference":"Perofsky AC, Hansen CL, Burstein R, Boyle S, Prentice R, Marshall C, Reinhart D, Capodanno B, Truong M, Schwabe-Fry K, Kuchta K, Pfau B, Acker Z, Lee J, Sibley TR, McDermot E, Rodriguez-Salas L, Stone J, Gamboa L, Han PD, Adler A, Waghmare A, Jackson ML, Famulare M, Shendure J, Bedford T, Chu HY, Englund JA, Starita LM, Viboud C.

During peak periods with suitable weather conditions, vector control activities and raising public health awareness on the proper usage of intervention measures, such as indoor residual spraying and personal protection, should be prioritized.Malaria incidence decreased from 2010 to 2022 and was concentrated in the southern regions for both P. falciparum and P. vivax. Rainfall and maximum humidity were identified as most strongly associated with malaria during the study period. Rainfall was associated with P. falciparum incidence in the north and central regions during 2010-2011, and with P. vivax incidence in the north and central regions during 2012-2015. Maximum humidity was persistently associated with P. falciparum and P. vivax incidence in the south.The government of Lao PDR has increased efforts to control malaria transmission in order to reach its national elimination goal by 2030. Weather can influence malaria transmission dynamics and should be considered when assessing the impact of elimination interventions but this relationship has not been well characterized in Lao PDR.

Relaxed intervention measures and summer travel have been implicated as drivers of the second wave. Here, we build a phylogeographic model to evaluate how newly introduced lineages, as opposed to the rekindling of persistent lineages, contributed to the COVID-19 resurgence in Europe. We inform this model using genomic, mobility and epidemiological data from 10 West European countries and estimate that in many countries more than 50% of the lineages circulating in late summer resulted from new introductions since June 15th. The success in onwards transmission of these lineages is predicted by SARS-CoV-2 incidence during this period. Relatively early introductions from Spain into the United Kingdom contributed to the successful spread of the 20A.EU1\/B.1.177 variant. The pervasive spread of variants that have not been associated with an advantage in transmissibility highlights the threat of novel variants of concern that emerged more recently and have been disseminated by holiday travel.

Insufficient vaccination coverage left susceptible pockets among adults in Japan, and the outbreak of rubella from 2012 to 2013 resulted in 45 observed CRS cases. Given a limited stock of rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) available, the Japanese government recommended healthcare providers to prioritize vaccination to those confirmed with low level of immunity, or to those likely to transmit to pregnant women. Although a test-and-vaccinate policy could potentially help reduce the use of the limited stockpile of vaccines, by selectively elevating herd immunity, the cost of serological testing is generally high and comparable to the vaccine itself. Here, we aimed to examine whether random vaccination would be more cost-beneficial than the test-and-vaccinate strategy. A mathematical model was employed to evaluate the vaccination policy implemented in 2012-2013, quantifying the benefit-to-cost ratio to achieve herd immunity. The modelling exercise demonstrated that, while the test-and-vaccinate strategy can efficiently achieve herd immunity when stockpiles of RCV are limited, random vaccination would be a more cost-beneficial strategy. As long as the herd immunity acts as the goal of vaccination, our findings apply to future supplementary immunization strategy.","journal":"International journal of environmental research and public health","reference":"Saito MM, Ejima K, Kinoshita R, Nishiura H.

For the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015), we estimated the incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for diseases and injuries at the global, regional, and national scale over the period of 1990 to 2015. Methods: We estimated incidence and prevalence by age, sex, cause, year, and geography with a wide range of updated and standardised analytical procedures. Improvements from GBD 2013 included the addition of new data sources, updates to literature reviews for 85 causes, and the identification and inclusion of additional studies published up to November, 2015, to expand the database used for estimation of non-fatal outcomes to 60 900 unique data sources. Prevalence and incidence by cause and sequelae were determined with DisMod-MR 2.1, an improved version of the DisMod-MR Bayesian meta-regression tool first developed for GBD 2010 and GBD 2013. For some causes, we used alternative modelling strategies where the complexity of the disease was not suited to DisMod-MR 2.1 or where incidence and prevalence needed to be determined from other data. For GBD 2015 we created a summary indicator that combines measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility (the Socio-demographic Index [SDI]) and used it to compare observed patterns of health loss to the expected pattern for countries or locations with similar SDI scores. Findings: We generated 9\u00b73 billion estimates from the various combinations of prevalence, incidence, and YLDs for causes, sequelae, and impairments by age, sex, geography, and year. In 2015, two causes had acute incidences in excess of 1 billion: upper respiratory infections (17\u00b72 billion, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 15\u00b74\u009619\u00b72 billion) and diarrhoeal diseases (2\u00b739 billion, 2\u00b730\u00962\u00b750 billion). Eight causes of chronic disease and injury each affected more than 10% of the world's population in 2015: permanent caries, tension-type headache, iron-deficiency anaemia, age-related and other hearing loss, migraine, genital herpes, refraction and accommodation disorders, and ascariasis. The impairment that affected the greatest number of people in 2015 was anaemia, with 2\u00b736 billion (2\u00b735\u00962\u00b737 billion) individuals affected. The second and third leading impairments by number of individuals affected were hearing loss and vision loss, respectively. Between 2005 and 2015, there was little change in the leading causes of years lived with disability (YLDs) on a global basis. NCDs accounted for 18 of the leading 20 causes of age-standardised YLDs on a global scale. Where rates were decreasing, the rate of decrease for YLDs was slower than that of years of life lost (YLLs) for nearly every cause included in our analysis. For low SDI geographies, Group 1 causes typically accounted for 20\u009630% of total disability, largely attributable to nutritional deficiencies, malaria, neglected tropical diseases, HIV\/AIDS, and tuberculosis. Lower back and neck pain was the leading global cause of disability in 2015 in most countries. The leading cause was sense organ disorders in 22 countries in Asia and Africa and one in central Latin America; diabetes in four countries in Oceania; HIV\/AIDS in three southern sub-Saharan African countries; collective violence and legal intervention in two north African and Middle Eastern countries; iron-deficiency anaemia in Somalia and Venezuela; depression in Uganda; onchoceriasis in Liberia; and other neglected tropical diseases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Interpretation: Ageing of the world's population is increasing the number of people living with sequelae of diseases and injuries. Shifts in the epidemiological profile driven by socioeconomic change also contribute to the continued increase in years lived with disability (YLDs) as well as the rate of increase in YLDs. Despite limitations imposed by gaps in data availability and the variable quality of the data available, the standardised and comprehensive approach of the GBD study provides opportunities to examine broad trends, compare those trends between countries or subnational geographies, benchmark against locations at similar stages of development, and gauge the strength or weakness of the estimates available.","journal":"The Lancet","reference":"GBD 2015 Maternal Mortality Collaborators*.

We first used elastic net regression to identify potential virus interactions and further examined the robustness of the found interactions by comparing the performance of Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models with and without the interactions. We then used the models to compute counterfactual estimates of cumulative incidence and estimate the reduction during the COVID-19 pandemic period from March 2020 to May 2021, for each virus.Circulation of several respiratory viruses has been low during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may lead to increased population susceptibility. It is thus important to enhance monitoring of these viruses and promptly enact measures to mitigate their health impacts (e.g., influenza vaccination campaign and hospital infection prevention) as societies resume normal activities.We identified potential interactions for three endemic human coronaviruses (CoV-NL63, CoV-HKU, and CoV-OC43), parainfluenza (PIV)-1, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). We found significant reductions (by ~70-90%) in cumulative incidence of CoV-OC43, CoV-229E, human metapneumovirus, PIV-2, PIV-4, RSV, and influenza virus during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this paper we extend a previously published model for estimating the selection strength for new SARS-CoV-2 variants to a hierarchical, mixed-effects, renewal equation model. This formulation allows us to globally estimate selection effects at different spatial levels while controlling for complex patterns of transmission and jointly inferring the effects of unit-level covariates in the spatial heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 selection effects. Applying this model to the spread of Omicron in 40 counties finding evidence for very strong (64%) but very heterogeneous selection effects at the country level. We further considered different measures of vaccination levels and measures of recent population-level infection as possible explanations. However, none of those variables were found to explain a significant proportion of the heterogeneity in country-level selection effects. We did find a significant positive correlation between the selection advantage of Delta and Omicron at the country level, suggesting that region-specific explanatory variables of fitness differences do exist.

Different drug categories and factors such as age, gender, and ethnicity are associated with different overdose mortality characteristics that may also change in time. For example, the average age at death from a drug overdose has decreased from 1940 to 1990 while the overall mortality rate has steadily increased. To provide insight into the population-level dynamics of drug overdose mortality, we develop an age-structured model for drug addiction. Using an augmented ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), we show through a simple example how our model can be combined with synthetic observation data to estimate mortality rate and an age-distribution parameter.

We quantify the health impact of these programmes by estimating the deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted by vaccination against ten pathogens in 98 LMICs between 2000 and 2030.16 independent research groups provided model-based disease burden estimates under a range of vaccination coverage scenarios for ten pathogens: hepatitis B virus, Haemophilus influenzae type B, human papillomavirus, Japanese encephalitis, measles, Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A, Streptococcus pneumoniae, rotavirus, rubella, and yellow fever. Using standardised demographic data and vaccine coverage, the impact of vaccination programmes was determined by comparing model estimates from a no-vaccination counterfactual scenario with those from a reported and projected vaccination scenario. We present deaths and DALYs averted between 2000 and 2030 by calendar year and by annual birth cohort.We estimate that vaccination of the ten selected pathogens will have averted 69 million (95% credible interval 52-88) deaths between 2000 and 2030, of which 37 million (30-48) were averted between 2000 and 2019. From 2000 to 2019, this represents a 45% (36-58) reduction in deaths compared with the counterfactual scenario of no vaccination. Most of this impact is concentrated in a reduction in mortality among children younger than 5 years (57% reduction [52-66]), most notably from measles. Over the lifetime of birth cohorts born between 2000 and 2030, we predict that 120 million (93-150) deaths will be averted by vaccination, of which 58 million (39-76) are due to measles vaccination and 38 million (25-52) are due to hepatitis B vaccination. We estimate that increases in vaccine coverage and introductions of additional vaccines will result in a 72% (59-81) reduction in lifetime mortality in the 2019 birth cohort.Increases in vaccine coverage and the introduction of new vaccines into LMICs have had a major impact in reducing mortality.

Surveillance is recognised as a cornerstone of elimination programmes, allowing early identification of outbreaks, thus enabling control and preventing re-emergence. Fever-rash surveillance is increasingly available across WHO regions, and this symptom-based reporting is broadly used for measles surveillance. However, as measles control increases, symptom-based cases are increasingly likely to reflect infection with other diseases with similar symptoms such as rubella, which affects the same populations, and can have a similar seasonality. The WHO recommends that cases from suspected measles outbreaks be laboratory-confirmed, to identify 'true' cases, corresponding to measles IgM titres exceeding a threshold indicative of infection. Although serological testing for IgM has been integrated into the fever-rash surveillance systems in many countries, the logistics of sending in every suspected case are often beyond the health system's capacity. We show how age data from serologically confirmed cases can be leveraged to infer the status of non-tested samples, thus strengthening the information we can extract from symptom-based surveillance. Applying an age-specific confirmation model to data from three countries with divergent epidemiology across Africa, we identify the proportion of cases that need to be serologically tested to achieve target levels of accuracy in estimated infected numbers and discuss how this varies depending on the epidemiological context. Our analysis provides an approach to refining estimates of incidence leveraging all available data, which has the potential to improve allocation of resources, and thus contribute to rapid and efficient control of outbreaks.","journal":"Epidemiology and infection","reference":"Prada JM, Metcalf CJE, Ferrari MJ.

Recently, evidence from systematic reviews and database analyses have improved our understanding of key determinants of MCV impact. We explore how representations of these determinants affect model-based estimation of vaccination impact in ten countries with the highest measles burden.Using Dynamic Measles Immunisation Calculation Engine (DynaMICE), we modelled the effect of evidence updates for five determinants of MCV impact: case-fatality risk, contact patterns, age-dependent vaccine efficacy, the delivery of supplementary immunisation activities (SIAs) to zero-dose children, and the basic reproduction number. We assessed the incremental vaccination impact of the first (MCV1) and second (MCV2) doses of routine immunisation and SIAs, using metrics of total vaccine-averted cases, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) over 2000-2050. We also conducted a scenario capturing the effect of COVID-19 related disruptions on measles burden and vaccination impact.Incorporating updated evidence particularly on vaccine efficacy and case-fatality risk reduces estimates of vaccination impact moderately, but its overall impact remains considerable. High MCV coverage through both routine immunisation and SIAs remains essential for achieving and maintaining low incidence in high measles burden settings.Incorporated with the updated data sources, DynaMICE projected 253 million measles cases, 3.8 million deaths and 233 million DALYs incurred over 2000-2050 in the ten high-burden countries when MCV1, MCV2, and SIA doses were implemented. Compared to no vaccination, MCV1 contributed to 66% reduction in cumulative measles cases, while MCV2 and SIAs reduced this further to 90%. Among the updated determinants, shifting from fixed to linearly-varying vaccine efficacy by age and from static to time-varying case-fatality risks had the biggest effect on MCV impact. While varying the basic reproduction number showed a limited effect, updates on the other four determinants together resulted in an overall reduction of vaccination impact by 0.58%, 26.2%, and 26.7% for cases, deaths, and DALYs averted, respectively. COVID-19 related disruptions to measles vaccination are not likely to change the influence of these determinants on MCV impact, but may lead to a 3% increase in cases over 2000-2050.","journal":"BMC medicine","reference":"Fu H, Abbas K, Klepac P, van Zandvoort K, Tanvir H, Portnoy A, Jit M.

Thus, the development of strategies to optimize disease management is a major challenge. We propose a framework that can be used to estimate total snakebite incidence at a fine political scale.First, we generated fine-scale snakebite risk maps based on the distribution of venomous snakes in Colombia. We then used a generalized mixed-effect model that estimates total snakebite incidence based on risk maps, poverty, and travel time to the nearest medical center. Finally, we calibrated our model with snakebite data in Colombia from 2010 to 2019 using the Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo algorithm. Our results suggest that 10.19% of total snakebite cases (532.26 yearly envenomings) are not reported and these snakebite victims do not seek medical attention, and that populations in the Orinoco and Amazonian regions are the most at-risk and show the highest percentage of underreporting. We also found that variables such as precipitation of the driest month and mean temperature of the warmest quarter influences the suitability of environments for venomous snakes rather than absolute temperature or rainfall.Our framework permits snakebite underreporting to be estimated using data on snakebite incidence and surveillance, presence locations for the most medically significant venomous snake species, and openly available information on population size, poverty, climate, land cover, roads, and the locations of medical centers. Thus, our algorithm could be used in other countries to estimate total snakebite incidence and improve disease management strategies; however, this framework does not serve as a replacement for a surveillance system, which should be made a priority in countries facing similar public health challenges.","journal":"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","reference":"Bravo-Vega C, Renjifo-Iba\u00f1ez C, Santos-Vega M, Le\u00f3n Nu\u00f1ez LJ, Angarita-Sierra T, Cordovez JM.

Interpreting trends in infection requires disentangling the underlying growth rate of cases from the delay from symptom onset to presenting to healthcare. We developed a nowcasting Bayesian method which incorporates time-varying delays (EpiLine) to quantify the changes in the delay from symptom onset to healthcare presentation and the underlying mpox growth rate over the period May-August 2022 in the UK. We show that the mean delay between symptom onset and healthcare presentation for mpox in the UK decreased from 22 days in early May 2022 to 10 days by early June and 8 days in August 2022. When we account for these dynamic delays, the time-varying growth rate declined gradually and continuously in the UK during the May-August 2022 period. Not accounting for varying time delays would have incorrectly characterised the growth rate by a sharp increase followed by a rapid decline in mpox cases. Our results highlight the importance of correctly quantifying the delay between symptom onset to healthcare presentation when characterising the epidemic growth of mpox in the UK. The gradual reduction in the rate of epidemic spread, which pre-dated the vaccine roll-out, is consistent with gradual risk reduction or acquired immunity amongst the highest risk individuals.

For many methods, the genetic distance threshold used to connect sequences in the transmission network is a key parameter informing the properties of inferred networks. Using a distance threshold that is too high can result in a network with many spurious links, making it difficult to interpret. Conversely, a distance threshold that is too low can result in a network with too few links, which may not capture key insights into clusters of public health concern. Published research using the HIV-TRACE software package frequently uses the default threshold of 0.015 substitutions\/site for HIV pol gene sequences, but in many cases, investigators heuristically select other threshold parameters to better capture the underlying dynamics of the epidemic they are studying. Here, we present a general heuristic scoring approach for tuning a distance threshold adaptively, which seeks to prevent the formation of giant clusters. We prioritize the ratio of the sizes of the largest and the second largest cluster, maximizing the number of clusters present in the network. We apply our scoring heuristic to outbreaks with different characteristics, such as regional or temporal variability, and demonstrate the utility of using the scoring mechanism's suggested distance threshold to identify clusters exhibiting risk factors that would have otherwise been more difficult to identify. For example, while we found that a 0.015 substitutions\/site distance threshold is typical for US-like epidemics, recent outbreaks like the CRF07_BC subtype among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China have been found to have a lower optimal threshold of 0.005 to better capture the transition from injected drug use (IDU) to MSM as the primary risk factor. Alternatively, in communities surrounding Lake Victoria in Uganda, where there has been sustained hetero-sexual transmission for many years, we found that a larger distance threshold is necessary to capture a more risk factor-diverse population with sparse sampling over a longer period of time. Such identification may allow for more informed intervention action by respective public health officials.","journal":"bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology","reference":"Weaver S, D\u00e1vila-Conn V, Ji D, Verdonk H, \u00c1vila-R\u00edos S, Leigh Brown AJ, Wertheim JO, Kosakovsky Pond SL.

We found that while climatic variables are associated with seasonal variation in the incidence of avian influenza outbreaks in the North of the country, this is not the case in the Centre and the South.

While traditional clinical prediction models focus on individual patient-level parameters, we hypothesize that for infectious diseases, population-level data sources may improve predictive ability. To create a clinical prediction model that integrates patient-extrinsic data for identifying DENV among febrile patients presenting to a hospital in Thailand, we fit random forest classifiers combining clinical data with climate and population-level epidemiologic data. In cross-validation, compared to a parsimonious model with the top clinical predictors, a model with the addition of climate data, reconstructed susceptibility estimates, force of infection estimates, and a recent case clustering metric significantly improved model performance.","journal":"Science advances","reference":"Williams RJ, Brintz BJ, Ribeiro Dos Santos G, Huang AT, Buddhari D, Kaewhiran S, Iamsirithaworn S, Rothman AL, Thomas S, Farmer A, Fernandez S, Cummings DAT, Anderson KB, Salje H, Leung DT.

Annual influenza forecasts help policymakers implement effective countermeasures to control both seasonal and pandemic outbreaks. Existing forecasting techniques suffer from problems such as poor forecasting performance, lack of modeling flexibility, data sparsity, and\/or lack of intepretability. We propose EpiDeep, a novel deep neural network approach for epidemic forecasting which tackles all of these issues by learning meaningful representations of incidence curves in a continuous feature space and accurately predicting future incidences, peak intensity, peak time, and onset of the upcoming season. We present extensive experiments on forecasting ILI (influenza-like illnesses) in the United States, leveraging multiple metrics to quantify success. Our results demonstrate that EpiDeep is successful at learning meaningful embeddings and, more importantly, that these embeddings evolve as the season progresses.

Previous malaria models of mass-interventions have consistently oversimplified how mass interventions are implemented. We present an individual based, spatially explicit model of malaria transmission that includes all the programmatic implementation details of mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns. We uncover how the impact of MDA campaigns is determined by the interaction between implementation logistics, patterns of human mobility and how transmission risk is distributed over space. This translates into a higher likelihood of malaria elimination for areas with true prevalence under 3% with a faster implementation, in highly mobile populations. If populations are more static, deploying less interventions teams would be cost optimal and predicted to be as impactful. We conclude that mass drug interventions can be an invaluable tool towards malaria elimination in the right context, specifically when paired with effective vector control.","journal":"bioRxiv","reference":"Bo Gao, Sompob Saralamba, Yoel Lubell, Arjen M Dondorp, Lisa White, Ricardo Aguas.

Using a Rwanda-specific spatial calibration of an individual-based malaria model, we evaluate 26 strategies aimed at minimizing treatment failures and delaying the spread of R561H after 3, 5 and 10\u2009years. Lengthening ACT courses and deploying multiple first-line therapies (MFTs) reduced treatment failures after 5\u2009years when compared to the current approach of a 3-d course of artemether-lumefantrine. The best among these options (an MFT policy) resulted in median treatment failure counts that were 49% lower and a median R561H allele frequency that was 0.15 lower than under baseline. New approaches to resistance management, such as triple ACTs or sequential courses of two different ACTs, were projected to have a larger impact than longer ACT courses or MFT; these were associated with median treatment failure counts in 5\u2009years that were 81-92% lower than the current approach. A policy response to currently circulating artemisinin-resistant genotypes in Africa is urgently needed to prevent a population-wide rise in treatment failures.","journal":"Nature medicine","reference":"Zupko RJ, Nguyen TD, Ngabonziza JCS, Kabera M, Li H, Tran TN, Tran KT, Uwimana A, Boni MF.

The resulting data set is novel in capturing very detailed social contact history linked to asymptomatic disease status during a period of significant restriction on social activities. We use this data to explore 3 questions: (i) Did participation in university activities enhance infection risk? (ii) How do contact definitions rank in their ability to explain test outcome during periods of social restrictions? (iii) Do patterns in the protective behaviours help explain discrepancies between the explanatory performance of different contact measures? We classify activities into settings and use Bayesian logistic regression to model test outcome, computing posterior model probabilities to compare the performance of models adopting different contact definitions. Associations between protective behaviours, participant characteristics and setting are explored at the level of individual activities using multiple correspondence analysis (MCA). We find that participation in air travel or non-university work activities was associated with a positive asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, in contrast to participation in research and teaching settings. Intriguingly, logistic regression models with binary measures of contact in a setting performed better than more traditional contact numbers or person contact hours (PCH). The MCA indicates that patterns of protective behaviours vary between setting, in a manner which may help explain the preference for any participation as a contact measure. We conclude that linked PCR testing and social contact data can in principle be used to test the utility of contact definitions, and the investigation of contact definitions in larger linked studies is warranted to ensure contact data can capture environmental and social factors influencing transmission risk.","journal":"Epidemics","reference":"Fairbanks EL, Bolton KJ, Jia R, Figueredo GP, Knight H, Vedhara K.

Because of limited resources, certain interventions can be implemented in only some facilities; thus, decision-makers need to evaluate which interventions may be best to implement.An agent-based model of health care facilities was developed in 2016 to simulate the spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) for 10 years starting in 2010 and to simulate the use of various MDRO interventions for 3 years starting in 2017. All health care facilities (23 hospitals, 5 long-term acute care hospitals, and 74 nursing homes) serving adult inpatients in Orange County, California, were included, and 42 target facilities were identified via network analyses.Increasing contact precaution effectiveness, increasing interfacility communication about patients' MDRO status, and performing decolonization using antiseptic bathing soap and a nasal product in a specific group of target facilities.To identify a group of target facilities and assess which MDRO intervention would be best to implement in the Shared Healthcare Intervention to Eliminate Life-threatening Dissemination of MDROs in Orange County, a large regional public health collaborative in Orange County, California.The findings of this study highlight the ways in which modeling can inform design of regional interventions and suggested that decolonization would be the best strategy for the Shared Healthcare Intervention to Eliminate Life-threatening Dissemination of MDROs in Orange County.MRSA and CRE prevalence and number of new carriers (ie, transmission events).Compared with continuing infection control measures used in Orange County as of 2017, increasing contact precaution effectiveness from 40% to 64% in 42 target facilities yielded relative reductions of 0.8% (range, 0.5%-1.1%) in MRSA prevalence and 2.4% (range, 0.8%-4.6%) in CRE prevalence in health care facilities countywide after 3 years, averting 761 new MRSA transmission events (95% CI, 756-765 events) and 166 new CRE transmission events (95% CI, 158-174 events).

Enhancing global capacity to study and interpret infectious disease surveillance data, and to develop data-driven computational models to guide policy, represents one of the most cost-effective, and yet overlooked, ways to prepare for the next pandemic. Epidemiological and behavioral data from recent pandemics and historic scourges have provided rich opportunities for validation of computational models, while new sequencing technologies and the 'big data' revolution present new tools for studying the epidemiology of outbreaks in real time. For the past two decades, the Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies (DIEPS) of the NIH Fogarty International Center has spearheaded two synergistic programs to better understand and devise control strategies for global infectious disease threats. The Multinational Influenza Seasonal Mortality Study (MISMS) has strengthened global capacity to study the epidemiology and evolutionary dynamics of influenza viruses in 80 countries by organizing international research activities and training workshops. The Research and Policy in Infectious Disease Dynamics (RAPIDD) program and its precursor activities has established a network of global experts in infectious disease modeling operating at the research-policy interface, with collaborators in 78 countries. These activities have provided evidence-based recommendations for disease control, including during large-scale outbreaks of pandemic influenza, Ebola and Zika virus. Together, these programs have coordinated international collaborative networks to advance the study of emerging disease threats and the field of computational epidemic modeling. A global community of researchers and policy-makers have used the tools and trainings developed by these programs to interpret infectious disease patterns in their countries, understand modeling concepts, and inform control policies. Here we reflect on the scientific achievements and lessons learnt from these programs (h-index\u2009=\u2009106 for RAPIDD and 79 for MISMS), including the identification of outstanding researchers and fellows; funding flexibility for timely research workshops and working groups (particularly relative to more traditional investigator-based grant programs); emphasis on group activities such as large-scale modeling reviews, model comparisons, forecasting challenges and special journal issues; strong quality control with a light touch on outputs; and prominence of training, data-sharing, and joint publications.","journal":"Epidemics","reference":"Nelson MI, Lloyd-Smith JO, Simonsen L, Rambaut A, Holmes EC, Chowell G, Miller MA, Spiro DJ, Grenfell B, Viboud C.

While several studies have examined the predictive relationships of differing factors on COVID-19 deaths, few have looked at spatiotemporal variation at refined geographic scales. The objective of this analysis is to examine spatiotemporal variation of COVID-19 deaths in association with socioeconomic, health, demographic, and political factors, using regionalized multivariate regression as well as nationwide county-level geographically weighted random forest (GWRF) models. Analyses were performed on data from three sepearate timeframes: pandemic onset until May 2021, May 2021 through November 2021, and December 2021 until April 2022.Regionalized regression results across three time windows suggest that existing measures of social vulnerability for disaster preparedness (SVI) are associated with a higher degree of mortality from COVID-19. In comparison, GWRF models provide a more robust evaluation of feature importance and prediction, exposing the importance of local features, such as obesity, which is obscured by regional delineation. Overall, GWRF results indicate a more nuanced modeling strategy is useful for capturing the diverse spatial and temporal nature of the COVID-19 pandemic.","journal":"medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences","reference":"Seamon E, Johnson-Leung J, Miller CR, Ridenhour BJ.

For sophisticated models such as age-structured models that simulate biological agents, parameter estimation or fitting (callibration) that solves all cases of data points available presents a formidable challenge, as efficiency considerations need to be employed in order for the method to become practical. In the case of multiscale models of hepatitis C virus dynamics that deal with partial differential equations (PDEs), a fully numerical parameter estimation method was developed that does not require an analytical approximation of the solution to the multiscale model equations, avoiding the necessity to derive the long-term approximation for each model. However, the method is considerably slow because of precision problems in estimating derivatives with respect to the parameters near their boundary values, making it almost impractical for general use. In order to overcome this limitation, two steps have been taken that significantly reduce the running time by orders of magnitude and thereby lead to a practical method. First, constrained optimization is used, letting the user add constraints relating to the boundary values of each parameter before the method is executed. Second, optimization is performed by derivative-free methods, eliminating the need to evaluate expensive numerical derviative approximations. These steps that were successful in significantly speeding up a highly non-efficient approach, rendering it practical, can also be adapted to multiscale models of other viruses and other sophisticated differential equation models. The newly efficient methods that were developed as a result of the above approach are described. Illustrations are provided using a user-friendly simulator that incorporates the efficient methods for multiscale models. We provide a simulator called HCVMultiscaleFit with a Graphical User Interface that applies these methods and is useful to perform parameter estimation for simulating viral dynamics during antiviral treatment.","journal":"AIP conference proceedings","reference":"Churkin A, Reinharz V, Lewkiewicz S, Dahari H, Barash D.

Vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates from TND studies are usually interpreted as vaccine effectiveness against medically-attended influenza (MAI). However, it is also important to estimate VE against any influenza illness (symptomatic influenza (SI)) as individuals with SI are still a public health burden even if they do not seek medical care. We present a numerical method to evaluate the bias of TND-based estimates of influenza VE with respect to MAI and SI. We consider two sources of bias: (a) confounding bias due to a (possibly unobserved) covariate that is associated with both vaccination and the probability of the outcome of interest and (b) bias resulting from the effect of vaccination on the probability of seeking care. Our results indicate that (a) VE estimates may suffer from substantial confounding bias when a confounder has a different effect on the probabilities of influenza and non-influenza ARI, and (b) when vaccination reduces the probability of seeking care against influenza ARI, then estimates of VE against MAI may be unbiased while estimates of VE against SI may be have a substantial positive bias.","journal":"Vaccine","reference":"Ainslie KEC, Shi M, Haber M, Orenstein WA.

A sensitivity analysis is performed to determine model parameters that most affect disease transmission. The model is parameterized using data from Guinea, one of the three Ebola-stricken countries. Numerical simulations are performed and the parameters that drive disease transmission, with or without basic public health control measures, determined. Three effectiveness levels of such basic measures are considered.The distribution of the basic reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) for Guinea (in the absence of basic control measures) is such that [Formula: see text], for the case when the belief systems do not result in more unreported Ebola cases.

Early models predicted a thermal malaria transmission optimum of 31\u00a0\u00b0C, later revised to 25\u00a0\u00b0C using experimental data from mosquito and parasite biology. However, the link between ambient temperature and human malaria incidence remains poorly resolved.Malaria smear positivity varied between 42-83% across four clinic sites in western and coastal Kenya, with highest smear positivity in the rural, western site. The temperature ranges were cooler in the western sites and warmer in the coastal sites. In multivariate analysis controlling for socioeconomic status, age, sex, rainfall and bednet use, malaria smear positivity peaked near 25\u00a0\u00b0C at all four sites, as predicted a priori from an ecological model.To evaluate the relationship between ambient temperature and malaria risk, 5833 febrile children (<18\u00a0years-old) with an acute, non-localizing febrile illness were enrolled from four heterogenous outpatient clinic sites in Kenya (Chulaimbo, Kisumu, Msambweni and Ukunda). Thick and thin blood smears were evaluated for the presence of malaria parasites. Daily temperature estimates were obtained from land logger data, and rainfall from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Africa Rainfall Climatology (ARC) data. Thirty-day mean temperature and 30-day cumulative rainfall were estimated and each lagged by 30\u00a0days, relative to the febrile visit. A generalized linear mixed model was used to assess relationships between malaria smear positivity and predictors including temperature, rainfall, age, sex, mosquito exposure and socioeconomic status.This study provides direct field evidence of a unimodal relationship between ambient temperature and human malaria incidence with a peak in malaria transmission occurring at lower temperatures than previously recognized clinically. This nonlinear relationship with an intermediate optimal temperature implies that future climate warming could expand malaria incidence in cooler, highland regions while decreasing incidence in already warm regions with average temperatures above 25\u00a0\u00b0C. These findings support efforts to further understand the nonlinear association between ambient temperature and vector-borne diseases to better allocate resources and respond to disease threats in a future, warmer world.","journal":"Parasites & vectors","reference":"Shah MM, Krystosik AR, Ndenga BA, Mutuku FM, Caldwell JM, Otuka V, Chebii PK, Maina PW, Jembe Z, Ronga C, Bisanzio D, Anyamba A, Damoah R, Ripp K, Jagannathan P, Mordecai EA, LaBeaud AD.

The evolution of immune defense is determined by a complex interplay of costs and benefits of parasite infection and immune response, all of which may differ for male and female hosts in sexual lineages. Here, we examine fitness costs associated with an inducible immune defense in a fish-cestode host-parasite system. Cestode infection induces peritoneal fibrosis in threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), constraining cestode growth and sometimes encasing and killing the parasite. Surveying two wild populations of stickleback, we confirm that the presence of fibrosis scar tissue is associated with reduced parasite burden in both male and female fish. However, fibrotic fish had lower foraging success and reproductive fitness (reduced female egg production and male nesting success), indicating strong costs of the lingering immunopathology. We show that these substantial sexually-concordant fitness effects of immune response act to align multivariate selection across the sexes, masking the signature of sexual antagonism that acted on morphology alone. Although both sexes experienced costs of fibrosis, the net impacts are unequal because in the two study populations females had higher cestode exposure. To evaluate whether this difference in risk should drive sex-specific immune strategies, we analyze a quantitative genetic model of host immune response to a trophically transmitted parasite. The model and empirical data illustrate how shared costs and benefits of immune response lead to shared evolutionary interests of male and female hosts, despite unequal infection risks across the sexes.","journal":"bioRxiv","reference":"Stephen P De Lisle, Daniel I Bolnick.

This study investigated the spatiotemporal distribution of diarrheal disease in the country and how associated it is with climate variables. Using monthly aggregated new cases of acute diarrhea reported between 2010 and 2016 and monthly averaged climate data at the district level, we fitted a hierarchical Bayesian spatiotemporal statistical model. We found aridity and mean daily temperature were positively associated with diarrhea incidence; every 1\u00b0C increase in mean daily temperature and 0.01-unit change in the aridity index were associated with a 0.70% (CI: 0.67%, 0.73%) increase and a 4.79% (CI: 4.30%, 5.26%) increase in the risk of diarrhea, respectively. Average annual temperature, on the other hand, was negatively associated, with a 3.7% (CI: 3.74%, 3.68) decrease in risk for every degree Celsius increase in annual average temperature. Temporally, most districts exhibited similar seasonal trends, with incidence peaking in summer, except for the eastern region where differences in climate patterns and population density may be associated with high rates of diarrhea throughout the year.

This study attempts to explore the epidemiological profile and quantify the climate-induced influence on malaria cases in the context of tropical states, taking Meghalaya and Tripura as study areas. Monthly malaria cases and meteorological data from 2011 to 2018 and 2013 to 2019 were collected from the states of Meghalaya and Tripura, respectively. The nonlinear associations between individual and synergistic effect of meteorological factors and malaria cases were assessed, and climate-based malaria prediction models were developed using the generalized additive model (GAM) with Gaussian distribution. During the study period, a total of 216,943 and 125,926 cases were recorded in Meghalaya and Tripura, respectively, and majority of the cases occurred due to the infection of Plasmodium falciparum in both the states. The temperature and relative humidity in Meghalaya and temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, and soil moisture in Tripura showed a significant nonlinear effect on malaria; moreover, the synergistic effects of temperature and relative humidity (SI=2.37, RERI=0.58, AP=0.29) and temperature and rainfall (SI=6.09, RERI=2.25, AP=0.61) were found to be the key determinants of malaria transmission in Meghalaya and Tripura, respectively. The developed climate-based malaria prediction models are able to predict the malaria cases accurately in both Meghalaya (RMSE: 0.0889; R2: 0.944) and Tripura (RMSE: 0.0451; R2: 0.884). The study found that not only the individual climatic factors can significantly increase the risk of malaria transmission but also the synergistic effects of climatic factors can drive the malaria transmission multifold.

This process unfolds in three phases: initiation, amplification, and propagation, ultimately leading to thrombin formation. Coagulation begins when tissue factor (TF) is exposed on an injured vessel's wall. The first step is when activated factor VII (VIIa) in the plasma binds to TF, forming complex TF:VIIa, which activates factor X. Activated factor X (Xa) is necessary for coagulation, so the regulation of its activation is crucial. Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) is a critical regulator of the initiation phase as it inhibits the activation of factor X. While previous studies have proposed two pathways-direct and indirect binding-for TFPI's inhibitory role, the specific biochemical reactions and their rates remain ambiguous. Many existing mathematical models only assume an indirect pathway, which may be less effective under physiological flow conditions. In this study, we revisit datasets from two experiments focused on activated factor X formation in the presence of TFPI. We employ an adaptive Metropolis method for parameter estimation to reinvestigate a previously proposed biochemical scheme and corresponding rates for both inhibition pathways. Our findings show that both pathways are essential to replicate the static experimental results. Previous studies have suggested that flow itself makes a significant contribution to the inhibition of factor X activation. We added flow to this model with our estimated parameters to determine the contribution of the two inhibition pathways under these conditions. We found that direct binding of TFPI is necessary for inhibition under flow. The indirect pathway has a weaker inhibitory effect due to removal of solution phase inhibitory complexes by flow.","journal":"PLoS computational biology","reference":"Santiago F, Kaur A, Bride S, Monroe D, Leiderman K, Sindi S.

The US Census County Business Patterns dataset for 2011 was used to construct various indices of food environments for selected metropolitan areas. The numbers of employees engaged in supermarkets, convenience stores, full service restaurants, fast food restaurants, and snack\/coffee shops were standardised using the location quotients, and factor analysis was used to produce two uncorrelated factors measuring food environments. Data on obesity were obtained from the 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Individual level obesity measures were linked to the metropolitan area level food environment factors. Models were fitted using generalised estimating equations to control for metropolitan area level intra-correlation and individual level sociodemographic characteristics. It was found that adults residing in cities with a large share of supermarket and full-service restaurant workers were less likely to be obese, while adults residing in cities with a large share of convenience store and fast food restaurant workers were more likely to be obese. Supermarkets and full-service restaurant workers are concentrated in the Northeast and West of the US, where obesity prevalence is relatively lower, while convenience stores and fast-food restaurant workers are concentrated in the South and Midwest, where obesity prevalence is relatively higher. The food environment landscapes measured at the metropolitan area level explain the continental-scale patterns of obesity prevalence. The types of food that are readily available and widely served may translate into obesity disparities across metropolitan areas. ","journal":"Geospatial health","reference":"Michimi A, Wimberly MC.

Ecological metabolic theory suggests that species living at higher temperatures evolve higher growth rates than those in cooler niches due to thermodynamic constraints. Here, using a global prokaryotic dataset, we find that maximal growth rate at thermal optimum increases with temperature for mesophiles (temperature optima [Formula: see text]C), but not thermophiles ([Formula: see text]C). Furthermore, short-term (within-day) thermal responses of prokaryotic metabolic rates are typically more sensitive to warming than those of eukaryotes. Because climatic warming will mostly impact ecosystems in the mesophilic temperature range, we conclude that as microbial communities adapt to higher temperatures, their metabolic rates and therefore, biomass-specific CO[Formula: see text] production, will inevitably rise. Using a mathematical model, we illustrate the potential global impacts of these findings.","journal":"Nature communications","reference":"Smith TP, Thomas TJH, Garc\u00eda-Carreras B, Sal S, Yvon-Durocher G, Bell T, Pawar S.

Using rich viral genomic data sets, we show that periods of steadily rising diversity have been punctuated by sudden, enormous increases followed by similarly abrupt collapses of diversity. We introduce a mechanistic model of saltational evolution with epistasis and demonstrate that these features parsimoniously account for the observed temporal dynamics of inter-genomic diversity. Our results provide support for recent proposals that saltational evolution may be a signature feature of SARS-CoV-2, allowing the pathogen to more readily evolve highly transmissible variants. These findings lend theoretical support to a heightened awareness of biological contexts where increased diversification may occur.

Due to limited empirical data, existing analyses assessing school-based interventions in pandemic situations often impose strong assumptions, for example, on the relationship between class size and transmission risk, which could bias the estimated effect of interventions, such as split classes and staggered attendance. To fill this gap in school outbreak studies, we parameterized an individual-based model that accounts for heterogeneous contact rates within and between classes and grades to a multischool outbreak data of influenza. We then simulated school outbreaks of respiratory infectious diseases of ongoing threat (i.e., COVID-19) and potential threat (i.e., pandemic influenza) under a variety of interventions (changing class structures, symptom screening, regular testing, cohorting, and responsive class closures). Our results suggest that interventions changing class structures (e.g., reduced class sizes) may not be effective in reducing the risk of major school outbreaks upon introduction of a case and that other precautionary measures (e.g., screening and isolation) need to be employed. Class-level closures in response to detection of a case were also suggested to be effective in reducing the size of an outbreak.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","reference":"Endo \u9060\u85e4\u5f70 A, , Uchida \u5185\u7530\u6e80\u592b M, Liu \u5218\u626c Y, Atkins KE, Kucharski AJ, Funk S.

An ensemble of transmission models then predicts the estimated reduction in dengue transmission following a nationwide roll-out of wMel Wolbachia.These results suggest interventions targeted to the highest burden cities can have a disproportionate impact on dengue burden. Area-wide interventions, such as Wolbachia, that are deployed based on the area covered could protect people more efficiently than individual-based interventions, such as vaccines, in such dense environments.Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes reduce dengue virus transmission, and city-wide releases in Yogyakarta city, Indonesia, are showing promising entomological results.

We used mass testing data for lateral flow device (LFD; data for approximately 290 million tests performed and reported) and PCR (data for approximately 107 million tests performed and returned from the laboratory) tests made available for the general public and provided by date and self-reported age and ethnicity at the lower tier local authority (LTLA) level. We also used publicly available data on mean population size estimates for individual LTLAs, and data on ethnic groups, age groups, and deprivation indices for LTLAs. We did not have access to REACT-1 or ONS-CIS prevalence data disaggregated by sex or gender. Using a mechanistic causal model to debias the PCR testing data, we obtained estimates of weekly SARS-CoV-2 prevalence by both self-reported ethnic groups and age groups for LTLAs in England. This approach to debiasing the PCR (or LFD) testing data also estimated a testing bias parameter defined as the odds of testing in infected versus not infected individuals, which would be close to zero if the likelihood of test seeking (or seeking and reporting) was the same regardless of infection status. With confirmatory PCR data, we estimated false positivity rates, sensitivity, specificity, and the rate of decline in detection probability subsequent to reporting a positive LFD for PCR tests by sociodemographic groups. We also estimated the daily incidence, allowing us to calculate the fraction of cases captured by the testing programme.Understanding underlying mechanisms of heterogeneity in test-seeking and reporting behaviour during an infectious disease outbreak can help to protect vulnerable populations and guide equity-driven interventions. The COVID-19 pandemic probably exerted different stresses on individuals in different sociodemographic groups and ensuring fair access to and usage of COVID-19 tests was a crucial element of England's testing programme. We aimed to investigate the relationship between sociodemographic factors and COVID-19 testing behaviours in England during the COVID-19 pandemic.From March, 2021 onwards, individuals in the most deprived regions reported approximately half as many LFD tests per capita as individuals in the least deprived areas (median ratio 0\u00b750 [IQR 0\u00b744-0\u00b754]). During the period October, 2020, to June, 2021, PCR testing patterns showed the opposite trend, with individuals in the most deprived areas performing almost double the number of PCR tests per capita than those in the least deprived areas (1\u00b78 [1\u00b77-1\u00b79]). Infection prevalences in Asian or Asian British individuals were considerably higher than those of other ethnic groups during the alpha (B.1.1.7) and omicron (B.1.1.529) BA.1 waves. Our estimates indicate that the England Pillar 2 COVID-19 testing programme detected 26-40% of all cases (including asymptomatic cases) over the study period with no consistent differences by deprivation levels or ethnic groups. Testing biases for PCR were generally higher than those for LFDs, in line with the general policy of symptomatic and asymptomatic use of these tests. Deprivation and age were associated with testing biases on average; however, the uncertainty intervals overlapped across deprivation levels, although the age-specific patterns were more distinct. We also found that ethnic minorities and older individuals were less likely to use confirmatory PCR tests through most of the pandemic and that delays in reporting a positive LFD test were possibly longer in populations self-reporting as \"Black; African; Black British or Caribbean\".Differences in testing behaviours across sociodemographic groups might be reflective of the higher costs of self-isolation to vulnerable populations, differences in test accessibility, differences in digital literacy, and differing perceptions about the utility of tests and risks posed by infection. This study shows how mass testing data can be used in conjunction with surveillance surveys to identify gaps in the uptake of public health interventions both at fine-scale levels and across sociodemographic groups. It provides a framework for monitoring local interventions and yields valuable lessons for policy makers in ensuring an equitable response to future pandemics.UK Health Security Agency.","journal":"The Lancet.

Anticipating the eradication of wild poliovirus (WPV) and the subsequent challenges in preventing its re-emergence, we look to the past to identify why polio rose to epidemic levels in the mid-20th century, and how WPV persisted over large geographic scales. We analyzed an extensive epidemiological dataset, spanning the 1930s to the 1950s and spatially replicated across each state in the United States, to glean insight into the drivers of polio's historical expansion and the ecological mode of its persistence prior to vaccine introduction. We document a latitudinal gradient in polio's seasonality. Additionally, we fitted and validated mechanistic transmission models to data from each US state independently. The fitted models revealed that: (1) polio persistence was the product of a dynamic mosaic of source and sink populations; (2) geographic heterogeneity of seasonal transmission conditions account for the latitudinal structure of polio epidemics; (3) contrary to the prevailing \"disease of development\" hypothesis, our analyses demonstrate that polio's historical expansion was straightforwardly explained by demographic trends rather than improvements in sanitation and hygiene; and (4) the absence of clinical disease is not a reliable indicator of polio transmission, because widespread polio transmission was likely in the multiyear absence of clinical disease.

A number of municipalities have proposed or initiated policies to stem the bed bug epidemic, but little guidance is available to evaluate them. One contentious policy is disclosure, whereby landlords are obligated to notify potential tenants of current or prior bed bug infestations. Aimed to protect tenants from leasing an infested rental unit, disclosure also creates a kind of quarantine, partially and temporarily removing infested units from the market. Here, we develop a mathematical model for the spread of bed bugs in a generalized rental market, calibrate it to parameters of bed bug dispersion and housing turnover, and use it to evaluate the costs and benefits of disclosure policies to landlords. We find disclosure to be an effective control policy to curb infestation prevalence. Over the short term (within 5 years), disclosure policies result in modest increases in cost to landlords, while over the long term, reductions of infestation prevalence lead, on average, to savings. These results are insensitive to different assumptions regarding the prevalence of infestation, rate of introduction of bed bugs from other municipalities, and the strength of the quarantine effect created by disclosure. Beyond its application to bed bugs, our model offers a framework to evaluate policies to curtail the spread of household pests and is appropriate for systems in which spillover effects result in highly nonlinear cost-benefit relationships.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","reference":"Xie S, Hill AL, Rehmann CR, Levy MZ.

We find that the introduction of NPIs leads to a strong initial reduction in incidence, but this effect is transient: As susceptibility increases, epidemics return while NPIs are in place. For low R0 infections, these return epidemics are of reduced equilibrium incidence and epidemic peak size. For high R0 infections, return epidemics are of similar magnitude to pre-NPI outbreaks.

With recent advances in data collection practices, empirical evidence about the efficacy of highly localized containment and intervention activities, which can lead to optimal deployment of resources, is possible. However, there are several challenges in analyzing data from such real-world observational settings. Using data on 3.9 million instances of seven dengue vector containment activities collected between 2012 and 2017, here we develop and assess two frameworks for understanding how the generation of new dengue cases changes in space and time with respect to application of different types of containment activities. Accounting for the non-random deployment of each containment activity in relation to dengue cases and other types of containment activities, as well as deployment of activities in different epidemiological contexts, results from both frameworks reinforce existing knowledge about the efficacy of containment activities aimed at the adult phase of the mosquito lifecycle. Results show a 10% (95% CI: 1-19%) and 20% reduction (95% CI: 4-34%) reduction in probability of a case occurring in 50 meters and 30 days of cases which had Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) and fogging performed in the immediate vicinity, respectively, compared to cases of similar epidemiological context and which had no containment in their vicinity. Simultaneously, limitations due to the real-world nature of activity deployment are used to guide recommendations for future deployment of resources during outbreaks as well as data collection practices.

Recombination may maintain coherent species of frequently recombining bacteria, but the emergence of distinct clusters within a recombining species, and the impact of habitat structure in this process are not well described, limiting our understanding of how new species are created. Here we present a model of bacterial evolution in overlapping habitat space. We show that the amount of habitat overlap determines the outcome for a pair of clusters, which may range from fast clonal divergence with little interaction between the clusters to a stationary population structure, where different clusters maintain an equilibrium distance between each other for an indefinite time. We fit our model to two data sets. In Streptococcus pneumoniae, we find a genomically and ecologically distinct subset, held at a relatively constant genetic distance from the majority of the population through frequent recombination with it, while in Campylobacter jejuni, we find a minority population we predict will continue to diverge at a higher rate. This approach may predict and define speciation trajectories in multiple bacterial species.","journal":"PLoS computational biology","reference":"Marttinen P, Hanage WP. (2017).

Clinical trials of these vaccines in this population may be warranted.High-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV3) or recombinant trivalent influenza vaccine (RIV) may increase influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) in adults with conditions that place them at high risk for influenza complications. This analysis models the public health impact and cost-effectiveness (CE) of these vaccines for 50-64year-olds.The least expensive strategy was SD-IIV3 only, with total costs of $99.84\/person. The SD-IIV4 only strategy cost an additional $0.91\/person, or $37,700\/QALY gained. The HD-IIV3 & SD-IIV4 strategy cost $1.06 more than SD-IIV4 only, or $71,500\/QALY gained. No vaccination and HD-IIV3 & SD-IIV3 strategies were dominated. Results were sensitive to influenza incidence, vaccine cost, standard-dose VE in the entire population and high-dose VE in high-risk patients. The CE of RIV for high-risk patients was dependent on as yet unknown parameter values.Markov model CE analysis compared 5 strategies in 50-64year-olds: no vaccination; only standard-dose IIV3 offered (SD-IIV3 only), only quadrivalent influenza vaccine offered (SD-IIV4 only); high-risk patients receiving HD-IIV3, others receiving SD-IIV3 (HD-IIV3 & SD-IIV3); and high-risk patients receiving HD-IIV3, others receiving SD-IIV4 (HD-IIV3 & SD-IIV4).

The value of information gains and losses may vary with each collaborative effort's aims, depending on the needs of projection users. Understanding the differing information potential of methods to collect model projections can support the accuracy, sustainability, and communication of collaborative infectious disease modelling efforts.By collecting modelled trajectories, we showed policy-relevant epidemic characteristics. Trajectories contained a right-skewed distribution well represented by an ensemble of trajectories or a linear opinion pool, but not models' quantile intervals. Ensembles weighted by performance typically retained the range of plausible incidence over time, and in some cases narrowed this by excluding some epidemic shapes.We compared projections from the European COVID-19 Scenario Modelling Hub. Five teams modelled incidence in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Spain. We compared July 2022 projections by incidence, peaks, and cumulative totals. We created a probabilistic ensemble drawn from all trajectories, and compared to ensembles from a median across each model's quantiles, or a linear opinion pool. We measured the predictive accuracy of individual trajectories against observations, using this in a weighted ensemble. We repeated this sequentially against increasing weeks of observed data. We evaluated these ensembles to reflect performance with varying observed data.Collaborative comparisons and combinations of epidemic models are used as policy-relevant evidence during epidemic outbreaks. In the process of collecting multiple model projections, such collaborations may gain or lose relevant information. Typically, modellers contribute a probabilistic summary at each time-step.

In the presence of domestic animal reservoirs, gHAT EOT may not be achieved under current control strategies.. To evaluate the utility of a One Health approach to gHAT and rHAT EOT, we built and parameterized a compartmental stochastic model, using the Institute for Disease Modeling's Compartmental Modeling Software, to six HAT epidemics: the national rHAT epidemics in Uganda and Malawi, the national gHAT epidemics in Uganda and South Sudan, and two separate gHAT epidemics in Democratic Republic of Congo distinguished by dominant vector species. In rHAT foci the reservoir animal sub-model was stratified on four species groups, while in gHAT foci domestic swine were assumed to be the only competent reservoir. The modeled time horizon was 2005-2045, with calibration performed using HAT surveillance data and Optuna. Interventions included insecticide and trypanocide treatment of domestic animal reservoirs at varying coverage levels.. Validation against HAT surveillance data indicates favorable performance overall, with the possible exception of DRC. EOT was not observed in any modeled scenarios for rHAT, however insecticide treatment consistently performed better than trypanocide treatment in terms of rHAT control. EOT was not observed for gHAT at 0% coverage of domestic reservoirs with trypanocides or insecticides, but was observed by 2030 in all test scenarios; again, insecticides demonstrated superior performance to trypanocides.. In response to large strides in the control of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), in the early 2000s the WHO set targets for elimination of both the gambiense (gHAT) and rhodesiense (rHAT) forms as a public health (EPHP) problem by 2020, and elimination of gHAT transmisson (EOT) by 2030. While global EPHP targets have been met, and EOT appears within reach, current control strategies may fail to achieve gHAT EOT in the presence of animal reservoirs, the role of which is currently uncertain. Furthermore, rHAT is not targeted for EOT due to the known importance of animal reservoirs for this form.","journal":"Acta tropica","reference":"Meisner J, Kato A, Lemerani MM, Miaka EM, Ismail AT, Wakefield J, Rowhani-Rahbar A, Pigott D, Mayer JD, Lorton C, Rabinowitz PM.

Higher resolution clusters computed using our network based approach and population models provide new insights on the structure and characteristics of such clusters and enable targeted interventions.We find 2 significant under-vaccinated clusters in MN and 3 in WA. These are very irregular in shape, in contrast to the circular disks reported in prior work, which rely on the SatScan approach. Some of the clusters found by our method are not contained in those computed using SatScan, a state-of-the-art software tool used in similar studies in other states.Clusters of under-vaccinated children are emerging in a number of states in the United States due to rising rates of vaccine hesitancy and refusal. As the measles outbreaks in California and other states in 2015 and in Minnesota in 2017 showed, such clusters can pose a significant public health risk. Prior methods have used publicly-available school immunization data for analysis (except for a few, which use private healthcare patient records). School immunization data has limited demographic information-as a result, such analyses are not able to provide demographic characteristics of significant clusters. Further, the resolution of the clusters identified by prior methods is limited since they are typically restricted to disks or well-rounded shapes.We use realistic population models for Minnesota (MN) and Washington (WA) state, which provide a model of activities for all individuals in the population. We combine this with school level immunization data for these two states, to estimate vaccine coverage at the level of census block groups. A scan statistic method defined on networks is used for finding significant clusters of under-immunized block groups, without any restrictions on shape.

Among them, temperature has consistently been found to be impactful in transmission dynamics, and models that incorporate temperature have been widely used to evaluate and forecast transmission or arboviruses like dengue, zika, or chikungunya virus. Further, there is growing evidence of the importance of micro-environmental temperatures in driving transmission of Aedes aegypti-borne viruses, as these mosquitoes tend to live within domiciles. Yet there is still a considerable gap in our understanding of how accounting for micro-environmental temperatures in models varies from the use of other widely-used, macro-level temperature measures. This effort combines field-collected data of both indoor and outdoor household associated temperatures and weather station temperature data from three Colombian cities to describe the relationship between the measures representing temperature at the micro- and macro-levels. These data indicate that weather station data may not accurately capture the temperature profiles of indoor micro-environments. However, using these data sources, the basic reproductive number for arboviruses was calculated by means of three modeling efforts to investigate whether temperature measure differences translated to differential transmission predictions. Across all three cities, it was determined that the modeling method was more often impactful rather than the temperature data-source, though no consistent pattern was immediately clear. This suggests that temperature data sources and modeling methods are important for precision in arbovirus transmission predictions, and more studies are needed to parse out this complex interaction.","journal":"Microorganisms","reference":"Pe\u00f1a-Garc\u00eda VH, Luvall JC, Christofferson RC.

Nonetheless, these areas remain vulnerable to the reintroduction of malaria parasites and the reestablishment of indigenous transmission. As such, prevention of reestablishment (POR) planning is of increasing concern to ensure timely response to increasing cases. A thorough understanding of both the risk of parasite importation and receptivity for transmission is essential for successful POR planning. Routine geolocated case- and foci-level epidemiological and case-level demographic data were extracted from Thailand's national malaria information system for all active foci from October 2012 to September 2020. A spatial analysis examined environmental and climate factors associated with the remaining active foci. A logistic regression model collated surveillance data with remote sensing data to investigate associations with the probability of having reported an indigenous case within the previous year. Active foci are highly concentrated along international borders, particularly Thailand's western border with Myanmar. Although there is heterogeneity in the habitats surrounding active foci, land covered by tropical forest and plantation was significantly higher for active foci than other foci. The regression results showed that tropical forest, plantations, forest disturbance, distance from international borders, historical foci classification, percentage of males, and percentage of short-term residents were associated with the high probability of reporting indigenous cases. These results confirm that Thailand's emphasis on border areas and forest-going populations is well placed. The results suggest that environmental factors alone are not driving malaria transmission in Thailand; rather, other factors, including demographics and behaviors that intersect with exophagic vectors, may also be contributors. However, these factors are syndemic, so human activities in areas covered by tropical forests and plantations may result in malaria importation and, potentially, local transmission, in foci that had previously been cleared. These factors should be addressed in POR planning.","journal":"Tropical medicine and infectious disease","reference":"Prempree P, Bisanzio D, Sudathip P, Kanjanasuwan J, Powell I, Gopinath D, Suttiwong C, Pinyajeerapat N, Poortinga A, Sintasath D, Shah JA.

We analyze the epidemiological impact of pandemic fatigue by using the large and detailed cross-sectional telephone surveys to quantify risk perception and self-reported protective behaviors and mathematical models to incorporate population protective behaviors.

The preferences and social dynamics of a population can have a large impact on the course of an outbreak as well as the effectiveness of interventions intended to influence individual behavior. In addition, individuals may alter their sexual behavior in response to the presence of STIs, creating a feedback loop between transmission and behavior. We investigate the consequences of modeling the interaction between STI transmission and prophylactic use with a model that links a Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) system to evolutionary game dynamics that determine the effective contact rate. The combined model framework allows us to address protective behavior by both infected and susceptible individuals. Feedback between behavioral adaptation and prevalence creates a wide range of dynamic behaviors in the combined model, including damped and sustained oscillations as well as bistability, depending on the behavioral parameters and disease growth rate. We found that disease extinction is possible for multiple regions where R0>1, due to behavior adaptation driving the epidemic downward, although conversely endemic prevalence for arbitrarily low R0 is also possible if contact rates are sufficiently high. We also tested how model misspecification might affect disease forecasting and estimation of the model parameters and R0. We found that alternative models that neglect the behavioral feedback or only consider behavior adaptation by susceptible individuals can potentially yield misleading parameter estimates or omit significant features of the disease trajectory.

Systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies are performed, analysing literature that epidemiologically examined the relationship between condom use and sexual contact pattern. Subsequently, we employ an epidemiological model and compute the reproduction number that accounts for with and without concurrency so that the corresponding coverage of condom use and its correlation with existence of concurrency can be explicitly investigated using the mathematical model. Combining the model with parameters estimated from the meta-analysis along with other assumed parameters, the impact of varying the proportion of population with multiple partners on the reproduction number is examined.Based on systematic review, we show that a greater number of people used condoms during sexual contact with casual partners than with steady partners. Furthermore, people with multiple partners use condoms more frequently than people with a single partner alone. Our mathematical model revealed a positive relationship between the effective reproduction number and the proportion of people with multiple partners. Nevertheless, the association was reversed to be negative by employing a slightly greater value of the relative risk of condom use for people with multiple partners than that empirically estimated.It is believed that sexually active people, i.e. people having multiple or concurrent sexual partners, are at a high risk of sexually transmitted infections (STI), but they are likely to be more aware of the risk and may exhibit greater fraction of the use of condom. The purpose of the present study is to examine the correlation between condom use and sexual contact pattern and clarify its impact on the transmission dynamics of STIs using a mathematical model.","journal":"Theoretical biology & medical modelling","reference":"Yamamoto N, Ejima K, Nishiura H.

The ongoing epidemic of white-nose syndrome is a multi-scale phenomenon becau.se it causes hibernaculum-level extirpations, while simultaneously spreading over larger spatial scales. We investigate a neglected topic in ecological epidemiology: how local pathogen-driven extirpations impact large-scale pathogen spread. Previous studies have identified risk factors for propagation of WNS over hibernaculum and landscape scales but none of these have tested the hypothesis that separation of spatial scales and disease-induced mortality at the hibernaculum level might slow or halt its spread. To test this hypothesis, we developed a mechanistic multi-scale model parameterized using white-nose syndrome.county and site incidence data that connects hibernaculum-level susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) epidemiology to the county-scale contagion process. Our key result is that hibernaculum-level extirpations will not inhibit county-scale spread of WNS. We show that over 80% of counties of the contiguous USA are likely to become infected before the current epidemic is over and that geometry of habitat connectivity is such that host refuges are exceedingly rare. The macroscale spatiotemporal infection pattern that emerges from local SIR epidemiological processes falls within a narrow spectrum of possible outcomes, suggesting that recolonization, rescue effects, and multi-host complexities at local scales are not important to forward propagation of WNS at large spatial scales. If effective control measures are not implemented, precipitous declines in bat populations are likely, particularly in cave-dense regions that constitute the main geographic corridors of the USA, a serious concern for bat conservation.","journal":"Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America","reference":"O'Reagan SM, Magori K, Pulliam JT, Zokan MA, Kaul RB, Barton HD, Drake JM.

Recent work characterizing these temperature dependencies has highlighted how climate change may impact geographic disease spread. We extend this prior work by examining how newly emerging diseases, like Zika, will be impacted by specific future climate change scenarios in four diverse regions of Brazil, a country that has been profoundly impacted by Zika. We estimated a [Formula: see text], derived from a compartmental transmission model, characterizing Zika (and, for comparison, dengue) transmission potential as a function of temperature-dependent biological parameters specific to Aedes aegypti. We obtained historical temperature data for the five-year period 2015-2019 and projections for 2045-2049 by fitting cubic spline interpolations to data from simulated atmospheric data provided by the CMIP-6 project (specifically, generated by the GFDL-ESM4 model), which provides projections under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP). These four SSP scenarios correspond to varying levels of climate change severity. We applied this approach to four Brazilian cities (Manaus, Recife, Rio de Janeiro, and S\u00e3o Paulo) that represent diverse climatic regions. Our model predicts that the [Formula: see text] for Zika peaks at 2.7 around 30\u00b0C, while for dengue it peaks at 6.8 around 31\u00b0C. We find that the epidemic potential of Zika will increase beyond current levels in Brazil in all of the climate scenarios. For Manaus, we predict that the annual [Formula: see text] range will increase from 2.1-2.5, to 2.3-2.7, for Recife we project an increase from 0.4-1.9 to 0.6-2.3, for Rio de Janeiro from 0-1.9 to 0-2.3, and for S\u00e3o Paulo from 0-0.3 to 0-0.7.

We developed a transmission-dynamic stochastic microsimulation parameterised by the California data and published literature. After an initial infection is introduced to a prison, the model evaluates the effect of various policy scenarios on infections and hospitalisations over 200 days. Scenarios vary by vaccine coverage, baseline immunity (0%, 25%, or 50%), resumption of activities, and use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that reduce transmission by 75%. We simulated five prison types that differ by residential layout and demographics, and estimated outcomes with and without repeated infection introductions over the 200 days.Residents of prisons have experienced disproportionate COVID-19-related health harms. To control outbreaks, many prisons in the USA restricted in-person activities, which are now resuming even as viral variants proliferate. This study aims to use mathematical modelling to assess the risks and harms of COVID-19 outbreaks in prisons under a range of policies, including resumption of activities.If a viral variant is introduced into a prison that has resumed pre-2020 contact levels, has moderate vaccine coverage (ranging from 36% to 76% among residents, dependent on age, with 40% coverage for staff), and has no baseline immunity, 23-74% of residents are expected to be infected over 200 days. High vaccination coverage (90%) coupled with NPIs reduces cumulative infections to 2-54%. Even in prisons with low room occupancies (ie, no more than two occupants) and low levels of cumulative infections (ie, 20% of residents infected) are substantially higher if infections are repeatedly introduced.Horowitz Family Foundation, National Institute on Drug Abuse, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Science Foundation, Open Society Foundation, Advanced Micro Devices.Balancing benefits of resuming activities against risks of outbreaks presents challenging trade-offs.

Despite high scientific and public interest and multiple research reports, there is currently no consensus on the association of environmental factors and SARS-CoV-2 transmission. To address this research gap, we aimed to assess the relative risk of transmission associated with weather conditions and ambient air pollution.Warmer temperature and moderate outdoor ultraviolet exposure result in a slight reduction in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2; however, changes in weather or air pollution alone are not enough to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 with other factors having greater effects.Our dataset included data collected between Dec 12, 2019, and April 22, 2020. Several weather variables and ambient air pollution were associated with the spread of SARS-CoV-2 across 3739 global locations. We found a moderate, negative relationship between the estimated reproduction number and temperatures warmer than 25\u00b0C (a decrease of 3\u00b77% [95% CI 1\u00b79-5\u00b74] per additional degree), a U-shaped relationship with outdoor ultraviolet exposure, and weaker positive associations with air pressure, wind speed, precipitation, diurnal temperature, sulphur dioxide, and ozone. Results were robust to multiple assumptions. Independent research building on our estimates provides strong support for the resulting projections across nations.In this global analysis, we adjusted for the delay between infection and detection, estimated the daily reproduction number at 3739 global locations during the COVID-19 pandemic up until late April, 2020, and investigated its associations with daily local weather conditions (ie, temperature, humidity, precipitation, snowfall, moon illumination, sunlight hours, ultraviolet index, cloud cover, wind speed and direction, and pressure data) and ambient air pollution (ie, PM2\u00b75, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and sulphur dioxide). To account for other confounding factors, we included both location-specific fixed effects and trends, controlling for between-location differences and heterogeneities in locations' responses over time.

Many national vaccine recommendations focus on high-risk groups, elderly populations, and healthcare workers despite previous analyses demonstrating broad benefits to vaccinating younger high-contact age groups. In this study, we parameterized an age-structured nonseasonal asynchronous epidemiological model of influenza virus transmission for a tropical low-income setting. We evaluated timing and age allocation of vaccines across vaccine supplies ranging from 10 to 90% using decade-based age groups. Year-round vaccination was beneficial when compared with more concentrated annual vaccine distribution. When targeting a single age group for vaccine prioritization, maximum vaccine allocation to the 10-19 high-contact age group minimized annual influenza mortality for all but one vaccine supply. When evaluating across all possible age allocations, optimal strategies always allocated a plurality of vaccines to school-age children (10-19). The converse, however, was not true as not all strategies allocating a plurality to children aged 10-19 minimized mortality. Allocating a high proportion of vaccine supply to the 10-19 age group is necessary but not sufficient to minimize annual mortality as distribution of remaining vaccine doses to other age groups also needs to be optimized. Strategies focusing on indirect benefits (vaccinating children) showed higher variance in mortality outcomes than strategies focusing on direct benefits (vaccinating the elderly). However, the indirect benefit approaches showed a lower mean mortality and a lower minimum mortality than vaccination focused on the elderly.","journal":"PNAS nexus","reference":"Servadio JL, Choisy M, Thai PQ, Boni MF.

We then used a synthetic population to estimate the neighborhood-level lung cancer risk to understand spatial clusters of increased homicide rates and lung cancer risk.Neighborhood violence was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. Black residents in Chicago are disproportionately exposed to neighborhood violence, which may partially explain the existing racial disparity in lung cancer. Incorporating neighborhood violence exposure into lung cancer risk models may help identify high-risk individuals who could benefit from lung cancer screening.Older age and former\/current smoking status were associated with increased odds of lung cancer diagnosis. Hispanic patients were more likely than White patients to be diagnosed with lung cancer, but there was no statistical difference between Black and White patients in lung cancer diagnosis. The odds of being diagnosed with lung cancer were significantly higher for patients living in areas with the third and fourth quartiles of homicide rates compared to the second quartile of homicide rates. Furthermore, significant spatial clusters of increased lung cancer risk and homicide rates were observed on Chicago's South and West sides.Despite the lower prevalence and frequency of smoking, Black adults are disproportionately affected by lung cancer. Exposure to chronic stress generates heightened immune responses, which creates a cell environment conducive to lung cancer development.

To investigate the impact of superspreaders on epidemic dynamics, we formulate deterministic and stochastic models that incorporate differences in superspreaders versus nonsuperspreaders. In particular, continuous-time Markov chain models are used to investigate epidemic features associated with the presence of superspreaders in a population. We parameterize the models for two case studies, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Ebola. Through mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, we find that the probability of outbreaks increases and time to outbreaks decreases as the prevalence of superspreaders increases in the population. In particular, as disease outbreaks occur more rapidly and more frequently when initiated by superspreaders, our results emphasize the need for expeditious public health interventions.","journal":"Understanding Complex Biological Systems with Mathematics","reference":"Christina J.

In this study, we consider different mass drug administration (MDA) strategies to maintain the goals.To reduce the risk of recrudescence after the goals are achieved, programs have to re-evaluate their strategies and decide to either maintain these goals with reduced efforts where feasible or continue with at least the same efforts required to reach the goals.We use two independently developed individual-based stochastic models of schistosomiasis transmission to assess the optimal treatment strategy of a multi-year program to maintain the morbidity control and the EPHP goals.","journal":"Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America","reference":"Ayabina D, Kura K, Toor J, Graham M, Anderson RM, Hollingsworth TD.

By applying the principles of small-area estimation to existing model formulations for excess mortality, this study develops a novel method for assessing excess mortality across small populations and assesses the pattern of COVID excess mortality by province, year, week, age group, and sex in Italy from March through May 2020. We estimate that 53,200 excess deaths occurred across Italy during this time period, compared to just 35,500 deaths where COVID-19 was registered as the underlying cause of death. Out of the total excess mortality burden, 97% of excess deaths occurred among adults over age 60, and 68% of excess deaths were concentrated among adults over age 80. The burden of excess mortality was unevenly distributed across the country, with just three of Italy's 107 provinces accounting for 32% of all excess mortality.

Determining the transition point of the disease trajectory to a more severe state is important clinically for disease management and for avoiding irreversible vision loss. Based on this, we present a unified statistical modeling framework that permits prediction of the timing and spatial location of future vision loss and informs clinical decisions regarding disease progression. The developed method incorporates anatomical information to create a biologically plausible data-generating model. We accomplish this by introducing a spatially varying coefficients model that includes spatially varying change points to detect structural shifts in both the mean and variance process of VF data across both space and time. The VF location-specific change point represents the underlying, and potentially censored, timing of true change in disease trajectory while a multivariate spatial boundary detection structure is introduced that accounts for the complex spatial connectivity of the VF and optic disc. We show that our method improves estimation and prediction of multiple aspects of disease management in comparison to existing methods through simulation and real data application.

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 spread across the world causing many waves of COVID-19. Children were at high risk of being exposed to the disease because they were not eligible for vaccination during the first 20 mo of the pandemic in the United States. While children 5 y and older are now eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States, vaccination rates remain low despite most schools returning to in-person instruction. Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are important for controlling the spread of COVID-19 in K-12 schools. US school districts used varied and layered mitigation strategies during the pandemic. The goal of this article is to analyze the impact of different NPIs on COVID-19 transmission within K-12 schools. Methods. We developed a deterministic stratified SEIR model that captures the role of social contacts between cohorts in disease transmission to estimate COVID-19 incidence under different NPIs including masks, random screening, contact reduction, school closures, and test-to-stay. We designed contact matrices to simulate the contact patterns between students and teachers within schools. We estimated the proportion of susceptible infected associated with each intervention over 1 semester under the Omicron variant. Results. We find that masks and reducing contacts can greatly reduce new infections among students. Weekly screening tests also have a positive impact on disease mitigation. While self-quarantining symptomatic infections and school closures are effective measures for decreasing semester-end infections, they increase absenteeism. Conclusion. The model provides a useful tool for evaluating the impact of a variety of NPIs on disease transmission in K-12 schools.

Comparable infection and transmission rates were observed in laboratory. The basic reproductive number (R0) was estimated in the range of 1.8-6 (2007) and 1.5-2.6 (2017). Clinical characteristics were similar between outbreaks, and no acute complications were reported, though a higher frequency of ocular symptoms, myalgia, and rash was observed in 2017. Very little is known about the immune mediator profile of CHIKV-infected patients during the 2 outbreaks. Regarding public health responses, after the 2007 outbreak, the Italian Ministry of Health developed national guidelines to implement surveillance and good practices to prevent and control autochthonous transmission. However, only a few regional authorities implemented it, and the perception of outbreak risk and knowledge of clinical symptoms and transmission dynamics by general practitioners remained low.Efforts should be devoted to developing suitable procedures for early detection of virus circulation in the population, possibly through the analysis of medical records in near real time. Increasing the awareness of CHIKV of general practitioners and public health officials through tailored education may be effective, especially in small coastal towns where the outbreak risk may be higher.

In the US, we estimate the number of symptomatic influenza illnesses to be 4.4-34 million in 2011-2012 and 23-102 million in 2012-2013.We use a dynamic disease transmission model, laboratory-confirmed influenza surveillance data, and randomized-controlled trial (RCT) data to quantify the underestimation factor, expansion factor, and symptomatic influenza illnesses in the US and Canada during the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 influenza seasons.Seasonal influenza poses a significant public health and economic burden, associated with the outcome of infection and resulting complications. The true burden of the disease is difficult to capture due to the wide range of presentation, from asymptomatic cases to non-respiratory complications such as cardiovascular events, and its seasonal variability. An understanding of the magnitude of the true annual incidence of influenza is important to support prevention and control policy development and to evaluate the impact of preventative measures such as vaccination.We illustrate that monitoring a representative group within a population may aid in effectively modelling the transmission of infectious diseases such as influenza. In particular, the utilization of RCTs in models may enhance the accuracy of epidemiological parameter estimation.","journal":"Theoretical biology & medical modelling","reference":"McCarthy Z, Athar S, Alavinejad M, Chow C, Moyles I, Nah K, Kong JD, Agrawal N, Jaber A, Keane L, Liu S, Nahirniak M, Jean DS, Romanescu R, Stockdale J, Seet BT, Coudeville L, Thommes E, Taurel AF, Lee J, Shin T, Arino J, Heffernan J, Chit A, Wu J.

When the population does not have preexisting immunity and the influenza season peaks in February (R0 1.2-1.6), moving individuals who currently received the vaccine after September to the end of September could avert an additional 9634-17,794 influenza cases, $0.6-$1.4 million in direct costs, $2.1-$4.0 million in productivity losses, and 35-64 QALYs. Moving the vaccination of just children to September (R0 1.2-1.6) averted 11,366-1660 influenza cases, $0.6-$0.03 million in direct costs, $2.3-$0.2 million in productivity losses, and 42-8 QALYs. Moving the season peak to December increased these benefits, whereas increasing preexisting immunity reduced these benefits.Even though many people are vaccinated well after September\/October, they likely are still vaccinated early enough to provide substantial cost-savings.We used real data on when individuals were vaccinated in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, and the following 2 models to determine the value of vaccinating individuals earlier (by the end of September, October, and November): Framework for Reconstructing Epidemiological Dynamics (FRED), an agent-based model (ABM), and FluEcon, our influenza economic model that translates cases from the ABM to outcomes and costs [health care and lost productivity costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)].

This issue is particularly pertinent in disease mapping, where small counts pose both inferential challenges and potential disclosure risks. While the small area estimation, disease mapping, and statistical disclosure limitation literatures are individually robust, there have been few intersections between them. Here, we formally propose the use of spatiotemporal data analysis methods to generate synthetic data for public use. Specifically, we analyze ten years of county-level heart disease death counts for multiple age-groups using a Bayesian model that accounts for dependence spatially, temporally, and between age-groups; generating synthetic data from the resulting posterior predictive distribution will preserve these dependencies.

We conducted a retrospective observational study by applying dynamic clinical data collected in the ARDSNet FACTT Trial (n\u2009=\u20091000) to ML-based algorithms for predicting mortality. In order to compare the significance of clinical features dynamically, we further applied the random forest (RF) model to nine selected clinical parameters acquired at baseline and day 3 independently. An RF model trained using clinical data collected at day 3 showed improved performance and prognostication efficacy (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.78-0.89) compared to baseline with an AUC value of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.65-0.78). Mean airway pressure (MAP), bicarbonate, age, platelet count, albumin, heart rate, and glucose were the most significant clinical indicators associated with mortality at day 3. Thus, clinical features collected early (day 3) improved performance of integrative ML models with better prognostication for mortality.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), seasonal influenza affects 5% to 20% of the U.S. population and causes major economic impacts resulting from hospitalization and absenteeism. Understanding influenza dynamics and forecasting its impact is fundamental for developing prevention and mitigation strategies. We combine modern data assimilation methods with Wikipedia access logs and CDC influenza-like illness (ILI) reports to create a weekly forecast for seasonal influenza. The methods are applied to the 2013-2014 influenza season but are sufficiently general to forecast any disease outbreak, given incidence or case count data. We adjust the initialization and parametrization of a disease model and show that this allows us to determine systematic model bias. In addition, we provide a way to determine where the model diverges from observation and evaluate forecast accuracy. Wikipedia article access logs are shown to be highly correlated with historical ILI records and allow for accurate prediction of ILI data several weeks before it becomes available. The results show that prior to the peak of the flu season, our forecasting method produced 50% and 95% credible intervals for the 2013-2014 ILI observations that contained the actual observations for most weeks in the forecast. However, since our model does not account for re-infection or multiple strains of influenza, the tail of the epidemic is not predicted well after the peak of flu season has passed.

A generalized linear model (GLM) was established to test the association between mobility volume (number of trips) and COVID-19 transmission. Subgroup analysis was also performed for sex, age, travel location, and travel distance. Statistical\u00a0interaction\u00a0terms were included\u00a0in a variety of models that express different relations between involved variables.This study aimed to quantify the impact of mobility reduction on COVID-19 transmission according to mobility distance, location, and demographic factors in order to identify hotspots of transmission and guide public health policies.Mobility restriction was one of the primary measures used to restrain the spread of COVID-19 globally. Governments implemented and relaxed various mobility restriction measures in the absence of evidence for almost 3 years, which caused severe adverse outcomes in terms of health, society, and economy.The GLM analysis demonstrated a significant association between the COVID-19 growth rate ratio (GR) and mobility volume. A stratification analysis revealed a higher effect of mobility volume on the COVID-19 GR among people aged 50-59 years (GR decrease of 13.17% per 10% reduction in mobility volume; P<.001) than among other age groups (GR decreases of 7.80%, 10.43%, 7.48%, 8.01%, and 10.43% for those aged \u226418, 19-29, 30-39, 40-49, and \u226560 years, respectively; P=.02 for the interaction). The impact of mobility reduction on COVID-19 transmission was higher for transit stations and shopping areas (instantaneous reproduction number [Rt] decreases of 0.67 and 0.53 per 10% reduction in mobility volume, respectively) than for workplaces, schools, recreation areas, and other locations (Rt decreases of 0.30, 0.37, 0.44, and 0.32, respectively; P=.02 for the interaction). The association between mobility volume reduction and COVID-19 transmission was lower with decreasing mobility distance as there was a significant interaction between mobility volume and mobility distance with regard to Rt (P<.001 for the interaction). Specifically, the percentage decreases in Rt per 10% reduction in mobility volume were 11.97% when mobility distance increased by 10% (Spring Festival), 6.74% when mobility distance remained unchanged, and 1.52% when mobility distance declined by 10%.The association between mobility reduction and COVID-19 transmission significantly varied according to mobility distance, location, and age. The substantially higher impact of mobility volume on COVID-19 transmission for longer travel distance, certain age groups, and specific travel locations highlights the potential to optimize the effectiveness of mobility restriction strategies.

Because SARS-CoV-2 can spread from individuals with pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, and asymptomatic infections, the re-opening of societies and the control of virus spread will be facilitated by robust surveillance, for which virus testing will often be central. After infection, individuals undergo a period of incubation during which viral titers are usually too low to detect, followed by an exponential growth of virus, leading to a peak viral load and infectiousness, and ending with declining viral levels and clearance. Given the pattern of viral load kinetics, we model surveillance effectiveness considering test sensitivities, frequency, and sample-to-answer reporting time. These results demonstrate that effective surveillance, including time to first detection and outbreak control, depends largely on frequency of testing and the speed of reporting, and is only marginally improved by high test sensitivity. We therefore conclude that surveillance should prioritize accessibility, frequency, and sample-to-answer time; analytical limits of detection should be secondary.","journal":"medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences","reference":"Larremore DB, Wilder B, Lester E, Shehata S, Burke JM, Hay JA, Tambe M, Mina MJ, Parker R.

Using patient EMR data as predictors, we derived hierarchical logistic regression (HLR) and standard logistic regression (LR) models to predict their relevance.Hierarchical models can yield better performance when there is physician-related variability as in the case of identifying relevant information in the EMR.Patient information can be retrieved more efficiently in electronic medical record (EMR) systems by using machine learning models that predict which information a physician will seek in a clinical context. However, information-seeking behavior varies across EMR users. To explicitly account for this variability, we derived hierarchical models and compared their performance to nonhierarchical models in identifying relevant patient information in intensive care unit (ICU) cases.In 73 pairs of HLR and LR models, the HLR models achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.80-0.82], which was statistically significantly higher than that of LR models (0.75, 95% CI [0.74-0.76]). Further, the HLR models achieved statistically significantly lower expected calibration error (0.07, 95% CI [0.06-0.08]) than LR models (0.16, 95% CI [0.14-0.17]).The physician reviewers demonstrated variability in selecting relevant data.

In this work, we study the dynamics of airborne transmission in consecutive meetings of individuals in enclosed spaces. In contrast to the usual pairwise-interaction models of infection where effective contacts transmit the disease, we focus on group interactions where individuals with distinct health states meet simultaneously. Specifically, the disease is transmitted by infected individuals exhaling droplets (contributing to the viral load in the closed space) and susceptible ones inhaling the contaminated air. We propose a modeling framework that couples the fast dynamics of the viral load attained over meetings in enclosed spaces and the slow dynamics of disease progression at the population level. Our modeling framework incorporates the multiple time scales involved in different setups in which indoor events may happen, from single-time events to events hosting multiple meetings per day, over many days. We present theoretical and numerical results of trade-offs between the room characteristics (ventilation system efficiency and air mass) and the group's behavioral and composition characteristics (group size, mask compliance, testing, meeting time, and break times), that inform indoor policies to achieve disease control in closed environments through different pathways. Our results emphasize the impact of break times, mask-wearing, and testing on facilitating the conditions to achieve disease control.

Scenarios of delay in vaccine introduction with limited vaccine efficacy and limited supplies are not unlikely in future influenza pandemics, as in the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. We simulated influenza pandemics in Chicago using agent-based transmission dynamic modeling. Population was distributed among high-risk and non-high risk among 0-19, 20-64 and 65+ years subpopulations. Different attack rate scenarios for catastrophic (30.15%), strong (21.96%), and moderate (11.73%) influenza pandemics were compared against vaccine intervention scenarios, at 40% coverage, 40% efficacy, and unit cost of $28.62. Sensitivity analysis for vaccine compliance, vaccine efficacy and vaccine start date was also conducted. Vaccine prioritization criteria include risk of death, total deaths, net benefits, and return on investment. The risk of death is the highest among the high-risk 65+ years subpopulation in the catastrophic influenza pandemic, and highest among the high-risk 0-19 years subpopulation in the strong and moderate influenza pandemics. The proportion of total deaths and net benefits are the highest among the high-risk 20-64 years subpopulation in the catastrophic, strong and moderate influenza pandemics. The return on investment is the highest in the high-risk 0-19 years subpopulation in the catastrophic, strong and moderate influenza pandemics. Based on risk of death and return on investment, high-risk groups of the three age group subpopulations can be prioritized for vaccination, and the vaccine interventions are cost saving for all age and risk groups. The attack rates among the children are higher than among the adults and seniors in the catastrophic, strong, and moderate influenza pandemic scenarios, due to their larger social contact network and homophilous interactions in school. Based on return on investment and higher attack rates among children, we recommend prioritizing children (0-19 years) and seniors (65+ years) after high-risk groups for influenza vaccination during times of limited vaccine supplies. Based on risk of death, we recommend prioritizing seniors (65+ years) after high-risk groups for influenza vaccination during times of limited vaccine supplies.","journal":"PLoS computational biology","reference":"Dorratoltaj N, Marathe A, Lewis BL, Swarup S, Eubank SG, Abbas KM.

One unanswered question is how infection is controlled and cleared during a dengue infection. Antibody is thought to play a role, but little past work has examined the kinetics of both virus and antibody during natural infections. We present data on multiple virus and antibody titres measurements recorded sequentially during infection from 53 Vietnamese dengue patients. We fit mechanistic mathematical models of the dynamics of viral replication and the host immune response to these data. These models fit the data well. The model with antibody removing virus fits the data best, but with a role suggested for ADCC or other infected cell clearance mechanisms. Our analysis therefore shows that the observed viral and antibody kinetics are consistent with antibody playing a key role in controlling viral replication. This work gives quantitative insight into the relationship between antibody levels and the efficiency of viral clearance. It will inform the future development of mechanistic models of how vaccines and antivirals might modify the course of natural dengue infection.","journal":"PLoS computational biology","reference":"Clapham HE, Quyen TH, Kien DT, Dorigatti I, Simmons CP, Ferguson NM.

Accurate forecasts of key features of influenza epidemics, such as the timing and severity of the peak incidence in a given season, can inform public health response to outbreaks. As part of ongoing efforts to incorporate data and advanced analytical methods into public health decision-making, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has organized seasonal influenza forecasting challenges since the 2013\/2014 season. In the 2017\/2018 season, 22 teams participated. A subset of four teams created a research consortium called the FluSight Network in early 2017. During the 2017\/2018 season they worked together to produce a collaborative multi-model ensemble that combined 21 separate component models into a single model using a machine learning technique called stacking. This approach creates a weighted average of predictive densities where the weight for each component is determined by maximizing overall ensemble accuracy over past seasons. In the 2017\/2018 influenza season, one of the largest seasonal outbreaks in the last 15 years, this multi-model ensemble performed better on average than all individual component models and placed second overall in the CDC challenge. It also outperformed the baseline multi-model ensemble created by the CDC that took a simple average of all models submitted to the forecasting challenge. This project shows that collaborative efforts between research teams to develop ensemble forecasting approaches can bring measurable improvements in forecast accuracy and important reductions in the variability of performance from year to year. Efforts such as this, that emphasize real-time testing and evaluation of forecasting models and facilitate the close collaboration between public health officials and modeling researchers, are essential to improving our understanding of how best to use forecasts to improve public health response to seasonal and emerging epidemic threats.","journal":"PLoS computational biology","reference":"Reich NG, McGowan CJ, Yamana TK, Tushar A, Ray EL, Osthus D, Kandula S, Brooks LC, Crawford-Crudell W, Gibson GC, Moore E, Silva R, Biggerstaff M, Johansson MA, Rosenfeld R, Shaman J.

Apixaban was shown to be safer than warfarin, with superior reduction in the risk of stroke, systemic embolism, mortality, and major bleeding irrespective of kidney function.To evaluate the cost-utility of apixaban compared with warfarin in AF patients at different levels of kidney function.A Markov model was used to estimate the cost effectiveness of apixaban compared with warfarin in AF patients at three levels of kidney function: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of more than 80 ml\/min, 50 to 80 ml\/min, and 50 ml\/min or less. Event rates and associated utilities were obtained from previous literature. The model adopted the US health care system perspective, with hospitalization costs extracted from the Healthcare and Utilization Project. Treatment costs were obtained from official price lists. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of results.Apixaban is a favorably cost-effective alternative to warfarin in AF patients with normal kidney function and potentially cost-saving in those with renal impairment.","journal":"Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research","reference":"Altawalbeh SM, Alshogran OY, Smith KJ.

Reducing air travel out of a source country has the most important effect regarding the spreading of the disease to the rest of the world.

Presumably, these policies assume that the unvaccinated are driving transmission, though it is not well understood how viral spread occurs in mixed-status populations. Here, we analyze a model of transmission in which a variable fraction of the population is vaccinated, with unvaccinated individuals proactively screened for infection. By exploring a range of transmission rates, vaccine effectiveness (VE) scenarios, and rates of prior infection, this analysis reveals principles of viral spread in communities of mixed vaccination status, with implications for screening policies. As vaccination rates increase, the proportion of transmission driven by the unvaccinated population decreases, such that most community spread is driven by breakthrough infections once vaccine coverage exceeds 55% (omicron) or 80% (delta), with additional variation dependent on waning or boosted VE. More broadly, the potential impacts of unvaccinated-only screening fall into three distinct parameter regions: (I) \"flattening the curve\" with little impact on cumulative infections, (II) effectively suppressing transmission, and (III) negligible impact because herd immunity is reached without screening. By evaluating a wide range of scenarios, this work finds broadly that effective mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by unvaccinated-only screening is highly dependent on vaccination rate, population-level immunity, screening compliance, and vaccine effectiveness against the current variant.","journal":"medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences","reference":"Bubar KM, Middleton CE, Bjorkman KK, Parker R, Larremore DB.

In addition, we performed a meta-analysis of antibiotic treatment duration trials, which monitored resistant gram-negative bacteria carriage as an outcome. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for randomised controlled trials published from 1 January 2000 to 4 October 2022, which allocated participants to varying durations of systemic antibiotic treatments. Quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials. The meta-analysis was performed using logistic regression. Duration of antibiotic treatment and time from administration of antibiotics to surveillance culture were included as independent variables. Both the mathematical modelling and meta-analysis suggested modest reductions in resistance carriage could be achieved by reducing antibiotic treatment duration. The models showed that shortening duration is most effective at reducing resistance carriage in high compared to low transmission settings. For treated individuals, shortening duration is most effective when resistant bacteria grow rapidly under antibiotic selection pressure and decline rapidly when stopping treatment. Importantly, under circumstances whereby administered antibiotics can suppress colonising bacteria, shortening antibiotic treatment may increase the carriage of a particular resistance phenotype. We identified 206 randomised trials, which investigated antibiotic duration. Of these, 5 reported resistant gram-negative bacteria carriage as an outcome and were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis determined that a single additional antibiotic treatment day is associated with a 7% absolute increase in risk of resistance carriage (80% credible interval 3% to 11%). Interpretation of these estimates is limited by the low number of antibiotic duration trials that monitored carriage of resistant gram-negative bacteria, as an outcome, contributing to a large credible interval.In this study, we found both theoretical and empirical evidence that reducing antibiotic treatment duration can reduce resistance carriage, though the mechanistic models also highlighted circumstances under which reducing treatment duration can, perversely, increase resistance. Future antibiotic duration trials should monitor antibiotic-resistant bacteria colonisation as an outcome to better inform antibiotic stewardship policies.Reducing antibiotic treatment duration is a key component of hospital antibiotic stewardship interventions. However, its effectiveness in reducing antimicrobial resistance is uncertain and a clear theoretical rationale for the approach is lacking. In this study, we sought to gain a mechanistic understanding of the relation between antibiotic treatment duration and the prevalence of colonisation with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospitalised patients.","journal":"PLoS medicine","reference":"Mo Y, Oonsivilai M, Lim C, Niehus R, Cooper BS.

More than 60-80% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases can be attributed to HBV infection in high HBV prevalent regions. Although traditional Sanger sequencing has been extensively used to investigate HBV sequences, NGS is becoming more commonly used. Further, it is unknown whether word pattern frequencies of HBV reads by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) can be used to investigate HBV genotypes and predict HCC status. In this study, we used NGS to sequence the pre-S region of the HBV sequence of 94 HCC patients and 45 chronic HBV (CHB) infected individuals. Word pattern frequencies among the sequence data of all individuals were calculated and compared using the Manhattan distance. The individuals were grouped using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and hierarchical clustering. Word pattern frequencies were also used to build prediction models for HCC status using both K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM). We showed the extremely high power of analyzing HBV sequences using word patterns. Our key findings include that the first principal coordinate of the PCoA analysis was highly associated with the fraction of genotype B (or C) sequences and the second principal coordinate was significantly associated with the probability of having HCC. Hierarchical clustering first groups the individuals according to their major genotypes followed by their HCC status. Using cross-validation, high area under the receiver operational characteristic curve (AUC) of around 0.88 for KNN and 0.92 for SVM were obtained. In the independent data set of 46 HCC patients and 31 CHB individuals, a good AUC score of 0.77 was obtained using SVM.

Widespread resistance to the non-artemisinin partner drugs in ACTs has the potential to limit the clinical and resistance benefits provided by combination therapy. We aimed to model and evaluate the long-term effects of high levels of partner-drug resistance on the early emergence of artemisinin-resistant genotypes.Higher frequencies of pre-existing partner-drug resistant genotypes lead to earlier establishment of artemisinin resistance. Across all models, a 10-fold increase in the frequency of partner-drug resistance genotypes on average corresponded to loss of artemisinin efficacy 2-12 years earlier. Most reductions in time to artemisinin resistance establishment were observed after an increase in frequency of the partner-drug resistance genotype from 0\u00b70 to 0\u00b710.Partner-drug resistance in ACTs facilitates the early emergence of artemisinin resistance and is a major public health concern. Higher-grade partner-drug resistance has the largest effect, with piperaquine resistance accelerating the early emergence of artemisinin-resistant alleles the most. Continued investment in molecular surveillance of partner-drug resistant genotypes to guide choice of first-line ACT is paramount.Using a consensus modelling approach, we used three individual-based mathematical models of Plasmodium falciparum transmission to evaluate the effects of pre-existing partner-drug resistance and ACT deployment on the evolution of artemisinin resistance. Each model simulates 100\u2009000 individuals in a particular transmission setting (malaria prevalence of 1%, 5%, 10%, or 20%) with a daily time step that updates individuals' infection status, treatment status, immunity, genotype-specific parasite densities, and clinical state. We modelled varying access to antimalarial drugs if febrile (coverage of 20%, 40%, or 60%) with one primary ACT used as first-line therapy: dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ), artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ), or artemether-lumefantrine (AL).

The underlying causes have been the subject of much speculation, with particular attention paid to the shortcomings of the latest generation of vaccines. We formulated transmission models comprising competing hypotheses regarding vaccine failure and challenged them to explain 16 years of highly resolved incidence data from Massachusetts, United States. Our results suggest that the resurgence of pertussis is a predictable consequence of incomplete historical coverage with an imperfect vaccine that confers slowly waning immunity. We found evidence that the vaccine itself is effective at reducing overall transmission, yet that routine vaccination alone would be insufficient for elimination of the disease. Our results indicated that the core transmission group is schoolchildren. Therefore, efforts aimed at curtailing transmission in the population at large, and especially in vulnerable infants, are more likely to succeed if targeted at schoolchildren, rather than adults.","journal":"Science translational medicine","reference":"Domenech de Cell\u00e8s M, Magpantay FMG, King AA, Rohani P.

Seventy-five cases (18%) reported in the administrative database were not captured in the research database, and 35 (9%) cases in the research database were not captured in the administrative database.

Influenza hospitalizations were higher among unvaccinated (32%) than vaccinated (22%) in the current season and among unvaccinated (28%) than vaccinated (23%) in the previous year. The incidence rates for influenza hospitalizations varied by age and season and averaged 421 cases\/100,000 population annually.Accurate population estimates of disease incidence and burden are needed to set appropriate public health policy. The capture-recapture (C-R) method combines data from multiple sources to better estimate prevalence than is possible using single sources.

In-school mitigation efforts varied, depending on local COVID-19 mandates and resources. Using a stochastic age-stratified agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we estimate the impacts of multiple in-school strategies on both infection rates and absenteeism, relative to a baseline scenario in which only symptomatic cases are tested and positive tests trigger a 10-day isolation of the case and 10-day quarantine of their household and classroom. We find that monthly asymptomatic screening coupled with the 10-day isolation and quarantine period is expected to avert 55.4% of infections while increasing absenteeism by 104.3%. Replacing quarantine with test-to-stay would reduce absenteeism by 66.3% (while hardly impacting infection rates), but would require roughly 10-fold more testing resources. Alternatively, vaccination or mask wearing by 50% of the student body is expected to avert 54.1% or 43.1% of infections while decreasing absenteeism by 34.1% or 27.4%, respectively. Separating students into classrooms based on mask usage is expected to reduce infection risks among those who wear masks (by 23.1%), exacerbate risks among those who do not (by 27.8%), but have little impact on overall risk. A combined strategy of monthly screening, household and classroom quarantine, a 50% vaccination rate, and a 50% masking rate (in mixed classrooms) is expected to avert 81.7% of infections while increasing absenteeism by 90.6%.

For example, spatial clustering of highly related parasites can indicate foci of transmission and temporal differences in relatedness can serve as evidence for changes in transmission over time. However, for infections in settings of moderate to high endemicity, understanding patterns of relatedness is compromised by complex infections, overall high forces of infection, and a highly diverse parasite population. It is not clear how much these factors limit the utility of using genomic data to better understand transmission in these settings. In particular, further investigation is required to determine which patterns of relatedness we expect to see with high quality, densely sampled genomic data in a high transmission setting and how these observations change under different study designs, missingness, and biases in sample collection. Here we investigate two identity-by-state measures of relatedness and apply them to amplicon deep sequencing data collected as part of a longitudinal cohort in Western Kenya that has previously been analysed to identify individual-factors associated with sharing parasites with infected mosquitoes. With these data we use permutation tests, to evaluate several hypotheses about spatiotemporal patterns of relatedness compared to a null distribution. We observe evidence of temporal structure, but not of fine-scale spatial structure in the cohort data. To explore factors associated with the lack of spatial structure in these data, we construct a series of simplified simulation scenarios using an agent based model calibrated to entomological, epidemiological and genomic data from this cohort study to investigate whether the lack of spatial structure observed in the cohort could be due to inherent power limitations of this analytical method. We further investigate how our hypothesis testing behaves under different sampling schemes, levels of completely random and systematic missingness, and different transmission intensities.","journal":"Frontiers in epidemiology","reference":"Arambepola R, B\u00e9rub\u00e9 S, Freedman B, Taylor SM, Prudhomme O'Meara W, Obala AA, Wesolowski A.

A major challenge in evaluating future case trends was forecasting the behavior of individuals. When behavior was incorporated into models, it was primarily incorporated exogenously (e.g., fitting to cellphone mobility data). Fewer models incorporated behavior endogenously (e.g., dynamically changing a model parameter throughout the simulation).This review aimed to qualitatively characterize models that included an adaptive (endogenous) behavioral element in the context of COVID-19 transmission. We categorized studies into three approaches: 1) feedback loops, 2) game theory\/utility theory, and 3) information\/opinion spread.While many COVID-19 models incorporated behavior exogenously, these approaches may fail to capture future adaptations in human behavior, resulting in under- or overestimates of disease burden. By incorporating behavior endogenously, the next generation of infectious disease models could more effectively predict outcomes so that decision makers can better prepare for and respond to epidemics.This study was funded in-part by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) MInD-Healthcare Program (1U01CK000536), the National Science Foundation (NSF) Modeling Dynamic Disease-Behavior Feedbacks for Improved Epidemic Prediction and Response grant (2229996), and the NSF PIPP Phase I: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Messaging and Modeling during Pandemics grant (2200256).Of the 92 included studies, 72% employed a feedback loop, 27% used game\/utility theory, and 9% used a model if information\/opinion spread. Among all studies, 89% used a compartmental model alone or in combination with other model types. Similarly, 15% used a network model, 11% used an agent-based model, 7% used a system dynamics model, and 1% used a Markov chain model.

The number of days with optimal temperatures for dengue transmission increased from the period without dengue cases to the period with occurrences of dengue cases. The number of months with optimal transmission temperatures also increased between periods but to a lesser extent.The higher incidence of dengue virus and its expansion to different regions of Argentina seem to be associated with temperature increases in the country during the past two decades. The active surveillance of both the vector and associated arboviruses, together with continued meteorological data collection, will facilitate the assessment and prediction of future epidemics that use trends in the accelerated changes in climate. Such surveillance should go hand in hand with efforts to improve the understanding of the mechanisms driving the geographic expansion of dengue and other arboviruses beyond the current limits. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1289\/EHP11616.We analyzed the evolution of climatological, epidemiological, and biological variables by comparing a period of time without the presence of dengue cases (1976-1997) to a more recent period of time in which dengue cases and important outbreaks occurred (1998-2020). In our analysis, we consider climate variables associated with temperature and precipitation, epidemiological variables such as the number of reported dengue cases and incidence of dengue, and biological variables such as the optimal temperature ranges for transmission of dengue vector.Climate change is an important driver of the increased spread of dengue from tropical and subtropical regions to temperate areas around the world.

The neutropenic diet (ND), which excludes fresh produce, is often utilized to mitigate this risk; however, an analysis weighing the theoretical listeriosis risk reduction of produce exclusion aspects of the ND and possible negative tradeoffs has never been conducted. Consequently, this work constructed decision analytic models using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to compare the impacts of the ND, such as increased neutropenic enterocolitis (NEC) likelihood, with three alternative dietary practices (safe food handling [SFH], surface blanching, and refrigeration only) across five age groups, for cancer patients who consume ready-to-eat salad. Less disruptive diets had fewer negative health impacts in all scenarios, with median alternative diet DALYs per person per chemotherapy cycle having lower values in terms of negative health outcomes (0.088-0.443) than the ND (0.619-3.102). DALYs were dominated by outcomes associated with NEC, which is more common in patients following the ND than in other diets. Switchover point analysis confirmed that, because of this discrepancy, there were no feasible values of other parameters that could justify the ND. Correspondingly, the sensitivity analysis indicated that NEC mortality rate and remaining life expectancy strongly affected DALYs, further illustrating the model's strong dependence on NEC outcomes. Given these findings, and the SFH's ease of implementation and high compliance rates, the SFH diet is recommended in place of the ND.","journal":"Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis","reference":"Gomez CB, Mitchell J, Marks BP.

Counterintuitively, the odds ratio was positively associated with vaccine effectiveness, as a consequence of nonlinear, age-assortative transmission dynamics. Based on the empirical odds ratios (1.33; 95% CI, 1.23-1.43), it was estimated that vaccine effectiveness exceeded 75% in children aged 5 to 9 years and that more than 65% of children remained immune to pertussis 5 years after the last DTaP dose.The United States has experienced a nationwide resurgence of pertussis since the mid-1970s, despite high estimated vaccine coverage. Short-lived immunity induced by diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines in young children is widely believed to be responsible for this growing burden, but the duration of protection conferred by DTaP vaccines remains incompletely quantified.A mathematical, age-structured model of pertussis transmission, previously validated empirically on incidence data in Massachusetts, was used in this simulation study to assess the duration of DTaP immunity most consistent with the empirical values of the relative increase in the odds of acquiring pertussis from recent epidemiologic studies in the United States.

To improve public health preparedness, we sought to predict which existing amino acid mutations in SARS-CoV-2 might contribute to future variants of concern. We tested the predictive value of features comprising epidemiology, evolution, immunology, and neural network-based protein sequence modeling, and identified primary biological drivers of SARS-CoV-2 intra-pandemic evolution. We found evidence that ACE2-mediated transmissibility and resistance to population-level host immunity has waxed and waned as a primary driver of SARS-CoV-2 evolution over time. We retroactively identified with high accuracy (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, AUROC=0.92-0.97) mutations that will spread, at up to four months in advance, across different phases of the pandemic. The behavior of the model was consistent with a plausible causal structure wherein epidemiological covariates combine the effects of diverse and shifting drivers of viral fitness. We applied our model to forecast mutations that will spread in the future and characterize how these mutations affect the binding of therapeutic antibodies. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to forecast the driver mutations that could appear in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. We validate this result against Omicron, showing elevated predictive scores for its component mutations prior to emergence, and rapid score increase across daily forecasts during emergence.

We used Vital Statistics data and growth mixture models to identify clusters of counties by their magnitude of suicide growth from 2008 to 2020 and examined associations with county economic and labor indices. Our models identified five clusters, each differentiated by intercept and slope magnitude, with the highest rate cluster (4% of counties) mainly in sparsely populated areas in the West and Alaska, starting the time series at 25.4 suicides\/100,000, and exhibiting the steepest increase in slope (0.69\/100,000 per year). There was no cluster for which the suicide rate was stable or declining. Counties in the highest rate cluster were more likely to have agriculture and service economies, and less likely to have urban professional economies. Given the increased burden of suicide, with no clusters of counties improving over time, additional policy and prevention efforts are needed, particularly targeted at rural areas in the West.","journal":"American journal of epidemiology","reference":"Keyes KM, Kandula S, Martinez-Ales G, Gimbrone C, Joseph V, Monnat S, Rutherford C, Olfson M, Gould M, Shaman J.

We further calculated the time of peak infectivity and quantified the proportion of secondary infections during the incubation period.ResultsThe median incubation period was 7.2 (95% confidence interval (CI): 6.9\u20127.5) days. The median serial and generation intervals were similar, 4.7 (95% CI: 4.2\u20125.3) and 4.6 (95% CI: 4.2\u20125.1) days, respectively. Paediatric cases\u2009<\u200918 years had a longer incubation period than adult age groups (p\u2009=\u20090.007).

The median time from symptom onset to discharge was also shortened from 18.3 before 22 January to 14.1 days after. Peak infectivity occurred 1 day before symptom onset on average, and the incubation period accounted for 70% of transmission.ConclusionThe high infectivity during the incubation period led to short generation and serial intervals, necessitating aggressive control measures such as early case finding and quarantine of close contacts.","journal":"Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin","reference":"Lu QB, Zhang Y, Liu MJ, Zhang HY, Jalali N, Zhang AR, Li JC, Zhao H, Song QQ, Zhao TS, Zhao J, Liu HY, Du J, Teng AY, Zhou ZW, Zhou SX, Che TL, Wang T, Yang T, Guan XG, Peng XF, Wang YN, Zhang YY, Lv SM, Liu BC, Shi WQ, Zhang XA, Duan XG, Liu W, Yang Y, Fang LQ.

However, if Ae. albopictus proves to be a competent vector of Zika, which does not yet appear to be the case, then there is risk of local establishment in all American regions including Canada and Chile, much of Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, as well as South and East Asia, with a substantial increase in risk to Asia due to the more recent local establishment of Zika in Singapore.The 2015-16 Zika virus pandemic originating in Latin America led to predictions of a catastrophic global spread of the disease. Since the current outbreak began in Brazil in May 2015 local transmission of Zika has been reported in over 60 countries and territories, with over 750 thousand confirmed and suspected cases. As a result of its range expansion attention has focused on possible modes of transmission, of which the arthropod vector-based disease spread cycle involving Aedes species is believed to be the most important. Additional causes of concern are the emerging new links between Zika disease and Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), and a once rare congenital disease, microcephaly.Like dengue and chikungunya, the geographic establishment of Zika is thought to be limited by the occurrence of its principal vector mosquito species, Ae. aegypti and, possibly, Ae. albopictus. While Ae. albopictus populations are more widely established than those of Ae. aegypti, the relative competence of these species as a Zika vector is unknown. The analysis reported here presents a global risk model that considers the role of each vector species independently, and quantifies the potential spreading risk of Zika into new regions. Six scenarios are evaluated which vary in the weight assigned to Ae. albopictus as a possible spreading vector. The scenarios are bounded by the extreme assumptions that spread is driven by air travel and Ae. aegypti presence alone and spread driven equally by both species. For each scenario destination cities at highest risk of Zika outbreaks are prioritized, as are source cities in affected regions. Finally, intercontinental air travel routes that pose the highest risk for Zika spread are also ranked. The results are compared between scenarios.","journal":"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","reference":"Gardner L, Chen N, Sarkar S. (2017).

Recent research provides evidence that self-clearance of Mtb infection may be common, which may affect the potential impact of new vaccines that only take in infected or uninfected individuals. We explored how the inclusion of self-clearance in models of tuberculosis affects the estimates of vaccine impact in China and India.Our work suggests that the neglect of self-clearance in mathematical models of tuberculosis vaccines does not result in substantially biased estimates of tuberculosis vaccine impact. It may, however, mean that we are slightly underestimating the relative advantages of vaccines that work in uninfected individuals only compared to those that work in infected individuals.For both countries, we calibrated a tuberculosis model to a scenario without self-clearance and to various scenarios with self-clearance. To account for the current uncertainty in self-clearance properties, we varied the rate of self-clearance, and the level of protection against reinfection in self-cleared individuals. We introduced potential new vaccines in 2025, exploring vaccines that work in uninfected or infected individuals only, or that are effective regardless of infection status, and modelling scenarios with different levels of vaccine efficacy in self-cleared individuals. We then estimated the relative incidence reduction in 2050 for each vaccine compared to the no vaccination scenario.The inclusion of self-clearance increased the estimated relative reductions in incidence in 2050 for vaccines effective only in uninfected individuals, by a maximum of 12% in China and 8% in India. The inclusion of self-clearance increased the estimated impact of vaccines only effective in infected individuals in some scenarios and decreased it in others, by a maximum of 14% in China and 15% in India. As would be expected, the inclusion of self-clearance had minimal impact on estimated reductions in incidence for vaccines that work regardless of infection status.","journal":"medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences","reference":"Scarponi D, Clark RA, Weerasuriya C, Emery JC, Houben RM, White RG, McCreesh N.

Recent reports of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) indicate that vaccination in prior years may reduce VE in the current season, suggesting vaccine interference. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential effect of repeat influenza vaccinations in the presence of vaccine interference.Even in the presence of potential vaccine interference, our work provides a population-level perspective on the potential merits of repeated influenza vaccination. This is because repeat vaccination groups had lower attack rates than groups that omitted the second vaccination unless vaccine interference was at very high, perhaps implausible, levels.The model shows that, even in the presence of vaccine interference, revaccination reduces the influenza attack rate and provides individual benefits. Specifically, annual vaccination is a favored strategy over vaccination in alternate years, as long as the level of residual protection is less than 58% or vaccine interference effect is minimal. Furthermore, the negative impact of vaccine interference may be offset by increased vaccine coverage levels.Using literature-based parameters, an age-structured influenza equation-based transmission model was used to determine the optimal vaccination strategy, while considering the effect of varying levels of interference.","journal":"Vaccine","reference":"Shim E, Smith KJ, Nowalk MP, Raviotta JM, Brown ST, DePasse J, Zimmerman RK.

Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of group testing designs for individual identification or prevalence estimation of SARS-CoV-2 infection when testing capacity is limited. To do this, we developed mathematical models for epidemic spread, incorporating empirically measured individual-level viral kinetics to simulate changing viral loads in a large population over the course of an epidemic. We used these to construct representative populations and assess pooling strategies for community screening, accounting for variability in viral load samples, dilution effects, changing prevalence and resource constraints. We confirmed our group testing framework through pooled tests on de-identified human nasopharyngeal specimens with viral loads representative of the larger population. We show that group testing designs can both accurately estimate overall prevalence using a small number of measurements and substantially increase the identification rate of infected individuals in resource-limited settings.","journal":"medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences","reference":"Cleary B, Hay JA, Blumenstiel B, Harden M, Cipicchio M, Bezney J, Simonton B, Hong D, Senghore M, Sesay AK, Gabriel S, Regev A, Mina MJ.

Large-scale cholera vaccination campaigns in Haiti would offer the opportunity to synchronise nationwide immunity, providing near-term population protection while improvements to water and sanitation promote long-term cholera elimination.Cholera was introduced into Haiti in 2010. Since then, more than 820\u2008000 cases and nearly 10\u2008000 deaths have been reported. Oral cholera vaccine (OCV) is safe and effective, but has not been seen as a primary tool for cholera elimination due to a limited period of protection and constrained supplies. Regionally, epidemic cholera is contained to the island of Hispaniola, and the lowest numbers of cases since the epidemic began were reported in 2019. Hence, Haiti may represent a unique opportunity to eliminate cholera with OCV.In this modelling study, we assessed the probability of elimination, time to elimination, and percentage of cases averted with OCV campaign scenarios in Haiti through simulations from four modelling teams. For a 10-year period from January 19, 2019, to Jan 13, 2029, we compared a no vaccination scenario with five OCV campaign scenarios that differed in geographical scope, coverage, and rollout duration. Teams used weekly department-level reports of suspected cholera cases from the Haiti Ministry of Public Health and Population to calibrate the models and used common vaccine-related assumptions, but other model features were determined independently.Among campaigns with the same vaccination coverage (70% fully vaccinated), the median probability of elimination after 5 years was 0-18% for no vaccination, 0-33% for 2-year campaigns focused in the two departments with the highest historical incidence, 0-72% for three-department campaigns, and 35-100% for nationwide campaigns. Two-department campaigns averted a median of 12-58% of infections, three-department campaigns averted 29-80% of infections, and national campaigns averted 58-95% of infections. Extending the national campaign to a 5-year rollout (compared to a 2-year rollout), reduced the probability of elimination to 0-95% and the proportion of cases averted to 37-86%.Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Global Good Fund, Institute for Disease Modeling, Swiss National Science Foundation, and US National Institutes of Health.","journal":"The Lancet.

Longer analysis horizon, younger patient age, and longer rechargeable neurostimulator lifetime were associated with increased cost savings. Over a 15-year horizon, adoption of a rechargeable device strategy was projected to save the United States healthcare system up to $12 billion.Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) is a guideline-recommended third-line treatment option for managing overactive bladder. Current SNM devices are not rechargeable, and require neurostimulator replacement every 3-6 years. Our study objective was to assess potential cost effects to payers of adopting a rechargeable SNM neurostimulator device.We constructed a cost-consequence model to estimate the costs of long-term SNM-treatment with a rechargeable versus non-rechargeable device. Costs were considered from the payer perspective at 2015 reimbursement levels. Adverse events, therapy discontinuation, and programming rates were based on the latest published data. Neurostimulator longevity was assumed to be 4.4 and 10.0 years for non-rechargeable and rechargeable devices, respectively. A 15-year horizon was modeled, with costs discounted at 3% per year. Total budget impact to the United States healthcare system was estimated based on the computed per-patient cost findings.At current reimbursement rates, our analysis suggests that rechargeable neurostimulator SNM technology for managing overactive bladder syndrome may deliver significant cost savings to payers over the course of treatment.

A diary-based social contact survey (n = 1768) was conducted in Flanders, Belgium, from September 2010 until February 2011. Many participants touched pets (46%), poultry (2%) or livestock (2%) on a randomly assigned day, and a large proportion of participants owned such animals (51%, 15% and 5%, respectively). Logistic regression models indicated that larger households are more likely to own an animal and, unsurprisingly, that animal owners are more likely to touch animals. We observed a significant effect of age on animal ownership and touching. The total number of social contacts during a randomly assigned day was modeled using weighted-negative binomial regression. Apart from age, household size and day type (weekend versus weekday and regular versus holiday period), animal ownership was positively associated with the total number of social contacts during the weekend. Assuming that animal ownership and\/or touching are at-risk events, we demonstrate a method to estimate the outbreak potential of zoonoses. We show that in Belgium animal-human interactions involving young children (0-9 years) and adults (25-54 years) have the highest potential to cause a major zoonotic outbreak.

Overlap between these communities increased through time in terms of author number, diversity of co-author affiliations, and diversity of citations. However, communities continue to differ in the systems studied, questions asked, and methods employed.

We then used a flexible machine learning approach (gradient boosted machines) to identify the climate and land cover variables associated with the presence of each species.We found significant, regionally specific, positive associations between dog heartworm cases and the abundance of four vector species: Aedes aegypti (Central California), Ae. albopictus (Southern California), Ae. sierrensis (Central California), and Culiseta incidens (Northern and Central California). The proportion of developed land cover was one of the most important ecological variables predicting the presence or absence of the putative vector species.Our results implicate three previously under-recognized vectors of dog heartworm transmission in California and indicate the land cover types in which each putative vector species is commonly found. Efforts to target these species could prioritize surveillance in these land cover types (e.g. near human dwellings in less urbanized settings for Ae. albopictus and Cs. incidens) but further investigation on the natural infection prevalence and host-biting rates of these species, as well as the other local vectors, is needed.Effectively controlling heartworm disease-a major parasitic disease threatening animal health in the US and globally-requires understanding the local ecology of mosquito vectors involved in transmission. However, the key vector species in a given region are often unknown and challenging to identify.

Resulting behavioral changes impacted other infectious diseases including enteropathogens such as norovirus and rotavirus, which had fairly regular seasonal patterns prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The study objective was to project future incidence of norovirus and rotavirus gastroenteritis as contacts resumed and other NPIs are relaxed.We found that the population susceptibility to both viruses increased between March 2020 and November 2021. The 70-90% contact resumption scenarios led to lower incidence than observed pre-pandemic for both viruses. However, we found a greater than two-fold increase in community incidence relative to the pre-pandemic period under the 100% contact scenarios for both viruses. With rotavirus, for which population immunity is driven partially by vaccination, patterns settled into a new steady state quickly in 2022 under the 70-90% scenarios.

This study examines the degree to which the joint effects of air pollution and N-SES on the cognitive decline are mediated by high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure (HBP), and depression. In the Emory Healthy Aging Study, 14,390 participants aged 50+ years from Metro Atlanta, GA, were assessed for subjective cognitive decline using the cognitive function instrument (CFI). Information on the prior diagnosis of high cholesterol, HBP, and depression was collected through the Health History Questionnaire. Participants' census tracts were assigned 3-year average concentrations of 12 air pollutants and 16\u202fN-SES characteristics. We used the unsupervised clustering algorithm Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) to create 6 exposure clusters based on the joint distribution of air pollution and N-SES in each census tract. Linear regression analysis was used to estimate the effects of the SOM cluster indicator on CFI, adjusting for age, race\/ethnicity, education, and neighborhood residential stability. The proportion of the association mediated by high cholesterol levels, HBP, and depression was calculated by comparing the total and direct effects of SOM clusters on CFI. Depression mediated up to 87\u202f% of the association between SOM clusters and CFI. For example, participants living in the high N-SES and high air pollution cluster had CFI scores 0.05 (95\u202f%-CI:0.01,0.09) points higher on average compared to those from the high N-SES and low air pollution cluster; after adjusting for depression, this association was attenuated to 0.01 (95\u202f%-CI:-0.04,0.05).

Fewer analyzed other mortality causes related to chronic alcohol consumption. No studies focused on racism and discrimination, community-level prevention activities, or community social services in relation to alcohol-related mortality. Few studies examined major health policy changes or addressed health care system factors. Although the variation across studies complicates systematic comparison of the results, some key themes did emerge from the reviewed studies, such as the beneficial effects of stronger alcohol policies and the importance of socioeconomic conditions as determinants of alcohol-related mortality. Research using a more diverse set of theoretically informed social determinants may help examine whether, how, and for whom racism and discrimination as well as health policies and social services impact alcohol-related mortality. Finally, there is a gap in research linking local community contexts with alcohol-related mortality. Better understanding of subgroup differences, interactions between different contextual factors, and specific mechanisms of action may help identify promising new strategies to improve population health and reduce alcohol-related mortality.Rates of alcohol-related mortality (including deaths attributed to chronic alcohol use as well as acute causes involving alcohol) have been increasing in the United States, particularly for certain population subgroups, such as women. This review summarizes associations of area-level social determinants of health with alcohol-related mortality. These determinants, measured at the community, county, or state level, include alcohol control policies, health care availability, and a community's socioeconomic environment. Examining multiple geographic levels illuminates how macro-level social determinants and local contexts contribute to alcohol-related mortality to inform intervention. Attention to the broad variety of social determinants of alcohol-related mortality could ultimately improve community health.The authors screened 313 abstracts and excluded 210 that did not meet inclusion criteria.

CWD is a fatal disease that affects wild and farmed cervids in North America with few cases reported overseas. Social interaction of cervids, feeding practices by wildlife keepers and climate effects on the environmental carrying capacity all can affect CWD transmission in deer. Wildlife deer game hunting is economically important to the semi-arid South Texas region and is affected by climate change. In this paper, we model and investigate the effect of climate change on the spread of CWD using typical climate scenarios. We use a system of impulsive differential equations to depict the transmission of CWD between different age groups and gender of cervids. The carrying capacity and contact rates are assumed to depend on climate. Due to the polygamy of bucks, we use mating rates that depend on the number of bucks and does. We analyze the stability of the model and use simulations to study the effect of harvesting (culling) on eradicating the disease, given the climate of South Texas. We use typical climate change scenarios based on published data and our assumptions. For the climate indicator, we calculated and utilized the Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). We found that climate change might hinder the efforts to reduce and effectively manage CWD as it becomes endemic to South Texas. The model shows the extinction of the deer population from this region is a likely outcome.","journal":"Frontiers in epidemiology","reference":"Islam MR, Bulut U, Feria-Arroyo TP, Tyshenko MG, Oraby T.

Three dominant use cases emerged: (i) global maps to identify limits of transmission, estimate burden and assess impacts of future global change, (ii) regional models used to predict the spread of major epidemics between countries and (iii) national and sub-national models that use local datasets to better understand transmission dynamics to improve outbreak detection and response.

While custom-built models can be used to support one-off studies, sustained updates to projections under changing pandemic conditions requires a robust, integrated, and adaptive framework. In this paper, we describe one such framework, UVA-adaptive, that was built to support the CDC-aligned Scenario Modeling Hub (SMH) across multiple rounds, as well as weekly\/biweekly projections to Virginia Department of Health (VDH) and US Department of Defense during the COVID-19 response. Building upon an existing metapopulation framework, PatchSim, UVA-adaptive uses a calibration mechanism relying on adjustable effective transmissibility as a basis for scenario definition while also incorporating real-time datasets on case incidence, seroprevalence, variant characteristics, and vaccine uptake. Through the pandemic, our framework evolved by incorporating available data sources and was extended to capture complexities of multiple strains and heterogeneous immunity of the population.

In order to simulate virus transmission and translocation more realistically, here we expanded this model system to include two migratory bird flocks. We simulated AIV transmission and translocation while varying four core properties: 1) Contact transmission rate; 2) infection recovery rate; 3) infection-induced mortality rate; and 4) migration recovery rate; and three environmental transmission properties: 1) Virion persistence; 2) exposure rate; and 3) re-scaled environmental infectiousness; as well as the time lag in the migration schedule of the two flocks. We found that environmental exposure rate had a significant impact on virus translocation in the two-flock model. Further, certain epidemiological features (i.e., low infection recovery rate, low mortality rate, and high migration transmission rate) in both flocks strongly affected the likelihood of virus translocation.

Indeed, since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, Disease X has been pointed to as the looming threat of \"the next big thing.\" However, developing surveillance and preparedness plans with Disease X as the linchpin is too narrow and ignores a large swath of potential threats from already identified, often neglected diseases. We propose instead the idea of \"Disease f(x)\" as a preferred call to arms with which to prioritize research and programmatic development. The common mathematical notation f(x) represents the knowledge that outbreaks are a function of many variables that define the transmission trajectory of that pathogen. Disease f(x) exploits commonalities across pathogen groupings while recognizing that emergences and outbreaks are fluid and that responses need to be agile and progressively tailored to specific pathogens with cultural and regional context.

Spread to new areas requires connectivity between one or more sources and a suitable local environment, but how these two factors interact at different stages of disease emergence remains largely unknown. Further, no analytical framework exists to examine their roles. Here we develop a dynamic modelling approach for infectious diseases that explicitly models both connectivity via human movement and environmental suitability interactions. We apply it to better understand recently observed (1995-2019) patterns as well as predict past unobserved (1983-2000) and future (2020-2039) spread of dengue in Mexico and Brazil.

Machine learning is a powerful approach for such prediction. One challenge is that some HIV-1 subtypes in currently available training datasets are underrepresented, which likely affects models' generalizability across subtypes. A second challenge is that combinations of bnAbs are required to avoid the inevitable resistance to a single bnAb, and computationally determining optimal combinations of bnAbs is an unsolved problem. Recently, machine learning models trained using resistance outcomes for multiple antibodies at once, a strategy called multi-task learning (MTL), have been shown to improve predictions. We develop a new model and show that, beyond the boost in performance, MTL also helps address the previous two challenges. Specifically, we demonstrate empirically that MTL can mitigate bias from underrepresented subtypes, and that MTL allows the model to learn patterns of co-resistance to combinations of antibodies, thus providing tools to predict antibodies' epitopes and to potentially select optimal bnAb combinations.

To achieve continental elimination of transmission, mapping surveys will need to be conducted across all implementation units (IUs) for which endemicity status is currently unknown. Using boosted regression tree models with optimised hyperparameter selection, we estimated environmental suitability for onchocerciasis at the 5 \u00d7 5-km resolution across Africa. In order to classify IUs that include locations that are environmentally suitable, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to identify an optimal threshold for suitability concordant with locations where onchocerciasis has been previously detected. This threshold value was then used to classify IUs (more suitable or less suitable) based on the location within the IU with the largest mean prediction. Mean estimates of environmental suitability suggest large areas across West and Central Africa, as well as focal areas of East Africa, are suitable for onchocerciasis transmission, consistent with the presence of current control and elimination of transmission efforts. The ROC analysis identified a mean environmental suitability index of 0\u00b771 as a threshold to classify based on the location with the largest mean prediction within the IU. Of the IUs considered for mapping surveys, 50\u00b72% exceed this threshold for suitability in at least one 5 \u00d7 5-km location. The formidable scale of data collection required to map onchocerciasis endemicity across the African continent presents an opportunity to use spatial data to identify areas likely to be suitable for onchocerciasis transmission. National onchocerciasis elimination programmes may wish to consider prioritising these IUs for mapping surveys as human resources, laboratory capacity, and programmatic schedules may constrain survey implementation, and possibly delaying MDA initiation in areas that would ultimately qualify.","journal":"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","reference":"Cromwell EA, Osborne JCP, Unnasch TR, Bas\u00e1\u00f1ez MG, Gass KM, Barbre KA, Hill E, Johnson KB, Donkers KM, Shirude S, Schmidt CA, Adekanmbi V, Adetokunboh OO, Afarideh M, Ahmadpour E, Ahmed MB, Akalu TY, Al-Aly Z, Alanezi FM, Alanzi TM, Alipour V, Andrei CL, Ansari F, Ansha MG, Anvari D, Appiah SCY, Arabloo J, Arnold BF, Ausloos M, Ayanore MA, Baig AA, Banach M, Barac A, B\u00e4rnighausen TW, Bayati M, Bhattacharyya K, Bhutta ZA, Bibi S, Bijani A, Bohlouli S, Bohluli M, Brady OJ, Bragazzi NL, Butt ZA, Carvalho F, Chatterjee S, Chattu VK, Chattu SK, Cormier NM, Dahlawi SMA, Damiani G, Daoud F, Darwesh AM, Daryani A, Deribe K, Dharmaratne SD, Diaz D, Do HT, El Sayed Zaki M, El Tantawi M, Elemineh DA, Faraj A, Fasihi Harandi M, Fatahi Y, Feigin VL, Fernandes E, Foigt NA, Foroutan M, Franklin RC, Gubari MIM, Guido D, Guo Y, Haj-Mirzaian A, Hamagharib Abdullah K, Hamidi S, Herteliu C, Hidru HD, Higazi TB, Hossain N, Hosseinzadeh M, Househ M, Ilesanmi OS, Ilic MD, Ilic IM, Iqbal U, Irvani SSN, Jha RP, Joukar F, Jozwiak JJ, Kabir Z, Kalankesh LR, Kalhor R, Karami Matin B, Karimi SE, Kasaeian A, Kavetskyy T, Kayode GA, Kazemi Karyani A, Kelbore AG, Keramati M, Khalilov R, Khan EA, Khan MNN, Khatab K, Khater MM, Kianipour N, Kibret KT, Kim YJ, Kosen S, Krohn KJ, Kusuma D, La Vecchia C, Lansingh VC, Lee PH, LeGrand KE, Li S, Longbottom J, Magdy Abd El Razek H, Magdy Abd El Razek M, Maleki A, Mamun AA, Manafi A, Manafi N, Mansournia MA, Martins-Melo FR, Mazidi M, McAlinden C, Meharie BG, Mendoza W, Mengesha EW, Mengistu DT, Mereta ST, Mestrovic T, Miller TR, Miri M, Moghadaszadeh M, Mohammadian-Hafshejani A, Mohammadpourhodki R, Mohammed S, Mohammed S, Moradi M, Moradzadeh R, Moraga P, Mosser JF, Naderi M, Nagarajan AJ, Naik G, Negoi I, Nguyen CT, Nguyen HLT, Nguyen TH, Nikbakhsh R, Oancea B, Olagunju TO, Olagunju AT, Omar Bali A, Onwujekwe OE, Pana A, Pourjafar H, Rahim F, Rahman MHU, Rathi P, Rawaf S, Rawaf DL, Rawassizadeh R, Resnikoff S, Reta MA, Rezapour A, Rubagotti E, Rubino S, Sadeghi E, Saghafipour A, Sajadi SM, Samy AM, Sarmiento-Su\u00e1rez R, Sawhney M, Schipp MF, Shaheen AA, Shaikh MA, Shamsizadeh M, Sharafi K, Sheikh A, Shetty BSK, Shin JI, Shivakumar KM, Simonetti B, Singh JA, Skiadaresi E, Soheili A, Soltani S, Spurlock EE, Sufiyan MB, Tabuchi T, Tapak L, Thompson RL, Thomson AJ, Traini E, Tran BX, Ullah I, Ullah S, Uneke CJ, Unnikrishnan B, Uthman OA, Vinkeles Melchers NVS, Violante FS, Wolde HF, Wonde TE, Yamada T, Yaya S, Yazdi-Feyzabadi V, Yip P, Yonemoto N, Yousof HSA, Yu C, Yu Y, Yusefzadeh H, Zaki L, Zaman SB, Zamanian M, Zhang ZJ, Zhang Y, Ziapour A, Hay SI, Pigott DM.

To determine whether the Communities That HEAL (CTH) intervention is effective in increasing naloxone distribution compared with usual care. Methods. The HEALing (Helping to End Addiction Long-Term) Communities Study (HCS) is a cluster-randomized, parallel-arm, wait-list controlled implementation science trial testing the impact of the CTH intervention on increasing the use of evidence-based practices to lower opioid-related overdose deaths. Communities (n\u2009=\u200967) highly impacted by opioid overdose in Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio were allocated to CTH intervention (n\u2009=\u200934) or wait-list comparison (usual care; n\u2009=\u200933) arms. The primary outcome for this study was the number of naloxone units distributed in HCS communities during the comparison period (July 1, 2021\u2012June 30, 2022), examined using an intent-to-treat negative binomial regression model. Results. Naloxone distribution was 79% higher in the CTH intervention versus usual care arm (adjusted relative rate\u2009=\u20091.79; 95% confidence interval\u2009=\u20091.28, 2.51; P\u2009=\u2009.001; adjusted rates of naloxone distribution 3378 vs 1884 naloxone units per 100\u2009000 residents), when controlling for urban\u2012rural status, state, baseline opioid-related overdose death rate, and baseline naloxone distribution rate.

We allow for varying waning efficacy of vaccine-induced immunity, as this has not yet been measured. We account for the fact that known COVID-positive cases may not have been included in the first round of vaccination. And, we account for age-specific immune patterns in both states at the time of the start of the vaccination program. Our analysis assumes that health systems during winter 2020-2021 had equal staffing and capacity to previous phases of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic; we do not consider the effects of understaffed hospitals or unvaccinated medical staff.Assuming high vaccination coverage (>28%) and no major changes in distancing, masking, gathering size, hygiene guidelines, and virus transmissibility between 1 January 2021 and 1 July 2021 a combination of vaccination and population immunity may lead to low or near-zero transmission levels by the second quarter of 2021.We find that allocating a substantial proportion (>75%) of vaccine supply to individuals over the age of 70 is optimal in terms of reducing total cumulative deaths through mid-2021. This result is robust to different profiles of waning vaccine efficacy and several different assumptions on age mixing during and after lockdown periods. As we do not explicitly model other high-mortality groups, our results on vaccine allocation apply to all groups at high risk of mortality if infected. A median of 327 to 340 deaths can be avoided in Rhode Island (3444 to 3647 in Massachusetts) by optimizing vaccine allocation and vaccinating the elderly first. The vaccination campaigns are expected to save a median of 639 to 664 lives in Rhode Island and 6278 to 6618 lives in Massachusetts in the first half of 2021 when compared to a scenario with no vaccine. A policy of vaccinating only seronegative individuals avoids redundancy in vaccine use on individuals that may already be immune, and would result in 0.5% to 1% reductions in cumulative hospitalizations and deaths by mid-2021.When three SARS-CoV-2 vaccines came to market in Europe and North America in the winter of 2020-2021, distribution networks were in a race against a major epidemiological wave of SARS-CoV-2 that began in autumn 2020. Rapid and optimized vaccine allocation was critical during this time. With 95% efficacy reported for two of the vaccines, near-term public health needs likely require that distribution is prioritized to the elderly, health care workers, teachers, essential workers, and individuals with comorbidities putting them at risk of severe clinical progression.","journal":"BMC medicine","reference":"Tran TN, Wikle NB, Albert E, Inam H, Strong E, Brinda K, Leighow SM, Yang F, Hossain S, Pritchard JR, Chan P, Hanage WP, Hanks EM, Boni MF.

The IE performs well for the YoV methods, providing a time-efficient mechanism for updates to impact estimates.Deaths due to vaccine preventable diseases cause a notable proportion of mortality worldwide. To quantify the importance of vaccination, it is necessary to estimate the burden averted through vaccination. The Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium (VIMC) was established to estimate the health impact of vaccination.We describe the methods implemented by the VIMC to estimate impact by calendar year, birth year and year of vaccination (YoV). The calendar and birth year methods estimate impact in a particular year and over the lifetime of a particular birth cohort, respectively. The YoV method estimates the impact of a particular year's vaccination activities through the use of impact ratios which have no stratification and stratification by activity type and\/or birth cohort. Furthermore, we detail an impact extrapolation (IE) method for use between coverage scenarios. We compare the methods, focusing on YoV for hepatitis B, measles and yellow fever.These methods provide a robust set of approaches to quantify vaccination impact; however it is vital that the area of impact estimation continues to develop in order to capture the full effect of immunisation.","journal":"BMC public health","reference":"Echeverria-Londono S, Li X, Toor J, de Villiers MJ, Nayagam S, Hallett TB, Abbas K, Jit M, Klepac P, Jean K, Garske T, Ferguson NM, Gaythorpe KAM.

How RVFV spreads through a population depends on population-level and individual-level interactions between vector, host and pathogen. Here, we estimated the probability for RVFV to transmit to naive animals by experimentally exposing lambs to a bite of an infectious mosquito, and assessed if and how RVFV infection subsequently developed in the exposed animal. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, previously infected via feeding on a viremic lamb, were used to expose naive lambs to the virus. Aedes aegypti colony mosquitoes were used as they are easy to maintain and readily feed in captivity. Other mosquito spp. could be examined with similar methodology. Lambs were exposed to either 1-3 (low exposure) or 7-9 (high exposure) infectious mosquitoes. All lambs in the high exposure group became viremic and showed characteristic signs of Rift Valley fever within 2-4 days post exposure. In contrast, 3 out of 12 lambs in the low exposure group developed viremia and disease, with similar peak-levels of viremia as the high exposure group but with some heterogeneity in the onset of viremia. These results suggest that the likelihood for successful infection of a ruminant host is affected by the number of infectious mosquitoes biting, but also highlights that a single bite of an infectious mosquito can result in disease. The per bite mosquito-to-host transmission efficiency was estimated at 28% (95% confidence interval: 15 - 47%). We subsequently combined this transmission efficiency with estimates for life traits of Aedes aegypti or related mosquitoes into a Ross-McDonald mathematical model to illustrate scenarios under which major RVFV outbreaks could occur in na\u00efve populations (i.e., R0 >1). The model revealed that relatively high vector-to-host ratios as well as mosquitoes feeding preferably on competent hosts are required for R0 to exceed 1. Altogether, this study highlights the importance of experiments that mimic natural exposure to RVFV. The experiments facilitate a better understanding of the natural progression of disease and a direct way to obtain epidemiological parameters for mathematical models.","journal":"Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology","reference":"Bron GM, Wichgers Schreur PJ, de Jong MCM, van Keulen L, Vloet RPM, Koenraadt CJM, Kortekaas J, Ten Bosch QA.

This has important implications for the epidemiology of TB. We conducted this first countrywide cross-sectional study to identify the prevalent M. tuberculosis lineages and to assess their epidemiological associations and their relation to drug resistance. The study was conducted among isolates acquired in reference hospitals across Vietnam. Isolates with drug susceptibility testing profiles were identified for their lineages by spoligotyping. Logistic regression was used to investigate the association of M. tuberculosis lineages with location, age and sex of the patients and drug resistance levels.Results showed that the most prevalent lineage was Beijing (55.4\u00a0%), followed by EAI (27.5\u00a0%), T (6.4\u00a0%), LAM (1.3\u00a0%), Haarlem (1\u00a0%) and Zero type (0.3\u00a0%).

Overall, Beijing isolates were the most likely to be drug-resistant and EAI isolates were the least likely to be drug-resistant, except in the South of Vietnam where EAI is also highly drug-resistant. The proportion of Beijing isolates was significantly higher (p\u2009<\u20090.01), and the proportion of EAI isolates was significantly lower (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in younger patients.

At least one transmission route was detected for 65.7% of clusters. During the same time, traditional IP investigation prompted WGS for 15 suspected outbreaks involving 133 patients, for which transmission events were identified for 5 (3.8%). If EDS-HAT had been running in real-time, 25-63 transmissions could have been prevented. EDS-HAT was found to be cost-saving and more effective than traditional IP practice, with overall savings of $192,408 - $692,532.We performed WGS surveillance of healthcare-associated bacterial pathogens from November 2016 to November 2018. EHR ML was used to identify the transmission routes for WGS-detected outbreaks, which were investigated by an IP expert. Potential infections prevented were estimated and compared to traditional IP practice during the same period.EDS-HAT detected multiple outbreaks not identified using traditional IP methods, correctly identified the transmission routes for most outbreaks, and would save the hospital substantial costs. Traditional IP practice misidentified outbreaks for which transmission did not occur.

Yet, open questions remain, both experimentally and theoretically. Some of the fundamental properties predicted by models still need to be addressed experimentally. We contribute to this by using a combination of experiments and theory to investigate the role of migration in mutant distribution. In the case of neutral mutants, while the mean frequency of mutants is not influenced by migration, the probability distribution is. To address this empirically, we performed in vitro experiments, where mixtures of GFP-labelled (\"mutant\") and non-labelled (\"wid-type\") murine cells were grown in wells (demes), and migration was mimicked via cell transfer from well to well. In the presence of migration, we observed a change in the skewedness of the distribution of the mutant frequencies in the wells, consistent with previous and our own model predictions. In the presence of de novo mutant production, we used modelling to investigate the level at which disadvantageous mutants are predicted to exist, which has implications for the adaptive potential of the population in case of an environmental change. In panmictic populations, disadvantageous mutants can persist around a steady state, determined by the rate of mutant production and the selective disadvantage (selection-mutation balance). In a fragmented system that consists of demes connected by migration, a steady-state persistence of disadvantageous mutants is also observed, which, however, is fundamentally different from the mutation-selection balance and characterized by higher mutant levels. The increase in mutant frequencies above the selection-mutation balance can be maintained in small ( N<Nc ) demes as long as the migration rate is sufficiently small. The migration rate above which the mutants approach the selection-mutation balance decays exponentially with N\/Nc . The observed increase in the mutant numbers is not explained by the change in the effective population size. Implications for evolutionary processes in diseases are discussed, where the pre-existence of disadvantageous drug-resistant mutant cells or pathogens drives the response of the disease to treatments.","journal":"Journal of evolutionary biology","reference":"Kreger J, Brown D, Komarova NL, Wodarz D, Pritchard J.

The median age at onset for all patients with RV-GE increased from 11 months during the 2007 season to 15 months during the 2015 season, and the onset, peak, and cessation of incidence were delayed. When citywide vaccination coverage in the prior 12 months was classified into high and low groups (\u22658.36% vs <8.36%), the incidence rate ratio for the high coverage group decreased by 32.4% among children younger than 4 years (incidence rate ratio, 0.676; 95% CI, 0.659-0.693; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Among the children ineligible for vaccination, the incidence rate ratio in higher coverage periods was 0.790 (95% CI, 0.351-0.915; P\u2009<\u2009.001) compared with the lower coverage. Compared with districts with 14% or less vaccination coverage, the adjusted odds ratio for RV-GE among unvaccinated children younger than 3 years was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.73-0.99; P\u2009=\u2009.03) for districts with 15% to 19% of coverage, and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.67-0.93; P\u2009=\u2009.004) for districts with more than 20% of coverage.","journal":"JAMA network open","reference":"Fu C, Dong Z, Shen J, Yang Z, Liao Y, Hu W, Pei S, Shaman J.

It is caused by a bacterial infection that leads to the inflammation of the air sacs in human lungs and potentially results in a lung abscess if not properly untreated. Here in this article we introduced a novel mathematical model to investigate the potential impact of Pneumonia treatments on disease transmission dynamics. The model is then validated against data from Jakarta City, Indonesia. In the model, the infection stage in infected individuals is categorized into three stages: the Exposed, Congestion and Hepatization, and the Resolution stage. Mathematical analysis shows that the disease-free equilibrium is always locally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction number is less than one and unstable when larger than one. The endemic equilibrium only exists when the basic reproduction number is larger than one. Our proposed model always exhibits a forward bifurcation when the basic reproduction number is equal to one, which indicates local stability of the endemic equilibrium when the basic reproduction number is larger than one but close to one. A global sensitivity analysis shows that the infection parameter is the most influential parameter in determining the size of the total infected individual in the endemic equilibrium point. Furthermore, we also found that the hospitalization and the acceleration of the treatment duration can be used to control the level of endemic size. An optimal control problem was constructed from the earlier model and analyzed using the Pontryagin Maximum Principle. We find that the implementation of treatment in the earlier stage of infected individuals is needed to avoid a more significant outbreak of Pneumonia in a long-term intervention.","journal":"Heliyon","reference":"Aldila D, Awdinda N, Fatmawati, Herdicho FF, Ndii MZ, Chukwu CW.

In the casual partnership network, the mean path was highest in the youngest age group and lowest in the oldest age group, despite the fact that the youngest group had the lowest mean momentary degree and past-year partner counts.We used temporal exponential random graph models to estimate the generative parameters for each city's dynamic sexual network from survey data.

Cross-sectional connectivity is a function of network features like momentary degree and assortative mixing. Temporal connectivity is driven by partner acquisition rates.

In an ED with rMRI for brain availability, we considered additional strategies: universal rMRI, universal rMRI with CT, PIBIS with rMRI, and PIBIS with rMRI followed by CT .

One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Main outcomes evaluated in this study were AHT correctly identified and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year.By applying CT to a more targeted population, PIBIS decreases radiation exposure and is more effective for AHT identification compared with clinical judgment. When rMRI is available, universal rMRI with CT is more effective than PIBIS and is economically favorable.Without rMRI availability, PIBIS followed by CT was the most cost-effective strategy. Results were sensitive to variation of CT-induced cancer parameters and AHT prevalence.

Evidence for biotic interactions, however, can be obscured by shared environmental requirements, posing a challenge for statistical inference. Here, we introduce a dynamic statistical model, based on probit regression, that quantifies the effects of spatial and temporal covariance in longitudinal co-occurrence data. We separate the fixed pairwise effects of species occurrences on persistence and colonization rates, a potential signal of direct interactions, from latent pairwise correlations in occurrence, a potential signal of shared environmental responses. We first validate our modeling framework with several simulation studies. Then, we apply the approach to a pressing epidemiological question by examining how human papillomavirus (HPV) types coexist. Our results suggest that while HPV types respond similarly to common host traits, direct interactions are sparse and weak, so that HPV type diversity depends largely on shared environmental drivers. Our modeling approach is widely applicable to microbial communities and provides valuable insights that should lead to more directed hypothesis testing and mechanistic modeling.","journal":"The ISME journal","reference":"Ranjeva SL, Mihaljevic JR, Joseph MB, Giuliano AR, Dwyer G.

Significant risk factors for in-hospital mortality included age\u2009\u2265\u200945\u00a0years (A), confusion on admission (C), HIV-infection (H), and serum blood urea nitrogen >7\u00a0mmol\/L (U), which were used to create the seven-point ACHU clinical predictor score. In-hospital mortality, stratified by ACHU score was: score \u22641, 2.4%, score 2, 6.4%, score 3, 11.9%, and score\u2009\u2265\u20094, 29.3%.

Most maps rely on cross-sectional surveys of parasite prevalence, but health facilities represent an underused and powerful data source. We aimed to model and map malaria incidence using health facility data in Uganda.Using 24 months (2019-2020) of individual-level outpatient data collected from 74 surveillance health facilities located in 41 districts across Uganda (n=445\u2009648 laboratory-confirmed cases), we estimated monthly malaria incidence for parishes within facility catchment areas (n=310) by estimating care-seeking population denominators. We fit spatio-temporal models to the incidence estimates to predict incidence rates for the rest of Uganda, informed by environmental, sociodemographic and intervention variables. We mapped estimated malaria incidence and its uncertainty at the parish level and compared estimates to other metrics of malaria. To quantify the impact that indoor residual spraying (IRS) may have had, we modelled counterfactual scenarios of malaria incidence in the absence of IRS.Over 4567 parish-months, malaria incidence averaged 705 cases per 1000 person-years. Maps indicated high burden in the north and northeast of Uganda, with lower incidence in the districts receiving IRS. District-level estimates of cases correlated with cases reported by the Ministry of Health (Spearman's r=0.68, p<0.0001), but were considerably higher (40 166 418 cases estimated compared with 27 707 794 cases reported), indicating the potential for underreporting by the routine surveillance system. Modelling of counterfactual scenarios suggest that approximately 6.2\u2009million cases were averted due to IRS across the study period in the 14 districts receiving IRS (estimated population 8 381 223).Outpatient information routinely collected by health systems can be a valuable source of data for mapping malaria burden.

Serological surveys, which provide direct measures of population protection against the infection, are underexploited and often supply fragmentary estimates of population immunity. This study aims to investigate how measles immunity has changed over time across different socioeconomic settings, as a result of demographic changes and past immunisation policies.Our model shows that estimated residual susceptibility to measles ranges from 3% in the UK to more than 10% in Kenya and Ethiopia. In high-income countries, such as Italy, Singapore, and South Korea, where routine first-dose administration produced more than 90% of immunised individuals, only about 20% of susceptible individuals are younger than 5 years. We also observed that the reduction in fertility that has occurred during the past decades in high-income countries has contributed to almost half of the reduction in measles incidence. In low-income countries, where fertility is high, the population is younger and routine vaccination has been suboptimum. Susceptible individuals are concentrated in early childhood, with about 60% of susceptible individuals in Ethiopia younger than 10 years. In these countries, Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) were responsible for more than 25% of immunised individuals (up to 45% in Ethiopia), mitigating the consequences of suboptimum routine vaccination coverage.For this multi-country modelling analysis, we developed a transmission model to simulate measles circulation during the past 65 years in nine countries with distinct demographic and vaccination histories. The model was calibrated on historical serological data and used to estimate the reduction of disease burden as a result of vaccination and present age-specific residual susceptibility.Future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunisation rates, either by raising first-dose coverage or by making erratic SIAs more frequent and regular. Immunisation campaigns targeting adolescents and adults are required in low-fertility countries, where the susceptibility in these age groups will otherwise sustain measles circulation.European Research Council.","journal":"The Lancet.

Such expansion could improve patients' health, protect background MDR TB drugs, and decrease transmission, but would likely result in greater resistance to bedaquiline.We created a Markov decision model to follow a hypothetical cohort of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB patients under different bedaquiline use strategies. The explored strategies included making bedaquiline available to all patients with MDR TB, restricting bedaquiline usage to patients with MDR plus additional resistance and withholding bedaquiline introduction completely. We compared these strategies according to life expectancy, risks of acquired resistance, and the expected number and health outcomes of secondary cases. For our simulated cohort, the mean (2.5th, 97.5th percentile) life expectancy from time of initiation of MDR TB treatment at age 30 was 36.0 y (33.5, 38.7) assuming all patients with MDR TB received bedaquiline, 35.1 y (34.4, 35.8) assuming patients with pre-extensively drug-resistant (PreXDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB received bedaquiline, and 34.9 y (34.6, 35.2) assuming only patients with XDR TB received bedaquiline. Although providing bedaquiline to all MDR patients resulted in the highest life expectancy for our initial cohort averaged across all parameter sets, for parameter sets in which bedaquiline conferred high risks of added mortality and only small reductions in median time to culture conversion, the optimal strategy would be to withhold use even from patients with the most extensive resistance. Across all parameter sets, the most liberal bedaquiline use strategies consistently increased the risk of bedaquiline resistance but decreased the risk of resistance to other MDR drugs. In almost all cases, more liberal bedaquiline use strategies reduced the expected number of secondary cases and resulting life years lost. The generalizability of our results is limited by the lack of available data about drug effects among individuals with HIV co-infection, drug interactions, and other sources of heterogeneity, as well as changing recommendations for MDR TB treatment.New drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) are becoming available for the first time in over 40 y.

As countries affected by the 2013-2015 epidemic in West Africa, by far the largest to date, are declared free of Ebola virus disease (EVD), it remains unclear what threat is posed by rare sexual transmission events that could arise from survivors.We devised a compartmental mathematical model that includes sexual transmission from convalescent survivors: a SEICR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-convalescent-recovered) transmission model. We fitted the model to weekly incidence of EVD cases from the 2014-2015 epidemic in Sierra Leone. Sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations showed that a 0.1% per sex act transmission probability and a 3-month convalescent period (the two key unknown parameters of sexual transmission) create very few additional cases, but would extend the epidemic by 83 days [95% CI: 68-98 days] (p < 0.0001) on average. Strikingly, a 6-month convalescent period extended the average epidemic by 540 days (95% CI: 508-572 days), doubling the current length, despite an insignificant rise in the number of new cases generated.Our results show that reductions in the per sex act transmission probability via abstinence and condom use should reduce the number of sporadic sexual transmission events, but will not significantly reduce the epidemic size and may only minimally shorten the length of time the public health community must maintain response preparedness. While the number of infectious survivors is expected to greatly decline over the coming months, our results show that transmission events may still be expected for quite some time as each event results in a new potential cluster of non-sexual transmission. Precise measurement of the convalescent period is thus important for planning ongoing surveillance efforts.","journal":"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","reference":"Abbate JL, Murall CL, Richner H, Althaus CL.

Accurate forecasts of influenza and influenza-like illness (ILI) have been named by the CDC as an important tool to fight the damaging effects of these epidemics. Multi-model ensembles make accurate forecasts of seasonal influenza, but current operational ensemble forecasts are static: they require an abundance of past ILI data and assign fixed weights to component models at the beginning of a season, but do not update weights as new data on component model performance is collected. We propose an adaptive ensemble that (i) does not initially need data to combine forecasts and (ii) finds optimal weights which are updated week-by-week throughout the influenza season. We take a regularized likelihood approach and investigate this regularizer's ability to impact adaptive ensemble performance. After finding an optimal regularization value, we compare our adaptive ensemble to an equal-weighted and static ensemble. Applied to forecasts of short-term ILI incidence at the regional and national level, our adaptive model outperforms an equal-weighted ensemble and has similar performance to the static ensemble using only a fraction of the data available to the static ensemble. Needing no data at the beginning of an epidemic, an adaptive ensemble can quickly train and forecast an outbreak, providing a practical tool to public health officials looking for a forecast to conform to unique features of a specific season.","journal":"Statistics in medicine","reference":"McAndrew T, Reich NG.

Estimates from contact tracing data are prone to potential biases due to the increased likelihood of detecting large clusters of cases, and may reflect variation in contact behavior more than biological heterogeneity. In contrast, the average number of secondary infections per contact is routinely estimated from household surveys, and these studies can minimize biases by testing all members of a household. However, the models used to analyze household transmission data typically assume that infectiousness and susceptibility are the same for all individuals or vary only with predetermined traits such as age. Here we develop and apply a combined forward simulation and inference method to quantify the degree of inter-individual variation in both infectiousness and susceptibility from observations of the distribution of infections in household surveys. First, analyzing simulated data, we show our method can reliably ascertain the presence, type, and amount of these heterogeneities given data from a sufficiently large sample of households. We then analyze a collection of household studies of COVID-19 from diverse settings around the world, and find strong evidence for large heterogeneity in both the infectiousness and susceptibility of individuals. Our results also provide a framework to improve the design of studies to evaluate household interventions in the presence of realistic heterogeneity between individuals.","journal":"Epidemics","reference":"Anderson TL, Nande A, Merenstein C, Raynor B, Oommen A, Kelly BJ, Levy MZ, Hill AL.

Although this scenario is uncommon, there have been multiple outbreaks that occur in small infection clusters in Asia with relatively lowtransmissibility, and thus are too weak to cause an epidemic. Still, subcritical transmission from stut-tering chain data is vital for determining whether avian influenza is close to the threshold of \u211c\u2080 > 1.In this article, we will explore two methods of estimating \u211c\u2080 using transmission chains and parameterestimation through data fitting. We found that \u211c\u2080 = 0.2205 when calculating the \u211c\u2080 using the maxi-mum likelihood method. When we computed the reproduction number for human to human transmis-sion through differential equations and fitted the model to data from the cumulative cases, cumulativedeaths, and cumulative secondary cases, we estimated \u211c\u2080 = 0.1768. To avoid violating the assumptionof the least square method, we fitted the model to incidence data to obtain \u211c\u2080 = 0.1520. We tested thestructural and practical identifiability of the model, and concluded that the model is identifiable undercertain assumptions. We further use two more methods to estimate \u211c\u2080 : by the \u211c\u2080 definition whichgives an overestimate of 0.28 and by Ferguson approach which yields \u211c\u2080 = 0.1586.

Five scenarios were modeled: (1) plasma only (status quo); (2) plasma at high-volume sites, DBS at low-volume sites; (3) plasma at high-volume sites, PSC at low-volume sites; (4) PSC only; (5) DBS only.Scenario 1 resulted in 795 342 correct results due to limited patient access. When allowing for full and partial adoption of dried specimens, access increases by 19%, with scenario 3 producing the greatest number of correct results expected (929 857). The average cost per correct VL result was lowest in the plasma + DBS scenario at $30.90 compared to $31.62 in our plasma + PSC scenario. The cost per correct result of using dried specimens only was dominated in the incremental analysis, due primarily to fewer correct results.Routine plasma viral load (VL) testing is recommended for monitoring human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy. In Zambia, VL scale-up is limited due to logistical obstacles around plasma specimen collection, storage, and transport to centralized laboratories. Dried blood spots (DBSs) could circumvent many logistical challenges at the cost of increased misclassification. Recently, plasma separation cards (PSCs) have become available and, though more expensive, have lower total misclassification than DBSs.Adopting the partial use of dried specimens will help achieve improved VL access for patients at the lowest cost per correct result.","journal":"Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America","reference":"Nichols BE, Girdwood SJ, Shibemba A, Sikota S, Gill CJ, Mwananyanda L, Noble L, Stewart-Isherwood L, Scott L, Carmona S, Rosen S, Stevens W.

For example, the literature on neighborhood determinants of health continues to grow. Likewise, community randomized trials are applied to learn about real-world implementation, sustainability, and population effects of interventions with proven individual-level efficacy. In these settings, individual-level outcomes are correlated due to shared cluster-level factors, including the exposure, as well as social or biological interactions between individuals. To flexibly and efficiently estimate the effect of a cluster-level exposure, we present two targeted maximum likelihood estimators (TMLEs). The first TMLE is developed under a non-parametric causal model, which allows for arbitrary interactions between individuals within a cluster. These interactions include direct transmission of the outcome (i.e. contagion) and influence of one individual's covariates on another's outcome (i.e. covariate interference). The second TMLE is developed under a causal sub-model assuming the cluster-level and individual-specific covariates are sufficient to control for confounding. Simulations compare the alternative estimators and illustrate the potential gains from pairing individual-level risk factors and outcomes during estimation, while avoiding unwarranted assumptions. Our results suggest that estimation under the sub-model can result in bias and misleading inference in an observational setting. Incorporating working assumptions during estimation is more robust than assuming they hold in the underlying causal model. We illustrate our approach with an application to HIV prevention and treatment.","journal":"Statistical methods in medical research","reference":"Balzer LB, Zheng W, van der Laan MJ, Petersen ML.

Characterizing heterogeneity in contact patterns across individuals, time, and space is necessary to inform accurate estimates of transmission risk, particularly to explain superspreading, predict age differences in vulnerability, and inform social distancing policies. Current respiratory disease models often rely on data from the 2008 POLYMOD study conducted in Europe, which is now outdated and potentially unrepresentative of behavior in the US. We seek to understand the variation in contact patterns across spatial scales and demographic and social classifications, whether there is seasonality to contact patterns, and what social behavior looks like at baseline in the absence of an ongoing pandemic.We analyze spatiotemporal non-household contact patterns across 11 million survey responses from June 2020 - April 2021 post-stratified on age and gender to correct for sample representation. To characterize spatiotemporal heterogeneity in respiratory contact patterns at the county-week scale, we use generalized additive models. In the absence of pre-pandemic data on contact in the US, we also use a regression approach to produce baseline contact estimates to fill this gap.Although contact patterns varied over time during the pandemic, contact is relatively stable after controlling for disease. We find that the mean number of non-household contacts is spatially heterogeneous regardless of disease. There is additional heterogeneity across age, gender, race\/ethnicity, and contact setting, with mean contact decreasing with age and lower in women. The contacts of white individuals and contacts at work or social events change the most under increased national incidence.We develop the first county-level estimates of non-pandemic contact rates for the US that can fill critical gaps in parameterizing disease models.

However, commonly used models are often highly simplified representations of incredibly complex systems. Because of these simplifications, the model output, of, say, new cases of a disease over time or when an epidemic will occur, may be inconsistent with the available data. In this case, we must improve the model, especially if we plan to make decisions based on it that could affect human health and safety, but direct improvements are often beyond our reach. In this work, we explore this problem through a case study of the Zika outbreak in Brazil in 2016. We propose an embedded discrepancy operator\u2014a modification to the model equations that requires modest information about the system and is calibrated by all relevant data. We show that the new enriched model demonstrates greatly increased consistency with real data. Moreover, the method is general enough to easily apply to many other mathematical models in epidemiology.\r\nPotential epidemics of communicable diseases are a major health concern of the modern world, especially as city density, air and water pollution, and worldwide travel steadily increase. A stark example of this is the global coronavirus outbreak, already responsible for more than 2000 deaths around the world at the time of this article\u2019s submission and more than 13\u2009000 at the time of revision, approximately one month later. When faced with a potential outbreak, decision-makers such as health officials and medical professionals rely on mathematical models to aid their decision-making processes. However, oftentimes, these models are not consistent with the dynamical system they are designed to represent. The discrepancy between the output of a model and the real system is then a serious impediment, as it may decrease our confidence in the model, or even invalidate it entirely, so that it can no longer be used to aid in decision-making. When such a discrepancy is observed, we, as modelers, must either improve the model or somehow account for the discrepancy itself. While a direct model improvement is usually the most desirable solution, how to do so may be infeasible because of computational reasons, time constraints, or lack of domain knowledge. This paper provides a systematic method to instead account for the discrepancy itself, explored via a case study of the Brazilian Zika epidemic of 2016. The method is not a correction of the model output to data, but rather a modification of the model equations themselves by a so-called embedded discrepancy operator. The operator is designed with three critical properties in mind: interpretability, domain-consistency, and robustness. We show that including the embedded discrepancy operator greatly increases the fidelity of the model so that the model output and real data are now in fact consistent.","journal":"Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science","reference":"Rebecca Morrison, Americo Cunha Jr..

This study investigates the feasibility of using social media, primarily Twitter, to monitor illness outbreaks such as avian flu. Using temporal, geographical, and correlation analyses, we investigated the association between avian influenza tweets and officially verified cases in the United Kingdom in 2021 and 2022. Pearson correlation coefficient, bivariate Moran's I analysis and time series analysis, were among the methodologies used. The findings show a weak, statistically insignificant relationship between the number of tweets and confirmed cases in a temporal context, implying that relying simply on social media data for surveillance may be insufficient. The spatial analysis provided insights into the overlaps between confirmed cases and tweet locations, shedding light on regionally targeted interventions during outbreaks. Although social media can be useful for understanding public sentiment and concerns during outbreaks, it must be combined with traditional surveillance methods and official data sources for a more accurate and comprehensive approach. Improved data mining techniques and real-time analysis can improve outbreak detection and response even further.

Further, only two modelling studies had potential utility for real-time decision support, and only one model was validated using real data.Anthrax is a potential biological weapon and can be used in an air-borne or mail attack, such as in the attack in the United States in 2001. Planning for such an event requires the best available science. Since large-scale experiments are not feasible, mathematical modelling is a crucial tool to inform planning. The aim of this study is to systematically review and evaluate the approaches to mathematical modelling of inhalational anthrax attack to support public health decision making and response.A systematic review of inhalational anthrax attack models was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. The models were reviewed based on a set of defined criteria, including the inclusion of atmospheric dispersion component and capacity for real-time decision support.The limited modelling studies available use widely varying methods, assumptions, and data. Estimation of attack size using different models may be quite different, and is likely to be under-estimated by models which do not consider weather conditions. Validation with available data is crucial and may improve models. Further, there is a need for both complex models that can provide accurate atmospheric dispersion modelling, as well as for simpler modelling tools that provide real-time decision support for epidemic response.","journal":"Prehospital and disaster medicine","reference":"Chen X, Bahl P, de Silva C, Heslop D, Doolan C, Lim S, MacIntyre CR.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and, particularly, multidrug resistance (MDR) among Salmonella enterica poses a risk to human health. Antimicrobial use (AMU) regulations in livestock have been implemented to reduce AMR and MDR in foodborne pathogens. In this study, we used an integrated machine learning approach to investigate Salmonella AMR and MDR patterns before and after the implementation of AMU restrictions in agriculture in the United States. For this purpose, Salmonella isolates from cattle in the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) dataset were analysed using three descriptive models consisting of hierarchical clustering, network analysis, and association rule mining. The analysis showed the impact of the United States' 2012 extra-label cephalosporin regulations on AMR trends and revealed a distinctive MDR pattern in the Dublin serotype. The results also indicated that each descriptive model provides insights on a specific aspect of resistance patterns and, therefore, combining these approaches make it possible to gain a deeper understanding of AMR.","journal":"Preventive veterinary medicine","reference":"Mosaddegh A, Angel CC, Craig M, Cummings KJ, Cazer CL.

Few empirical data are available regarding the temporal correlation between depression symptoms and suicidal ideation. We investigated the anecdotal concern that suicidal ideation may increase during a period of depression improvement.Longitudinal Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 is a questionnaire of 9 multiple-choice questions to assess the frequency of depressive symptoms within the previous two weeks. We analyzed a chronic depression treatment population's electronic health record (EHR) data, containing 610 patients' longitudinal PHQ-9 scores (62% age 45 and older; 68% female) within 40 weeks.The irregular and sparse EHR data were transformed into continuous trajectories using Gaussian process regression. We first estimated the correlations between the symptoms (total score of the first 8 questions; PHQ-8) and suicide ideation (9th question score; Item 9) using the cross-correlation function. We then used an artificial neural network (ANN) to discover subtypes of depression patterns from the fitted depression trajectories. In addition, we conducted a separate analysis using the unfitted raw PHQ scores to examine PHQ-8's and Item 9's pattern changes.Results showed that the majority of patients' PHQ-8 and Item 9 scores displayed strong temporal correlations. We found five patterns in the PHQ-8 and the Item 9 trajectories. We also found 8% - 13% of the patients have experienced an increase in suicidal ideation during the improvement of their PHQ-8. Using a trajectory-based method for subtype pattern detection in depression progression, we provided a better understanding of temporal correlations between depression symptoms over time.","journal":"PloS one","reference":"Gong J, Simon GE, Liu S.

In particular, military-relevant large-scale studies of daily heat stress morbidity responses among physically active, working-age adults to various indices of heat have been limited. We evaluated daily means, maximums, minimums, and early morning measures of temperature, heat index, and wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) indices, assessing their association with 31,642 case-definition heat stroke and heat exhaustion encounters among active duty servicemembers diagnosed at 24 continental US installations from 1998 to 2019. We utilized anonymized encounter data consisting of hospitalizations, ambulatory (out-patient) visits, and reportable events to define heat stress illness cases and select the 24 installations with the highest case counts. We derived daily indices of heat from hourly-scale gridded climate data and applied a case-crossover study design incorporating distributed-lag, nonlinear models with 5\u00a0days of lag to estimate odds ratios at one-degree increments for each index of heat. All indices exhibited nonlinear odds ratios with short-term lag effects throughout observed temperature ranges. Responses were positive, monotonic, and exponential in nature, except for maximum daily WBGT, minimum daily temperature, temperature at 0600\u00a0h (local), and WBGT at 0600\u00a0h (local), which, while generally increasing, showed decreasing risk for the highest heat category days. The risk for a heat stress illness on a day with a maximum WBGT of 32.2\u00a0\u00b0C (90.0 \u00b0F) was 1.93 (95% CI, 1.82 - 2.05) times greater than on a day with a maximum WBGT of 28.6\u00a0\u00b0C (83.4 \u00b0F). The risk was 2.53 (2.36-2.71) times greater on days with a maximum heat index of 40.6\u00a0\u00b0C (105 \u00b0F) compared to 32.8\u00a0\u00b0C (91.0 \u00b0F).

In this paper, we give an overview of the epidemiological and genetic features characterising the spread and evolution of WNV L2 in Italy, leveraging data obtained from national surveillance activities between 2011 and 2021, including 46 newly assembled genomes that were analysed under both phylogeographic and phylodynamic frameworks. In addition, to better understand the seasonal patterns of the virus, we used a machine learning model predicting areas at high-risk of WNV spread. Our results show a progressive increase in WNV L2 in Italy, clarifying the dynamics of interregional circulation, with no significant introductions from other countries in recent years. Moreover, the predicting model identified the presence of suitable conditions for the 2022 earlier and wider spread of WNV in Italy, underlining the importance of using quantitative models for early warning detection of WNV outbreaks.

A dynamic programming framework enables an assessment of the marginal value of information and determines the optimal policy, including when and how much information to collect.We prove that it may be optimal to delay information collection until a time when the information more immediately affects decision making. For the example of HCV screening, given initial beliefs, the optimal policy (at 2010) was to continue screening and collect information about the distribution of liver fibrosis at screen-detected diagnosis in 12 years, increasing the expected incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) by $169.5 million compared to current guidelines.The cost-effectiveness and value of additional information about a health technology or program may change over time because of trends affecting patient cohorts and\/or the intervention.

Inspecting the results of individual countries shows how consecutive observed waves can differ greatly with respect to the case fatality ratio. Furthermore, in large countries, a more detailed analysis shows that consecutive observed waves have different geographical ranges. We also show how waves can be modulated by government interventions and find that early implementation of NPIs correlates with a reduced number of observed waves and reduced mortality burden in those waves.A discussion of 'waves' of the COVID-19 epidemic in different countries is a part of the national conversation for many, but there is no hard and fast means of delineating these waves in the available data and their connection to waves in the sense of mathematical epidemiology is only tenuous.We present an algorithm which processes a general time series to identify substantial, significant and sustained periods of increase in the value of the time series, which could reasonably be described as 'observed waves'. This provides an objective means of describing observed waves in time series.

Weights are obtained from the proportion of participating labs over all labs. We adjust these weights for attractiveness and density of labs over population. The market share of sentinel labs, as estimated by the econometric Huff-model, is also considered. Additionally, we investigate the effect of not recognizing sentinel labs as sentinel labs when they report no cases. We estimate the bias associated with the different weights as the difference between the simulated number of cases and the estimate of this total from the sentinel sample. As motivating data examples, we apply an extended Huff-model to four pathogens under laboratory sentinel surveillance in Belgium between 2010 and 2015 and discuss the model fit. We estimate the total number of lab-confirmed cases associated with Rotavirus, influenza virus, Y. enterocolitica and Campylobacter spp.. The extended Huff-model takes the lab-concept, the number of reimbursements and the number of departments, lab-density, regional borders, distance and competition between labs in account.Inverse probability weighting (IPW) methods can be used to estimate the total number of cases from the sample collected through sentinel surveillance. Central to these methods are the inverse weights which can be derived in several ways and, in this case, represent the probability that laboratory (lab) sentinel surveillance detects a lab-confirmed case.Estimates obtained with the Huff-model were most accurate in the more complex simulation scenarios as compared to other weights. In the data examples, several significant coefficients are identified, but the fit of the Huff-model to the Belgian sentinel surveillance data leaves much variability in market shares unexplained.The Huff-model allows for estimation of the spatial and population coverage of sentinel surveillance and through IPW-methods also for the estimation of the total number of cases.

In this study, we aim to examine the associated risk factors for COVID-19 infection among HCWs in North-East Nigeria. We used data collected retrospectively among a cohort of clinical and non-clinical HCWs in six healthcare facilities in Adamawa State, Nigeria. We estimated the marginal probability of COVID-19 infection among HWCs using alternating logistic regression via the generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach. Among the 318 HCWs, 178 (55.97%) were males, mean (\u00b1SD) age was 36.81 (\u00b18.98), 237 (74.76%) were clinical, and 80 (25.24) were non-clinical staff. The overall prevalence of COVID-19 was 16.67% among HCWs. After adjusting for other variables in the model, our results showed that clinical staff had a 5-fold higher risk of COVID-19 infection than non-clinical staff (aOR = 5.07, 95% CI: 1.32-19.52). Moreover, significant exposure risk factors for COVID-19 infection for HCWs increase with age, time spent attending to patients, caring for COVID-19 patients, and having worked with COVID-19 samples, while the risk decreases with the use of an N95 mask. Our findings suggested that the burden of COVID-19 infection is higher for clinical staff than non-clinical staff, and increasing age contributed to the increased risk.","journal":"Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)","reference":"Stephen RI, Olumoh J, Tyndall J, Adegboye O.

For 2015\/16, frequentist and Bayesian VE estimates were essentially identical (41% each). For 2017\/18, frequentist and Bayesian estimates of VE against A(H3N2) viruses were also nearly identical (26% vs. 23%, respectively), even though the presence of apparent antigenic match could potentially have pulled Bayesian estimates upward. Precision of estimates was similar between methods in both seasons. Frequentist and Bayesian estimates diverged for children in 2013\/14. Under the frequentist approach, LAIV effectiveness was 62 percentage points lower than IIV, while LAIV was only 27 percentage points lower than IIV under the Bayesian approach.Routine influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) surveillance networks use frequentist methods to estimate VE. With data from more than a decade of VE surveillance from diverse global populations now available, using Bayesian methods to explicitly account for this knowledge may be beneficial. This study explores differences between Bayesian vs. frequentist inference in multiple seasons with varying VE.We used data from the United States Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (US Flu VE) Network. Ambulatory care patients with acute respiratory illness were enrolled during seasons of varying observed VE based on traditional frequentist methods. We estimated VE against A(H1N1)pdm in 2015\/16, dominated by A(H1N1)pdm; against A(H3N2) in 2017\/18, dominated by A(H3N2); and compared VE for live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) vs. inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) among children aged 2-17\u2009years in 2013\/14, also dominated by A(H1N1)pdm. VE was estimated using both frequentist and Bayesian methods using the test-negative design. For the Bayesian estimates, prior VE distributions were based on data from all published test-negative studies of the same influenza type\/subtype available prior to the season of interest.Bayesian estimates of influenza VE can differ from frequentist estimates to a clinically meaningful degree when VE diverges substantially from previous seasons.","journal":"BMC public health","reference":"Jackson ML, Ferdinands J, Nowalk MP, Zimmerman RK, Kieke B, Gaglani M, Murthy K, Petrie JG, Martin ET, Chung JR, Flannery B, Jackson LA.

Applying modern analytical tools such as machine learning to increasingly high dimensional data offers the potential to expand our perspectives on these processes, shedding new light on complex ecological phenomena such as pathogen transmission in wild populations. Here, we propose a novel approach that combines data mining with theoretical models of disease dynamics. Using rodents as an example, we incorporate statistical differences in the life history features of zoonotic reservoir hosts into pathogen transmission models, enabling us to bound the range of dynamical phenomena associated with hosts, based on their traits. We then test for associations between equilibrium prevalence, a key epidemiological metric and data on human outbreaks of rodent-borne zoonoses, identifying matches between empirical evidence and theoretical predictions of transmission dynamics. We show how this framework can be generalized to other systems through a rubric of disease models and parameters that can be derived from empirical data.

However, risk metrics have not reliably predicted key outcomes and have often lacked transparency in terms of prioritization of false-positive versus false-negative signals. They have also struggled to maintain relevance over time due to slow and infrequent updates addressing new variants and shifts in vaccine- and infection-induced immunity. We make two contributions to address these weaknesses. We first present a framework to evaluate predictive accuracy based on policy targets related to severe disease and mortality, allowing for explicit preferences toward false-negative versus false-positive signals. This approach allows policymakers to optimize metrics for specific preferences and interventions. Second, we propose a method to update risk thresholds in real time. We show that this adaptive approach to designating areas as \"high risk\" improves performance over static metrics in predicting 3-wk-ahead mortality and intensive care usage at both state and county levels. We also demonstrate that with our approach, using only new hospital admissions to predict 3-wk-ahead mortality and intensive care usage has performed consistently as well as metrics that also include cases and inpatient bed usage. Our results highlight that a key challenge for COVID-19 risk prediction is the changing relationship between indicators and outcomes of policy interest. Adaptive metrics therefore have a unique advantage in a rapidly evolving pandemic context.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","reference":"Bilinski AM, Salomon JA, Hatfield LA.

We categorized hemodialysis patients in Japan into new clusters generated by the K-means clustering method using the development dataset. The association between a cluster and the risk of death was evaluated using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. Then, we developed an ensemble model composed of the clusters and support vector machine models in the model development phase, and compared the accuracy of the prediction of mortality between the machine learning models in the model validation phase.Average age of the subjects was 65.7\u00b112.2 years; 32.7% had diabetes mellitus.

However, the optimal treatment strategy for the individual may not be optimal for the population and vice versa. To determine when the two-level optimal controls are in accord or conflict, we develop a multi-scale model using various functions that link the viral load within host and the transmission rate between hosts, calibrated by cohort data. We obtain the within-host optimal treatment scheme that minimizes the viral load and maximizes the count of healthy cells at the individual level, and the coupled optimal scheme that minimizes the basic reproduction number at the population level. Mathematical analysis shows that whether the two-level optimal controls coincide depends on the sign of the product of their switching functions. Numerical results suggest that they are in accord for a high maximal drug efficacy but may conflict for a low drug efficacy. Using the multi-scale model, we also identify a threshold of the treatment effectiveness that determines how early treatment initiation can affect the disease dynamics among population. These results may help develop a synergistic treatment protocol beneficial to both HIV-infected individuals and the whole population.","journal":"Mathematical biosciences","reference":"Shen M, Xiao Y, Rong L, Meyers LA.

Additionally, multivariate logistic regression analysis (MVLRA) was used to analyse factors that influence the use of bed nets. Finally, covariance compared the mean calibrated hole indexes (MCHI) across potential influence variables.The bed net to person ratio was 1:1.96 (i.e., more than one net for every two people).

Data analysis employed statistical trends, correlation and regression, principal component analysis, and predictive models.Several studies focus on the impacts of social media and related platforms on spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories.

The principal components analysis identifies two latent variables comprising past coronavirus epidemics (pastCoVepidemics) and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (presCoVpandemic). Both principal components (PCs) were utilized significantly to learn about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and explained 88.78% variability. (ii). Three (3) PCs fuelled misinformation about COVID-19 [Misinformation(\"Biological Weapon,\" \"VirusHoax,\" \"CommonCold,\" \"COVID-19Hoax,\" \"ChinaVirus\"); ConspTheory1(\"@5G\"); ConspTheory1(\"IngestBleach\")]. These PCs explained 84.85% of the variability, (iii). Two (2) PCs identified two components of public health measures [PubHealthMes1(\"Social Distancing,\" \"WashHand,\" \"Isolation,\" \"Quarantine.\"); PubHealthMes2(\"WearMask\"), which explained 84.7% of the variability.

Investigation into the predictability of 30-day readmissions can lead to clinical decision support tools and targeted interventions that can help care providers to improve individual patient care and reduce readmission risk.Dynamically predicting readmission and quantifying trends over patients' hospital stay illuminated differing risk trajectory groups. Identifying risk trajectory patterns and distinguishing predictors may shed new light on indicators of readmission and the isolated effects of the index hospitalization.A two-stage predictive modeling approach combining logistic and beta regression was applied to electronic health record data accumulated daily to predict 30-day readmission for 534 hospital encounters of patients with heart failure over 2750 patient days. Unsupervised clustering was performed on predictions to uncover time-dependent trends in readmission risk over the patient's hospital stay. We used data collected between September 1, 2013, and August 31, 2015, from a community hospital in Maryland (United States) for patients with a primary diagnosis of heart failure. Patients who died during the hospital stay or were transferred to other acute care hospitals or hospice care were excluded.Readmission occurred in 107 (107\/534, 20.0%) encounters. The out-of-sample area under curve for the 2-stage predictive model was 0.73 (SD 0.08). Dynamic clinical predictors capturing laboratory results and vital signs had the highest predictive value compared with demographic, administrative, medical, and procedural data included. Unsupervised clustering identified four risk trajectory groups: decreasing risk (131\/534, 24.5% encounters), high risk (113\/534, 21.2%), moderate risk (177\/534, 33.1%), and low risk (113\/534, 21.2%). The decreasing risk group demonstrated change in average probability of readmission from admission (0.69) to discharge (0.30), whereas the high risk (0.75), moderate risk (0.61), and low risk (0.39) groups maintained consistency over the hospital course. A higher level of hemoglobin, larger decrease in potassium and diastolic blood pressure from admission to discharge, and smaller number of past hospitalizations are associated with decreasing readmission risk (P<.001).","journal":"JMIR medical informatics","reference":"Jiang W, Siddiqui S, Barnes S, Barouch LA, Korley F, Martinez DA, Toerper M, Cabral S, Hamrock E, Levin S.

While these predictions provide generic insights into improving control, the most effective strategy in any situation depends on the specific epidemiology in the region and the associated costs.Intervention strategies that included vector control are predicted to halt transmission most quickly. Targeted active screening, with better and more focused coverage, and enhanced passive surveillance, with improved access to diagnosis and treatment, are both estimated to avert many new infections but, when used alone, are unlikely to halt transmission before 2030 in high-risk settings.","journal":"Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America","reference":"Rock KS, Ndeffo-Mbah ML, Casta\u00f1o S, Palmer C, Pandey A, Atkins KE, Ndung'u JM, Hollingsworth TD, Galvani A, Bever C, Chitnis N, Keeling MJ.

Interacting with the extracellular matrix through focal adhesion complexes, stress fibers are highly dynamic structures regulated by\u00a0myosin motors and crosslinking proteins. Under external mechanical stimuli such as tensile forces, the stress fiber remodels its architecture to adapt to external cues, displaying properties of viscoelastic materials. How the structural remodeling of stress fibers is related to the generation of contractile force is not well understood. In this work, we simulate mechanochemical dynamics and force generation of stress fibers using the molecular simulation platform MEDYAN. We model stress fiber as two connecting bipolar bundles attached at the ends to focal adhesion complexes. The simulated stress fibers generate contractile force that is regulated by myosin motors and [Formula: see text]-actinin crosslinkers. We find that stress fibers enhance contractility by reducing the distance between actin filaments to increase crosslinker binding, and this structural remodeling ability depends on the crosslinker turnover rate. Under tensile pulling force, the stress fiber shows an instantaneous increase of the contractile forces followed by a slow relaxation into a new steady state. While the new steady state contractility after pulling depends only on the overlap between actin bundles, the short-term contractility enhancement is sensitive to the tensile pulling distance. We further show that this mechanical response is also sensitive to the crosslinker turnover rate. Our results provide new insights into the stress fiber mechanics that have significant implications for understanding cellular adaptation to mechanical signaling.","journal":"Scientific reports","reference":"Ni H, Ni Q, Papoian GA, Trache A, Jiang Y.

The number of identified cases in Wuhan has increased rapidly since, and cases have been identified in other Chinese cities and other countries (as of 23 January 2020). We fitted a transmission model to reported case information up to 21 January to estimate key epidemiological measures, and to predict the possible course of the epidemic, as the potential impact of travel restrictions into and from Wuhan. We estimate the basic reproduction number of the infection (R_0) to be 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 3.6-4.0), indicating that 72-75% of transmissions must be prevented by control measures for infections to stop increasing. We estimate that only 5.1% (95%CI, 4.8-5.5) of infections in Wuhan are identified, and by 21 January a total of 11,341 people (prediction interval, 9,217-14,245) had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. Should the epidemic continue unabated in Wuhan, we predict the epidemic in Wuhan will be substantially larger by 4 February (191,529 infections; prediction interval, 132,751-273,649), infection will be established in other Chinese cities, and importations to other countries will be more frequent. Our model suggests that travel restrictions from and to Wuhan city are unlikely to be effective in halting transmission across China; with a 99% effective reduction in travel, the size of the epidemic outside of Wuhan may only be reduced by 24.9% on 4 February. Our findings are critically dependent on the assumptions underpinning our model, and the timing and reporting of confirmed cases, and there is considerable uncertainty associated with the outbreak at this early stage. With these caveats in mind, our work suggests that a basic reproductive number for this 2019-nCoV outbreak is higher compared to other emergent coronaviruses, suggesting that containment or control of this pathogen may be substantially more difficult.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementJMR acknowledges support from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EP\/N014499\/1) and the Medical Research Council (MR\/S004793\/1).

Models also suggest that elimination can always be achieved if enough people are treated often enough with an effective enough drug. Other models supported the idea that targeting ages at highest risk or continued improvements in hygiene and sanitation can contribute meaningfully to trachoma control.

Accurately characterizing the burden is challenging because of nonspecific symptoms and limited diagnostics. Prior seroepidemiology studies have struggled to find consensus cutoffs that permit comparisons of estimates across contexts and time. In this study, we present a novel approach that does not require a cutoff and instead uses information about antibody kinetics after infection to estimate seroincidence. We use data from three cohorts of scrub typhus patients in Chiang Rai, Thailand, and Vellore, India, to characterize antibody kinetics after infection and two population serosurveys in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, and Tamil Nadu, India, to estimate seroincidence. The samples were tested for IgM and IgG responses to Orientia tsutsugamushi-derived recombinant 56-kDa antigen using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to characterize antibody responses after scrub typhus infection and used the joint distributions of the peak antibody titers and decay rates to estimate population-level incidence rates in the cross-sectional serosurveys. Median responses persisted above an optical density (OD) of 1.8 for 23.6 months for IgG and an OD of 1 for 4.5 months for IgM. Among 18- to 29-year-olds, the seroincidence was 10 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI, 5-19) in Tamil Nadu, India, and 14 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI: 10-20) in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. When seroincidence was calculated with antibody decay ignored, the disease burden was underestimated by more than 50%. The approach can be deployed prospectively, coupled with existing serosurveys, or leverage banked samples to efficiently generate scrub typhus seroincidence estimates.","journal":"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","reference":"Aiemjoy K, Katuwal N, Vaidya K, Shrestha S, Thapa M, Teunis P, Bogoch II, Trowbridge P, Blacksell SD, Paris DH, Wangrangsimakul T, Varghese GM, Maude RJ, Tamrakar D, Andrews JR.

However, neither the optimal pathway nor the corresponding economic and health benefits have been evaluated. We take China as an example to assess the optimal pathway towards elimination and the cost-effectiveness of tailored actions.A validated hybrid model was used to assess the costs and benefits of alternative strategies combining human papillomavirus vaccination, cervical screening, and treatment of pre-invasive lesions and invasive cancer for females with different immunization history. All Chinese females living or projected to be born during 2015-2100, under projected trends in aging, urbanization, and sexual activity, were considered. Optimal strategies were determined by cost-effectiveness efficiency frontiers. Primary outcomes were cervical cancer cases and deaths averted and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We employed a lifetime horizon from a societal perspective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses evaluate model uncertainty.The optimal pathway represents an integration of multiple tailored strategies from females with different immunization history. If China adopts the optimal pathway, the age-standardized incidence of cervical cancer is predicted to decrease to fewer than four new cases per 100,000 women (i.e., elimination) by 2047 (95% confidence interval 2043 to 2050).

The use of evidence-based algorithms may improve decentralized, rapid treatment-initiation, reducing the global burden of childhood mortality.We analyzed data from a prospective cohort of children <13 years being routinely evaluated for pulmonary tuberculosis in Cape Town, South Africa from March 2012 to November 2017. We developed a regression model to describe the contributions of baseline clinical evaluation to the diagnosis of tuberculosis using standardized, retrospective case definitions. We included results from baseline chest radiography and Xpert MTB\/RIF to the model to develop an algorithm with at least 90% sensitivity in predicting tuberculosis.Limitations in the sensitivity and accessibility of diagnostic tools for childhood tuberculosis contribute to the substantial gap between estimated cases and cases notified to national tuberculosis programs. Thus, tools to make accurate and rapid clinical diagnoses are necessary to initiate more children on antituberculosis treatment.Data from 478 children being evaluated for pulmonary tuberculosis were analyzed (median age: 16.2 months, interquartile range: 9.8-30.9); 242 (50.6%) were retrospectively classified with tuberculosis, of which 104 (43.0%) were bacteriologically-confirmed.

We generated pseudo-birth data from the observed seasonal patterns of birth in the United States and analyzed them in relation to observed temperatures using design-specific seasonality adjustments.Most designs can be implemented in a way that yields estimates unbiased by conception seasonality. The time-stratified case-crossover design exhibited a small positive bias, which could contribute to, but not fully explain, previously reported associations.Using the case-crossover approach (time-stratified by calendar month), we observed a bias (among 1,000 replicates) = 0.016 (Monte-Carlo standard error 95% CI: 0.015-0.018) in the regression coefficient for every 10\u00b0C increase in mean temperature in the warm season (May-September). Unbiased estimates obtained using the time-series approach required accounting for both the pregnancies-at-risk and their weighted probability of birth. Notably, adding the daily weighted probability of birth from the time-series models to the case-crossover models corrected the bias in the case-crossover approach. In the pair-matched case-control design, where the exposure period was matched on gestational window, we observed no bias. The time-to-event approach was also unbiased but was more computationally intensive than others.Seasonal patterns of conception may confound acute associations between birth outcomes and seasonally varying exposures.

Using serosurveillance and postmortem surveillance, we constructed multiplicative factors estimating ratios of true infections to reported cases in Africa since March 2020.The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on global health, the magnitude of which appears to differ intercontinentally: for example, reports suggest 271,900 per million people have been infected in Europe versus 8,800 per million people in Africa. While Africa is the second largest continent by population, its reported COVID-19 cases comprise <3% of global cases. Although social, environmental, and environmental explanations have been proposed to clarify this discrepancy, systematic infection underascertainment may be equally responsible.Multiplicative factors derived from serology data (subset of 12 nations) suggested a range of COVID-19 reporting rates, from 1 in 2 infections reported in Cape Verde (July 2020) to 1 in 3,795 infections reported in Malawi (June 2020). A similar set of multiplicative factors for all nations derived from postmortem data points toward the same conclusion: reported COVID-19 cases are unrepresentative of true infections, suggesting a key reason for low case burden in many African nations is significant underdetection and underreporting.While estimating COVID-19's exact burden is challenging, the multiplicative factors we present furnish incidence estimates reflecting likely-to-worst-case ranges of infection.

These channels likely contribute to depolarizing the DSM cell membrane, leading to bladder overactivity. Our research focuses on understanding TRPM4 channel function in the DSM cells of mice, using computational modeling. We aimed to create a detailed computational model of the TRPM4 channel based on existing electrophysiological data. We employed a modified Hodgkin-Huxley model with an incorporated TRP-like current to simulate action potential firing in response to current and synaptic stimulus inputs.

Vaccination plays a crucial role in disease control by preventing a substantial number of cases and associated disabilities. However, vaccine hesitancy poses a barrier that hinders these efforts. Our article presents a novel approach by proposing a mathematical model for COVID-19 that incorporates vaccine hesitancy, vaccine efficacy and behaviour compensation post-vaccination. The model is calibrated with COVID-19 incidence data for India from 13 February 2021 to 12 January 2022, using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The analysis examines the effects of hesitancy and social interventions through a series of practical simulations. The simulation results show that while COVID-19-infected individuals may have natural immunity, vaccination post-recovery is crucial to reduce cases by up to 64.1%. Social interventions, such as face masks and distancing, remain essential to prevent a rise in cases and ensure effective disease control. The model demonstrates that vaccination, combined with continued social interventions, is crucial for effectively reducing COVID-19 cases and preventing future outbreaks. Addressing vaccine hesitancy and maintaining preventive measures are key to successfully controlling the pandemic.","journal":"Royal Society open science","reference":"Tanwar K, Kumawat N, Tripathi JP, Chauhan S, Mubayi A.

Herpesviruses establish life-long latent infections within neurons, which may reactivate into lytic infections due to stress or immune suppression. There are nine human herpesviruses (HHV) posing health concerns from benign conditions to life threatening encephalitis, including cancers associated with viral infections. The current treatment options for most HHV conditions mainly include several nucleoside and nucleotide analogs targeting viral DNA polymerase. Although these drugs help manage infections, their common mechanism of action may lead to the development of drug resistance, which is particularly devastating in immunocompromised patients. Therefore, new classes of drugs directed against novel targets in HHVs are necessary to alleviate this issue. We analyzed the conservation rates of all proteins in herpes simplex virus 1 (HHV-1), a representative of the HHV family and one of the most common viruses infecting the human population. Furthermore, we generated a full-length structure model of the most conserved HHV-1 protein, the DNA packaging terminase pUL15. A series of computational analyses were performed on the model to identify ATP and DNA binding sites and characterize the dynamics of the protein. Our study indicates that proteins involved in HHV-1 DNA packaging and cleavage are amongst the most conserved gene products of HHVs. Since the packaging protein pUL15 is the most conserved among all HHV-1 gene products, the virus will have a lower chance of developing resistance to small molecules targeting pUL15. A subsequent analysis of the structure of pUL15 revealed distinct ATP and DNA binding domains and the elastic network model identifies a functionally important hinge region between the two domains of pUL15. The atomic information on the active and allosteric sites in the ATP- and DNA-bound model of pUL15 presented in this study can inform the structure-based drug discovery of a new class of drugs to treat a wide range of HHVs.","journal":"Biomolecules","reference":"Thaljeh LF, Rothschild JA, Naderi M, Coghill LM, Brown JM, Brylinski M.

However, viruses of microbes can also initiate chronic infections, in which new viruses particles are released via budding and without cell lysis. In chronic infections, viral genomes may also be passed on from mother to daughter cells during division. The consequences of chronic infections for the population dynamics of viruses and microbes remains under-explored. In this paper we present a model of chronic infections as well as a model of interactions between lytic and chronic viruses competing for the same microbial population. In the chronic only model, we identify conditions underlying complex bifurcations such as saddle-node, backward and Hopfbifurcations, leading to parameter regions with multiple attractors and\/or oscillatory behavior. We then utilize invasion analysis to examine the coupled nonlinear system of microbes, lytic viruses, and chronic viruses. In so doing we find unexpected results, including a regime in which the chronic virus requires the lytic virus for survival, invasion, and persistence. In this regime, lytic viruses decrease total cell densities, so that a subpopulation of chronically infected cells experience decreased niche competition. As such, even when chronically infected cells have a growth disadvantage, lytic viruses can, paradoxically, enable the proliferation of both chronically infected cells and chronic viruses. We discuss the implications of our results for understanding the ecology and long-term evolution of heterogeneous viral strategies.","journal":"Journal of theoretical biology","reference":"Gulbudak H, Weitz JS.

The accuracy of model simulations and predictions invariably depends on the specification of model parameters. Estimation of these parameters is therefore extremely important; however, while some parameters can be derived from observational studies, the values of others are difficult to measure. Instead, models can be coupled with inference algorithms (i.e., data assimilation methods, or statistical filters), which fit model simulations to existing observations and estimate unobserved model state variables and parameters. Ideally, these inference algorithms should find the best fitting solution for a given model and set of observations; however, as those estimated quantities are unobserved, it is typically uncertain whether the correct parameters have been identified. Further, it is unclear what 'correct' really means for abstract parameters defined based on specific model forms. In this work, we explored the problem of non-identifiability in a stochastic system which, when overlooked, can significantly impede model prediction. We used a network, agent-based model to simulate the transmission of Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) within hospital settings and attempted to infer key model parameters using the Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter, an efficient Bayesian inference algorithm. We show that even though the inference method converged and that simulations using the estimated parameters produced an agreement with observations, the true parameters are not fully identifiable. While the model-inference system can exclude a substantial area of parameter space that is unlikely to contain the true parameters, the estimated parameter range still included multiple parameter combinations that can fit observations equally well. We show that analyzing synthetic trajectories can support or contradict claims of identifiability. While we perform this on a specific model system, this approach can be generalized for a variety of stochastic representations of partially observable systems. We also suggest data manipulations intended to improve identifiability that might be applicable in many systems of interest.","journal":"PloS one","reference":"Robin TT, Cascante-Vega J, Shaman J, Pei S.

Unlike most previous models, this framework considers the behavioral states and state transitions of adult mosquitoes through a sequence of activity bouts. We developed a new framework for individual-based simulation models called MBITES (Mosquito Bout-based and Individual-based Transmission Ecology Simulator). In MBITES, it is possible to build models that simulate the behavior and ecology of adult mosquitoes in exquisite detail on complex resource landscapes generated by spatial point processes. We also developed an ordinary differential equation model which is the Kolmogorov forward equations for models developed in MBITES under a specific set of simplifying assumptions. While mosquito infection and pathogen development are one possible part of a mosquito's state, that is not our main focus. Using extensive simulation using some models developed in MBITES, we show that vectorial capacity can be understood as an emergent property of simple behavioral algorithms interacting with complex resource landscapes, and that relative density or sparsity of resources and the need to search can have profound consequences for mosquito populations' capacity to transmit pathogens.","journal":"PLoS computational biology","reference":"Wu SL, S\u00e1nchez C HM, Henry JM, Citron DT, Zhang Q, Compton K, Liang B, Verma A, Cummings DAT, Le Menach A, Scott TW, Wilson AL, Lindsay SW, Moyes CL, Hancock PA, Russell TL, Burkot TR, Marshall JM, Kiware S, Reiner RC Jr., Smith DL.

These results suggest that this methodology is a valid way to study the self-treatment behavior of a web-based community of people who use opioids. Our Withdrawal Remedy Explorer application provides a platform for using these data for pharmacovigilance, the identification of new treatments, and the better understanding of the needs of people undergoing opioid withdrawal. Furthermore, this approach could be applied to many other disease states for which people self-manage their symptoms and discuss their experiences on the web.The cessation of opioid use can cause withdrawal symptoms. People often continue opioid misuse to avoid these symptoms. Many people who use opioids self-treat withdrawal symptoms with a range of substances. Little is known about the substances that people use or their effects.The aim of this study is to validate a methodology for identifying the substances used to treat symptoms of opioid withdrawal by a community of people who use opioids on the social media site Reddit.We developed a named entity recognition model to extract substances and effects from nearly 4 million comments from the r\/opiates and r\/OpiatesRecovery subreddits. To identify effects that are symptoms of opioid withdrawal and substances that are potential remedies for these symptoms, we deduplicated substances and effects by using clustering and manual review, then built a network of substance and effect co-occurrence. For each of the 16 effects identified as symptoms of opioid withdrawal in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, we identified the 10 most strongly associated substances. We classified these pairs as follows: substance is a Food and Drug Administration-approved or commonly used treatment for the symptom, substance is not often used to treat the symptom but could be potentially useful given its pharmacological profile, substance is a home or natural remedy for the symptom, substance can cause the symptom, or other or unclear. We developed the Withdrawal Remedy Explorer application to facilitate the further exploration of the data.","journal":"JMIR formative research","reference":"Preiss A, Baumgartner P, Edlund MJ, Bobashev GV.

Recently, there has been a new expansion of mathematical frameworks that contain explicit representations of the vector life cycle including aquatic stages, multiple vector species, host heterogeneity in biting rate, realistic vector feeding behavior, and spatial heterogeneity. In particular, there are now multiple frameworks for spatially explicit dynamics with movements of vector, host, or both. These frameworks are flexible and powerful, but require additional data to take advantage of these features.

We tested the robustness of results to changes in POCT sensitivity, the proportion of patients getting treated immediately, the baseline proportion lost to follow-up (LTFU), and the average treatment delay.POCT could improve chlamydia prevention efforts if test performance characteristics are significantly improved over currently available options.In Analysis 1, high POCT sensitivity was needed to reduce the chlamydia-associated burden. With a POCT sensitivity of 90%, reductions from the baseline burden only occurred in scenarios in which over 60% of the screened individuals would get immediate treatment and the baseline LTFU proportion was 20%. With a POCT sensitivity of 99% (baseline LTFU 10%, 2-week treatment delay), if everyone were treated immediately, the prevalence reduction was estimated at 5.7% (95% credible interval [CrI] 3.9-8.2%). If only 30% of tested persons would wait for results, the prevalence reduction was only 1.6% (95% CrI 1.1-2.3).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) widely used social media platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic to communicate with the public and mitigate the disease in the United States. It is crucial to understand the relationships between the CDC's social media communications and the actual epidemic metrics to improve public health agencies' communication strategies during health emergencies.Four major topics from the CDC's COVID-19 tweets were identified: (1) information on the prevention of health outcomes of COVID-19; (2) pediatric intervention and family safety; (3) updates of the epidemic situation of COVID-19; and (4) research and community engagement to curb COVID-19. Multivariate analyses showed that there were significant variabilities of progression between the CDC's topics and the actual COVID-19 epidemic measures. Some CDC topics showed substantial associations with the COVID-19 measures over different time spans throughout the pandemic, expressing similar temporal dynamics between these 2 types of time series data.This study aimed to identify key topics in tweets posted by the CDC during the pandemic, investigate the temporal dynamics between these key topics and the actual COVID-19 epidemic measures, and make recommendations for the CDC's digital health communication strategies for future health emergencies.Two types of data were collected: (1) a total of 17,524 COVID-19-related English tweets posted by the CDC between December 7, 2019, and January 15, 2022, and (2) COVID-19 epidemic measures in the United States from the public GitHub repository of Johns Hopkins University from January 2020 to July 2022. Latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling was applied to identify key topics from all COVID-19-related tweets posted by the CDC, and the final topics were determined by domain experts. Various multivariate time series analysis techniques were applied between each of the identified key topics and actual COVID-19 epidemic measures to quantify the dynamic associations between these 2 types of time series data.Our study is the first to comprehensively investigate the dynamic associations between topics discussed by the CDC on Twitter and the COVID-19 epidemic measures in the United States. We identified 4 major topic themes via topic modeling and explored how each of these topics was associated with each major epidemic measure by performing various multivariate time series analyses. We recommend that it is critical for public health agencies, such as the CDC, to update and disseminate timely and accurate information to the public and align major topics with key epidemic measures over time.

Computational models play an important role in devising strategies for vaccination by making projections of its impacts on public health. Such projections are subject to uncertainty about numerous factors, however. For example, many vaccine efficacy trials focus on measuring protection against disease rather than protection against infection, leaving the extent of breakthrough infections (i.e., disease ameliorated but infection unimpeded) among vaccinees unknown. Our goal in this study was to quantify the extent to which uncertainty about breakthrough infections results in uncertainty about vaccination impact, with a focus on vaccines for dengue. To realistically account for the many forms of heterogeneity in dengue virus (DENV) transmission, which could have implications for the dynamics of indirect protection, we used a stochastic, agent-based model for DENV transmission informed by more than a decade of empirical studies in the city of Iquitos, Peru. Following 20 years of routine vaccination of nine-year-old children at 80% coverage, projections of the proportion of disease episodes averted varied by a factor of 1.76 (95% CI: 1.54-2.06) across the range of uncertainty about breakthrough infections. This was equivalent to the range of vaccination impact projected across a range of uncertainty about vaccine efficacy of 0.268 (95% CI: 0.210-0.329). Until uncertainty about breakthrough infections can be addressed empirically, our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for it in models of vaccination impact.","journal":"PLoS computational biology","reference":"Perkins TA, Reiner RC Jr., Espa\u00f1a G, Ten Bosch QA, Verma A, Liebman KA, Paz-Soldan VA, Elder JP, Morrison AC, Stoddard ST, Kitron U, Vazquez-Prokopec GM, Scott TW, Smith DL.

Yet the mechanisms underlying the spatio-temporal circulation of dengue virus (DENV) serotypes at large geographical scales remain elusive. Here we investigate the co-circulation in Asia of DENV serotypes 1-3 from 1956 to 2015, using a statistical framework that jointly estimates migration history and quantifies potential predictors of viral spatial diffusion, including socio-economic, air transportation and maritime mobility data. We find that the spread of DENV-1, -2 and -3 lineages in Asia is significantly associated with air traffic. Our analyses suggest the network centrality of air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India contribute to seeding dengue epidemics, whilst China, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Singapore may establish viral diffusion links with multiple countries in Asia.

However, we identified substantial misalignment between indications and use in both directions (indicated MSM who were not benefitting from PrEP, and MSM taking PrEP while not presently being indicated).

To assess guideline implementation, it is critical to quantify PrEP nonusers who are indicated and PrEP users who are not indicated. We sought to estimate current PrEP use among US men who have sex with men (MSM), characterize whether their PrEP use aligned with their current indications for PrEP, and assess whether the association between PrEP indications and PrEP use differed by demography or geography.Of 3508 sexually active, HIV-negative MSM, 34% met indications for PrEP.

Non-pharmaceutical interventions have been instrumental in mitigating the spread of the coronavirus. However, as we ease restrictions, widespread implementation of COVID-19 vaccines is essential to prevent its resurgence. In this work, we addressed the adequacy and deficiency of vaccine uptake within California and the possibility and severity of resurgence of COVID-19 as restrictions are lifted given the current vaccination rates. We implemented a real-time Bayesian data assimilation approach to provide projections of incident cases and deaths in California following the reopening of its economy on June 15, 2021. We implemented scenarios that vary vaccine uptake prior to reopening, and transmission rates and effective population sizes following the reopening. For comparison purposes, we adopted a baseline scenario using the current vaccination rates, which projects a total 11,429 cases and 429 deaths in a 15-day period after reopening. We used posterior estimates based on CA historical data to provide realistic model parameters after reopening. When the transmission rate is increased after reopening, we projected an increase in cases by 21.8% and deaths by 4.4% above the baseline after reopening. When the effective population is increased after reopening, we observed an increase in cases by 51.8% and deaths by 12.3% above baseline. A 30% reduction in vaccine uptake alone has the potential to increase cases and deaths by 35% and 21.6%, respectively. Conversely, increasing vaccine uptake by 30% could decrease cases and deaths by 26.1% and 17.9%, respectively. As California unfolds its plan to reopen its economy on June 15, 2021, it is critical that social distancing and public behavior changes continue to be promoted, particularly in communities with low vaccine uptake.

To achieve this, we developed advanced statistical mixed models based on mathematical models of ordinary differential equations (ODE), which allowed us to transform post-vaccination immunological processes into mathematical formulas. These models were applied to in-house data from a de novo Hepatitis B vaccination trial. By accounting for inter- and intra-individual variability, our models provided good fits for both antigen-specific Tconv and Treg cells, overcoming the challenge of studying these complex processes. Our modeling approach provided a deeper understanding of the immunological processes underlying T cell development after vaccination. Specifically, our analysis revealed several important findings regarding the dynamics of Tconv and Treg cells, as well as their relationship to seropositivity for Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1) and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), and the dynamics of antibody response to vaccination. Firstly, our modeling indicated that Tconv dynamics suggest the existence of two T cell types, in contrast to Treg dynamics where only one T cell type is predicted. Secondly, we found that individuals who converted to a positive antibody response to the vaccine earlier had lower decay rates for both Tregs and Tconv cells, which may have important implications for the development of more effective vaccination strategies. Additionally, our modeling showed that HSV-1 seropositivity negatively influenced Tconv cell expansion after the second vaccination, while EBV seropositivity was associated with higher Treg expansion rates after vaccination. Overall, this study provides a critical foundation for understanding the dynamic processes underlying T cell development after vaccination.","journal":"Vaccine","reference":"Besbassi H, Elias G, Meysman P, Jansens H, Laukens K, Damme PV, Hens N, Beutels P, Ogunjimi B.

We rapidly adapted an agent-based model (ABM) to provide weekly 30-day hospitalization forecasts (i.e., demand for intensive care unit [ICU] beds and non-ICU beds) by state and region in North Carolina for public health decision makers. The ABM was based on a synthetic population of North Carolina residents and included movement of agents (i.e., patients) among North Carolina hospitals, nursing homes, and the community. We assigned SARS-CoV-2 infection to agents using county-level compartmental models and determined agents' COVID-19 severity and probability of hospitalization using synthetic population characteristics (e.g., age, comorbidities). We generated weekly 30-day hospitalization forecasts during May-December 2020 and evaluated the impact of major model updates on statewide forecast accuracy under a SARS-CoV-2 effective reproduction number range of 1.0-1.2. Of the 21 forecasts included in the assessment, the average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was 7.8% for non-ICU beds and 23.6% for ICU beds. Among the major model updates, integration of near-real-time hospital occupancy data into the model had the largest impact on improving forecast accuracy, reducing the average MAPE for non-ICU beds from 6.6% to 3.9% and for ICU beds from 33.4% to 6.5%.

It is well established that the expected future trend in resistance depends on the reproductive fitness of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, the variability in fitness between strains with different resistance-conferring mutations has been largely ignored when making these predictions.We developed a novel approach for incorporating the variable fitness costs of drug resistance-conferring mutations and for tracking this distribution of fitness costs over time within a transmission model. We used this approach to describe the effects of realistic fitness cost distributions on the future prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis.The shape of the distribution of fitness costs was a strong predictor of the long-term prevalence of resistance. While, as expected, lower average fitness costs of drug resistance-conferring mutations were associated with more severe epidemics of drug-resistant tuberculosis, fitness distributions with greater variance also led to higher levels of drug resistance. For example, compared to simulations in which the fitness cost of resistance was fixed, introducing a realistic amount of variance resulted in a 40% increase in prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis after 20 years.The differences in the fitness costs associated with drug resistance-conferring mutations are a key determinant of the future burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis.

We developed a measles SIR model, in which the Susceptible, Infected and Recovered classes were stratified by income quintile, with income-specific transmission rates, disease-induced mortality rates, and vaccination coverage levels. We further provided a stylized illustration with secondary data from Ethiopia, where we examined various scenarios demonstrating differences in transmission patterns by income and in distributional vaccination coverage, and quantified impacts on disparities in measles mortality.The incorporation of income-specific differences can reveal distinct outbreak patterns across income groups and important differences in the subsequent effects of preventative interventions like vaccination. Our case study highlights the need to extend traditional modeling frameworks (e.g. SIR models) to be stratified by socioeconomic factors like income and to consider ensuing income-associated differences in disease-related morbidity and mortality. In so doing, we build on existing tools and characterize ongoing challenges in achieving health equity.The income-stratified SIR model exhibited similar dynamics to that of the traditional SIR model, with amplified outbreak peaks and measles mortality among the poorest income group. All vaccination coverage strategies were found to substantially curb the overall number of measles deaths, yet most considerably for the poorest, with select strategies yielding clear reductions in measles mortality disparities.Deterministic compartmental models of infectious diseases like measles typically reflect biological heterogeneities in the risk of infection and severity to characterize transmission dynamics. Given the known association of socioeconomic status and increased vulnerability to infection and mortality, it is also critical that such models further incorporate social heterogeneities.","journal":"Vaccine","reference":"Menkir TF, Jbaily A, Verguet S.

However, the effectiveness of these measures and their impacts on the associated disease burden have rarely been quantitatively assessed at the national level. To address this gap, we developed a stochastic age-stratified metapopulation model that incorporates testing, contact tracing and isolation, based on 419 million travel movements among 366 Chinese cities. The study period for this model began from September 2022. The COVID-19 disease burden was evaluated, considering 8 types of underlying health conditions in the Chinese population. We identified the marginal effects between the testing speed and reduction in the epidemic duration. The findings suggest that assuming a vaccine coverage of 89%, the Omicron-like wave could be suppressed by 3-day interval population-level testing (PLT), while it would become endemic with 4-day interval PLT, and without testing, it would result in an epidemic. PLT conducted every 3 days would not only eliminate infections but also keep hospital bed occupancy at less than 29.46% (95% CI, 22.73-38.68%) of capacity for respiratory illness and ICU bed occupancy at less than 58.94% (95% CI, 45.70-76.90%) during an outbreak.

Heterogeneous social contact patterns associated with the social structures of schools (i.e., classes\/grades) are likely to influence the within-school transmission dynamics, but data-driven evidence on fine-scale transmission patterns between students has been limited. Using a mathematical model, we analyzed a large-scale dataset of seasonal influenza outbreaks in Matsumoto city, Japan, to infer social interactions within and between classes\/grades from observed transmission patterns. While the relative contribution of within-class and within-grade transmissions to the reproduction number varied with the number of classes per grade, the overall within-school reproduction number, which determines the initial growth of cases and the risk of sustained transmission, was only minimally associated with class sizes and the number of classes per grade. This finding suggests that interventions that change the size and number of classes, e.g., splitting classes and staggered attendance, may have a limited effect on the control of school outbreaks. We also found that vaccination and mask-wearing of students were associated with reduced susceptibility (vaccination and mask-wearing) and infectiousness (mask-wearing), and hand washing was associated with increased susceptibility.

Novel vaccines effective in adolescents and adults could reduce this burden. M72\/AS01E and BCG-revaccination have recently completed Phase IIb trials and estimates of their population-level impact are needed. We estimated the potential health and economic impact of M72\/AS01E and BCG-revaccination in India and investigated the impact of variation in vaccine characteristics and delivery strategies. Methods We developed an age-stratified compartmental tuberculosis transmission model for India calibrated to country-specific epidemiology. We projected baseline epidemiology to 2050 assuming no-new-vaccine introduction, and M72\/AS01E and BCG-revaccination scenarios over 2025-2050 exploring uncertainty in product characteristics (vaccine efficacy, mechanism of effect, infection status required for vaccine efficacy, duration of protection) and implementation (achieved vaccine coverage and ages targeted). We estimated reductions in tuberculosis cases and deaths by each scenario compared to no-new-vaccine introduction, as well as costs and cost-effectiveness from health-system and societal perspectives. Results M72\/AS01E scenarios were predicted to avert 40% more tuberculosis cases and deaths by 2050 compared to BCG-revaccination scenarios. Cost-effectiveness ratios for M72\/AS01E vaccines were around seven times higher than BCG-revaccination, but nearly all scenarios were cost-effective. The estimated average incremental cost was US$190 million for M72\/AS01E and US$23 million for BCG-revaccination per year. Sources of uncertainty included whether M72\/AS01E was efficacious in uninfected individuals at vaccination, and if BCG-revaccination could prevent disease. Conclusions M72\/AS01E and BCG-revaccination could be impactful and cost-effective in India.

Contact tracing in the United States was conducted during the pre-Omicron phase of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This tracing relied on voluntary reporting and responses, often using rapid antigen tests due to lack of accessibility to PCR tests. These limitations, combined with SARS-CoV-2's propensity for asymptomatic transmission, raise the question \"how reliable was contact tracing for COVID-19 in the United States\"? We answered this question using a Markov model to examine the efficiency with which transmission could be detected based on the design and response rates of contact tracing studies in the United States. Our results suggest that contact tracing protocols in the U.S. are unlikely to have identified more than 1.65% (95% uncertainty interval: 1.62-1.68%) of transmission events with PCR testing and 1.00% (95% uncertainty interval 0.98-1.02%) with rapid antigen testing. When considering a more robust contact tracing scenario, based on compliance rates in East Asia with PCR testing, this increases to 62.7% (95% uncertainty interval: 62.6-62.8%). We did not assume presence of asymptomatic transmission or superspreading, making our estimates upper bounds on the actual percentages traced.

When temperature conditions exhibit such \u2018transcritical variation\u2019, abrupt spatial or temporal discontinuities may result, generating sharp geographical or seasonal boundaries in transmission. Here, we develop a spatio-temporal machine learning algorithm to examine the implications of transcritical variation for West Nile virus (WNV) transmission in the Los Angeles metropolitan area (LA). Analysing a large vector and WNV surveillance dataset spanning 2006\u20132016, we found that mean temperatures in the previous month strongly predicted the probability of WNV presence in pools of Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, forming distinctive inhibitory (10.0\u201321.0\u00b0C) and favourable (22.7\u201330.2\u00b0C) mean temperature ranges that bound a narrow 1.7\u00b0C transitional zone (21\u201322.7\u00b0C). Temperatures during the most intense months of WNV transmission (August\/September) were more strongly associated with infection probability in Cx. quinquefasciatus pools in coastal LA, where temperature variation more frequently traversed the narrow transitional temperature range compared to warmer inland locations. This contributed to a pronounced expansion in the geographical distribution of human cases near the coast during warmer-than-average periods. Our findings suggest that transcritical variation may influence the sensitivity of transmission to climate warming, and that especially vulnerable locations may occur where present climatic fluctuations traverse critical temperature thresholds.","journal":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B","reference":"Skaff NK, Cheng Q, Clemesha RES, Collender PA, Gershunov A, Head JR, Hoover CM, Lettenmaier DP, Rohr JR, Snyder RE, Remais JV..

The benefits of in-person learning are numerous, in terms of education quality, mental health, emotional well-being, equity and access to food and shelter. Early reports suggested that children might have reduced susceptibility to COVID-19, and children have been shown to experience fewer complications than older adults. Over the past few months, our understanding of COVID-19 has been further shaped by emerging data, and it is now understood that children are as susceptible to infection as adults and have a similar viral load during infection, even if asymptomatic. Based on this updated understanding of the disease, we have used epidemiological modeling to explore the feasibility and consequences of school reopening in the face of differing rates of COVID-19 prevalence and transmission. We focused our analysis on the United States, but the results are applicable to other countries as well. We demonstrate the potential for a large discrepancy between detected cases and true infections in schools due to the combination of high asymptomatic rates in children coupled with delays in seeking testing and receiving results from diagnostic tests. Our findings indicate that, regardless of the initial prevalence of the disease, and in the absence of robust surveillance testing and contact-tracing, most schools in the United States can expect to remain open for 20-60 days without the emergence of sizeable disease clusters. At this point, even if schools choose to close after outbreaks occur, COVID-19 cases will be seeded from these school clusters and amplified into the community. Thus, our findings suggest that the debate between the risks to student safety and benefits of in-person learning frames a false dual choice. Reopening schools without surveillance testing and contact tracing measures in place will lead to spread within the schools and within the communities that eventually forces a return to remote learning and leaves a trail of infection in its wake.","journal":"PloS one","reference":"Johnson KE, Stoddard M, Nolan RP, White DE, Hochberg NS, Chakravarty A.

Following the limited effects of a routine pyrethroid insecticide spraying campaign conducted over 2011-2013 (first period) in Avia Terai, an endemic municipality with approximately 2300 houses, we implemented a rapid-impact intervention package to suppress house infestation across the urban-to-rural gradient over 2015-2019 (second period). Here, we assess their impacts and whether persisting infestations were associated with pyrethroid resistance.The 2011-2013 campaign achieved a limited detection and spray coverage across settings (<\u200968%), more so during the surveillance phase. Following community mobilization and school-based interventions, the 2015-2019 program assessed baseline house infestation using a stratified sampling strategy; sprayed all rural houses with suspension concentrate beta-cypermethrin, and selectively sprayed infested and adjacent houses in urban and peri-urban settings; and monitored house infestation and performed selective treatments over the follow-up.The intervention package was substantially more effective than the routine insecticide spraying campaign, though the effects were lower than predicted due to unexpected incipient or moderate pyrethroid resistance. Increased awareness and diagnosis of vector control failures in the Gran Chaco, including appropriate remedial actions, are greatly needed.Over the first period, house infestation returned to pre-intervention levels within 3-4\u00a0years. The adjusted relative odds of house infestation between 2011-2013 and 2015-2016 differed very little (adj. OR: 1.17, 95% CI 0.91-1.51). Over the second period, infestation decreased significantly between 0 and 1\u00a0year post-spraying (YPS) (adj. OR: 0.36, 95% CI 0.28-0.46), with heterogeneous effects across the gradient. Mean bug abundance also dropped between 0 and 1 YPS and thereafter remained stable in rural and peri-urban areas. Using multiple regression models, house infestation and bug abundance at 1 YPS were 3-4 times higher if the house had been infested before treatment, or was scored as high-risk or non-participating. No low-risk house was ever infested. Persistent foci over two successive surveys increased from 30.0 to 59.3% across the gradient. Infestation was more concentrated in peridomestic rather than domestic habitats.

One possible new therapy is the use of oncolytic (cancer-killing) viruses. It is only recently that our ability to manipulate viral genomes has allowed us to consider deliberately infecting cancer patients with viruses. One key consideration is to ensure that the virus exclusively targets cancer cells and does not harm nearby non-cancerous cells. Here, we use a mathematical model of viral infection to determine the characteristics a virus would need to have in order to eradicate a tumor, but leave non-cancerous cells untouched. We conclude that the virus must differ in its ability to infect the two different cell types, with the infection rate of non-cancerous cells needing to be less than one hundredth of the infection rate of cancer cells. Differences in viral production rate or infectious cell death rate alone are not sufficient to protect non-cancerous cells.","journal":"Computers in biology and medicine","reference":"Buntval K, Dobrovolny HM.

To account for the current uncertainty in self-clearance properties, we varied the rate of self-clearance, and the level of protection against reinfection in self-cleared individuals. We introduced potential new vaccines in 2025, exploring vaccines that work in uninfected or infected individuals only, or that are effective regardless of infection status, and modelling scenarios with different levels of vaccine efficacy in self-cleared individuals. We then estimated the relative disease incidence reduction in 2050 for each vaccine compared with the no vaccination scenario.The inclusion of self-clearance increased the estimated relative reductions in incidence in 2050 for vaccines effective only in uninfected individuals, by a maximum of 12% in China and 8% in India. The inclusion of self-clearance increased the estimated impact of vaccines only effective in infected individuals in some scenarios and decreased it in others, by a maximum of 14% in China and 15% in India. As would be expected, the inclusion of self-clearance had minimal impact on estimated reductions in incidence for vaccines that work regardless of infection status.Our work suggests that the neglect of self-clearance in mathematical models of tuberculosis vaccines does not result in substantially biased estimates of tuberculosis vaccine impact. It may, however, mean that we are slightly underestimating the relative advantages of vaccines that work in uninfected individuals only compared with those that work in infected individuals.Mathematical modelling has been used extensively to estimate the potential impact of new tuberculosis vaccines, with the majority of existing models assuming that individuals with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection remain at lifelong risk of tuberculosis disease. Recent research provides evidence that self-clearance of Mtb infection may be common, which may affect the potential impact of new vaccines that only take in infected or uninfected individuals.

Approaches to active case-finding (ACF) and treatment tailored to their needs are required. A transmission-dynamic model was developed to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of screening with mobile Chest X-ray, GeneXpert, or both. Effectiveness of ACF depends upon the prevalence of infection in the population (which determines screening 'yield'), patient willingness to wait for GeneXpert results, and treatment adherence. ACF is efficient when TB prevalence exceeds 78\/100,000 and 46% of drug sensitive TB cases and 33% of multi-drug resistant TB cases complete treatment. This threshold increases to 92\/100,000 if additional post-ACF enhanced case management (ECM) increases treatment completion to 85%. Generally, the most efficient option is one-step screening of all patients with GeneXpert, but if too many patients (>27% without ECM, >19% with ECM) are unwilling to wait the 90\u2009minutes required then two-step screening using chest X-ray (which is rapid) followed by GeneXpert for confirmation of TB is the most efficient option.

In particular, experimental evidence suggests that influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) compete with each other, such that infection with one confers temporary protection against the other. However, such interactions are challenging to study using common epidemiologic methods. Here, we use a mathematical modeling approach, in conjunction with detailed surveillance data from Hong Kong and Canada, to infer the strength and duration of the interaction between influenza and RSV. Based on our estimates, we further utilize our model to evaluate the potential conflicting effects of live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) on RSV burden. We find evidence of a moderate to strong, negative, bidirectional interaction, such that infection with either virus yields 40-100% protection against infection with the other for one to five months. Assuming that LAIV reduces RSV susceptibility in a similar manner, we predict that the impact of such a vaccine at the population level would likely depend greatly on underlying viral circulation patterns. More broadly, we highlight the utility of mathematical models as a tool to characterize pathogen-pathogen interactions.","journal":"Nature communications","reference":"Kramer SC, Pirikahu S, Casalegno JS, Domenech de Cell\u00e8s M.

We investigate the temporal and geographical patterns of emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance. We evaluated the relationship between the spatial distance between households and genetic clustering of isolates. Most isolates were non-susceptible to fluoroquinolones, with nearly 20% containing \u22653 quinolone resistance-determining region mutations. Two H58 isolates carried an IncX3 plasmid containing blaSHV-12, associated with ceftriaxone resistance, suggesting that the ceftriaxone-resistant isolates from India independently evolved on multiple occasions. Among S. Typhi, we identified two main clades circulating (2.2 and 4.3.1 [H58]); 2.2 isolates were closely related following a single introduction around 2007, whereas H58 isolates had been introduced multiple times to the city. Increasing geographic distance between isolates was strongly associated with genetic clustering (odds ratio [OR] = 0.72 per km; 95% credible interval [CrI]: 0.66-0.79). This effect was seen for distances up to 5 km (OR = 0.65 per km; 95% CrI: 0.59-0.73) but not seen for distances beyond 5 km (OR = 1.02 per km; 95% CrI: 0.83-1.26). There was a non-significant reduction in odds of clustering for pairs of isolates in vaccination communities compared with non-vaccination communities or mixed pairs compared with non-vaccination communities. Our findings indicate that S. Typhi was repeatedly introduced into Navi Mumbai and then spread locally, with strong evidence of spatial genetic clustering. In addition to vaccination, local interventions to improve water and sanitation will be critical to interrupt transmission. IMPORTANCE Enteric fever remains a major public health concern in many low- and middle-income countries, as antimicrobial resistance (AMR) continues to emerge. Geographical patterns of typhoidal Salmonella spread, critical to monitoring AMR and planning interventions, are poorly understood. We performed whole-genome sequencing of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A isolates collected in Navi Mumbai, India before and after a typhoid conjugate vaccine introduction. From timed phylogenies, we found two dominant circulating lineages of S. Typhi in Navi Mumbai-lineage 2.2, which expanded following a single introduction a decade prior, and 4.3.1 (H58), which had been introduced repeatedly from other parts of India, frequently containing \"triple mutations\" conferring high-level ciprofloxacin resistance. Using Bayesian hierarchical statistical models, we found that spatial distance between cases was strongly associated with genetic clustering at a fine scale (<5 km). Together, these findings suggest that antimicrobial-resistant S. Typhi frequently flows between cities and then spreads highly locally, which may inform surveillance and prevention strategies.","journal":"mBio","reference":"da Silva KE, Date K, Hirani N, LeBoa C, Jayaprasad N, Borhade P, Warren J, Shimpi R, Hoffman SA, Mikoleit M, Bhatnagar P, Cao Y, Haldar P, Harvey P, Zhang C, Daruwalla S, Dharmapalan D, Gavhane J, Joshi S, Rai R, Rathod V, Shetty K, Warrier DS, Yadav S, Chakraborty D, Bahl S, Katkar A, Kunwar A, Yewale V, Dutta S, Luby SP, Andrews JR.

For tuberculosis, the greatest impact would be from reductions in timely diagnosis and treatment of new cases, which could result from any prolonged period of COVID-19 suppression interventions. The greatest impact on malaria burden could be as a result of interruption of planned net campaigns.

To better forecast and control the risk of such multiepidemics, it is essential to elucidate the potential interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with other pathogens; these interactions, however, remain poorly defined. Here, we aimed to review the current body of evidence about SARS-CoV-2 interactions. Our review is structured in four parts. To study pathogen interactions in a systematic and comprehensive way, we first developed a general framework to capture their major components: sign (either negative for antagonistic interactions or positive for synergistic interactions), strength (i.e., magnitude of the interaction), symmetry (describing whether the interaction depends on the order of infection of interacting pathogens), duration (describing whether the interaction is short-lived or long-lived), and mechanism (e.g., whether interaction modifies susceptibility to infection, transmissibility of infection, or severity of disease). Second, we reviewed the experimental evidence from animal models about SARS-CoV-2 interactions. Of the 14 studies identified, 11 focused on the outcomes of coinfection with nonattenuated influenza A viruses (IAVs), and 3 with other pathogens. The 11 studies on IAV used different designs and animal models (ferrets, hamsters, and mice) but generally demonstrated that coinfection increased disease severity compared with either monoinfection. By contrast, the effect of coinfection on the viral load of either virus was variable and inconsistent across studies. Third, we reviewed the epidemiological evidence about SARS-CoV-2 interactions in human populations. Although numerous studies were identified, only a few were specifically designed to infer interaction, and many were prone to multiple biases, including confounding. Nevertheless, their results suggested that influenza and pneumococcal conjugate vaccinations were associated with a reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, fourth, we formulated simple transmission models of SARS-CoV-2 cocirculation with an epidemic viral pathogen or an endemic bacterial pathogen, showing how they can naturally incorporate the proposed framework. More generally, we argue that such models, when designed with an integrative and multidisciplinary perspective, will be invaluable tools to resolve the substantial uncertainties that remain about SARS-CoV-2 interactions.","journal":"PLoS pathogens","reference":"Wong A, Barrero Guevara LA, Goult E, Briga M, Kramer SC, Kovacevic A, Opatowski L, Domenech de Cell\u00e8s M.

We apply an empirically parameterized model of viral transmission by the vectors Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus, as a function of temperature, to predict cumulative monthly global transmission risk in current climates, and compare them with projected risk in 2050 and 2080 based on general circulation models (GCMs). Our results show that if mosquito range shifts track optimal temperature ranges for transmission (21.3-34.0\u00b0C for Ae. aegypti; 19.9-29.4\u00b0C for Ae. albopictus), we can expect poleward shifts in Aedes-borne virus distributions. However, the differing thermal niches of the two vectors produce different patterns of shifts under climate change. More severe climate change scenarios produce larger population exposures to transmission by Ae. aegypti, but not by Ae. albopictus in the most extreme cases. Climate-driven risk of transmission from both mosquitoes will increase substantially, even in the short term, for most of Europe. In contrast, significant reductions in climate suitability are expected for Ae. albopictus, most noticeably in southeast Asia and west Africa. Within the next century, nearly a billion people are threatened with new exposure to virus transmission by both Aedes spp. in the worst-case scenario. As major net losses in year-round transmission risk are predicted for Ae. albopictus, we project a global shift towards more seasonal risk across regions. Many other complicating factors (like mosquito range limits and viral evolution) exist, but overall our results indicate that while climate change will lead to increased net and new exposures to Aedes-borne viruses, the most extreme increases in Ae. albopictus transmission are predicted to occur at intermediate climate change scenarios.","journal":"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","reference":"Ryan SJ, Carlson CJ, Mordecai EA, Johnson LR.

Although the evolution of antibiotic resistance has been theoretically studied with mathematical population dynamics models, extensions to spatial dynamics remain rare in the literature, including in particular spatial evolution of multi-drug resistance. In this study, we propose a reaction-diffusion system that describes the multi-drug evolution of bacteria based on a drug-concentration rescaling approach. We show how the resistance to drugs in space, and the consequent adaptation of growth rate, is governed by a Price equation with diffusion, integrating features of drug interactions and collateral resistances or sensitivities to the drugs. We study spatial versions of the model where the distribution of drugs is homogeneous across space, and where the drugs vary environmentally in a piecewise-constant, linear and nonlinear manner. Although in many evolution models, per capita growth rate is a natural surrogate for fitness, in spatially-extended, potentially heterogeneous habitats, fitness is an emergent property that potentially reflects additional complexities, from boundary conditions to the specific spatial variation of growth rates. Applying concepts from perturbation theory and reaction-diffusion equations, we propose an analytical metric for characterization of average mutant fitness in the spatial system based on the principal eigenvalue of our linear problem, \u03bb1. This enables an accurate translation from drug spatial gradients and mutant antibiotic susceptibility traits to the relative advantage of each mutant across the environment. Our approach allows one to predict the precise outcomes of selection among mutants over space, ultimately from comparing their \u03bb1 values, which encode a critical interplay between growth functions, movement traits, habitat size and boundary conditions. Such mathematical understanding opens new avenues for multi-drug therapeutic optimization.","journal":"PLoS computational biology","reference":"Freire TFA, Hu Z, Wood KB, Gjini E. (2024).

In adjusted models, bedsharing was associated with about 30 minutes shorter actigraphy-derived nocturnal sleep duration (p=0.005) and parent-reported later sleep midpoint (p< 0.005) in younger children. In older children, associations of bedsharing with shorter parent-reported sleep duration were more pronounced in children with greater SDB symptom burden (p=0.02), and in children with higher ratings of anxiety (p=0.048) and depressive symptoms (p=0.02).Registry: ClinicalTrials.gov; Name: Pediatric Adenotonsillectomy for Snoring (PATS); Identifier: NCT02562040.In children with mild SDB, bedsharing is associated with shorter sleep duration and later sleep timing in younger children. In older children, these relationships were modified by child factors, including SDB symptom burden and internalizing symptoms. These findings suggest that whereas age and parenting factors may play a greater role in the younger group, SDB and internalizing symptoms may play more of a role in older children who bedshare, suggesting the need to address co-occurring medical and emotional problems in children with SDB.Examine sleep patterns in children with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) who habitually bedshare.We evaluated associations of bedsharing with parent-reported (n=457) and actigraphy-based (n=258) sleep patterns in a diverse child sample (mean age 6.6\u00b12.3 years, range 3.0-12.9) with mild SDB using baseline data from the Pediatric Adenotonsillectomy Trial for Snoring. Multivariable linear regressions examined associations between sleep patterns and bedsharing, adjusting for sociodemographic, child, and parent\/environmental factors.

Our simulations and associated R package can help researchers choose the most appropriate approach for their data.We conducted a simulation study to examine how differing magnitudes of confounding affected the performance of 4 methods used for policy evaluations: (1) the two-way fixed effects difference-in-differences model; (2) a 1-period lagged autoregressive model; (3) augmented synthetic control method; and (4) the doubly robust difference-in-differences approach with multiple time periods from Callaway-Sant'Anna. We simulated our data to have staggered policy adoption and multiple confounding scenarios (i.e., varying the magnitude and nature of confounding relationships).Bias increased for each method: (1) as confounding magnitude increases; (2) when confounding is generated with respect to prior outcome trends (rather than levels), and (3) when confounding associations are nonlinear (rather than linear). The autoregressive model and augmented synthetic control method had notably lower root mean squared error than the two-way fixed effects and Callaway-Sant'Anna approaches for all scenarios; the exception is nonlinear confounding by prior trends, where Callaway-Sant'Anna excels. Coverage rates were unreasonably high for the augmented synthetic control method (e.g., 100%), reflecting large model-based standard errors and wide confidence intervals in practice.Policy evaluation studies that assess how state-level policies affect health-related outcomes are foundational to health and social policy research.

We address the well-posedness of the model and investigate the existence of steady states. The model exhibits a disease-free equilibrium and an endemic equilibrium. We calculate the reproduction number (T0). We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the bifurcation of an endemic equilibrium.

Here, we characterize collective physical distancing-mobility reductions, minimization of contacts, shortening of contact duration-in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the pre-vaccine era by analyzing de-identified, privacy-preserving location data for a panel of over 5.5 million anonymized, opted-in U.S. devices. We define five indicators of users' mobility and proximity to investigate how the emerging collective behavior deviates from typical pre-pandemic patterns during the first nine months of the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyze both the dramatic changes due to the government mandated mitigation policies and the more spontaneous societal adaptation into a new (physically distanced) normal in the fall 2020. Using the indicators here defined we show that: a) during the COVID-19 pandemic, collective physical distancing displayed different phases and was heterogeneous across geographies, b) metropolitan areas displayed stronger reductions in mobility and contacts than rural areas; c) stronger reductions in commuting patterns are observed in geographical areas with a higher share of teleworkable jobs; d) commuting volumes during and after the lockdown period negatively correlate with unemployment rates; and e) increases in contact indicators correlate with future values of new deaths at a lag consistent with epidemiological parameters and surveillance reporting delays. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the framework and indicators here presented can be used to analyze large-scale social distancing phenomena, paving the way for their use in future pandemics to analyze and monitor the effects of pandemic mitigation plans at the national and international levels.","journal":"PLOS digital health","reference":"Klein B, LaRock T, McCabe S, Torres L, Friedland L, Kos M, Privitera F, Lake B, Kraemer MUG, Brownstein JS, Gonzalez R, Lazer D, Eliassi-Rad T, Scarpino SV, Vespignani A, Chinazzi M.

In many low- and middle-income countries, inadequate surveillance and incompleteness of death registration are important barriers.The weekly mortality rate of children during the 2018-2019 measles outbreak was 161% above the expected value at its peak, and the signal can be detected earlier in children than in the general population. This approach to detect anomalies from expected baseline mortality allows us to delineate the prevalence of COVID-19 at which excess mortality would be detectable with the existing death notification system in Antananarivo.Here, we characterize how large an impact on mortality would have to be for being detectable using the uniquely detailed mortality notification data from the city of Antananarivo, Madagascar, with application to a recent measles outbreak.","journal":"International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases","reference":"Rasambainarivo F, Rasoanomenjanahary A, Rabarison JH, Ramiadantsoa T, Ratovoson R, Randremanana R, Randrianarisoa S, Rajeev M, Masquelier B, Heraud JM, Metcalf CJE, Rice BL.

Most of this research, however, has not formally considered the impact of exposure measurement error contributed by the limited spatiotemporal fidelity of precipitation data. Here, we evaluate bias in effect estimates associated with exposure misclassification due to precipitation data fidelity, using extreme rainfall as an example. We accomplished this via a simulation study, followed by analysis of extreme rainfall and incident diarrheal disease in an epidemiologic study in Ecuador. We found that the limited fidelity typical of spatiotemporal rainfall data sets biases effect estimates towards the null. Use of spatial interpolations of rain-gauge data or satellite data biased estimated health effects due to extreme rainfall (occurrence) and wet conditions (accumulated totals) downwards by 35%-45%. Similar biases were evident in the Ecuadorian case study analysis, where spatial incompatibility between exposed populations and rain gauges resulted in the association between extreme rainfall and diarrheal disease incidence being approximately halved.

Most models assume the transmission rate of a contagion either does not vary over time or change in a fixed pre-determined adhoc ways. However, these rates do vary during an outbreak due to multitude of factors such as environmental conditions, social behaviors, and public-health interventions deployed to control the disease, which are in-part guided by changing size of an outbreak. We derive analytical estimates of time-dependent transmission rate for an epidemic in terms of either incidence or prevalence using a standard mathematical SIR-type epidemic model. We illustrate applicability of our method by applying data on various public health problems, including infectious diseases (Ebola, SARS, and Leishmaniasis) and social issues (obesity and alcohol drinking) to compute transmission rates over time. We show that time-dependent transmission rate estimates can have a large variation, depending on the type of available data and other epidemiological parameters. Time-dependent estimation of transmission rates captures the dynamics of the problem better and can be utilized to understand disease progression more accurately.","journal":"Tropical medicine and infectious disease","reference":"Mubayi A, Pandey A, Brasic C, Mubayi A, Ghosh P, Ghosh A.

High-affinity antibodies to pathogens such as HIV, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2 are frequently reported to arise from B cells whose receptors, the precursors to antibodies, are encoded by particular immunoglobulin alleles. This raises the possibility that the presence of particular germline alleles in the B cell repertoire is a major determinant of the quality of the antibody response. Alternatively, initial differences in germline alleles' propensities to form high-affinity receptors might be overcome by chance events during affinity maturation. We first investigate these scenarios in simulations: when germline-encoded fitness differences are large relative to the rate and effect size variation of somatic mutations, the same germline alleles persistently dominate the response of different individuals. In contrast, if germline-encoded advantages can be easily overcome by subsequent mutations, allele usage becomes increasingly divergent over time, a pattern we then observe in mice experimentally infected with influenza virus. We investigated whether affinity maturation might nonetheless strongly select for particular amino acid motifs across diverse genetic backgrounds, but we found no evidence of convergence to similar CDR3 sequences or amino acid substitutions. These results suggest that although germline-encoded specificities can lead to similar immune responses between individuals, diverse evolutionary routes to high affinity limit the genetic predictability of responses to infection and vaccination.","journal":"PLoS pathogens","reference":"Vieira MC, Palm AE, Stamper CT, Tepora ME, Nguyen KD, Pham TD, Boyd SD, Wilson PC, Cobey S.

To account for such interplay, we develop an epidemiological model that embeds an algorithm mimicking the self-adaptive policy mechanism effective in Italy between November 2020 and March 2022. This extension is key to tracking the historical evolution of health outcomes and restrictions in Italy. Focusing on the epidemic wave that started in mid-2021 after the diffusion of Delta, we compare the functioning of alternative mechanisms to show how the policy framework may affect the trade-off between health outcomes and the restrictiveness of mitigation measures. Mechanisms based on the reproduction number are generally highly responsive to early signs of a surging wave but entail severe restrictions.

This further supports the promising potential of the abscopal effect, suggesting that in select cases, depending on tumor size, it may confer full efficacy to radiotherapy.While radiotherapy has long been recognized for its ability to directly ablate cancer cells through necrosis or apoptosis, radiotherapy-induced abscopal effect suggests that its impact extends beyond local tumor destruction thanks to immune response. Cellular proliferation and necrosis have been extensively studied using mathematical models that simulate tumor growth, such as Gompertz law, and the radiation effects, such as the linear-quadratic model. However, the effectiveness of radiotherapy-induced immune responses may vary among patients due to individual differences in radiation sensitivity and other factors.Our method leverages macroscopic observations and mathematical modeling to capture the overarching dynamics of this interplay, offering valuable insights for optimizing cancer treatment strategies. One shows that Gompertz law can describe therapy effects with two effective parameters. This result permits quantitative data analyses, which give useful indications for the disease progression and clinical decisions.We present a novel macroscopic approach designed to quantitatively analyze the intricate dynamics governing the interactions among the immune system, radiotherapy, and tumor progression.

Case-control studies are commonly undertaken to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) and present an opportunity to compare pathogen detection among individuals with and without clinically relevant symptoms. Considering this study context, we present a mathematical framework yielding simple estimators for the direct effects of vaccination on various aspects of host susceptibility. These include protection against acquisition of the pathogen of interest and protection against progression of this pathogen to disease following acquisition. We assess the impact of test sensitivity on these estimators and extend our framework to identify a 'vaccine probe' estimator for pathogen-specific aetiological fractions. We also derive biases affecting VE estimates under the test-negative design, a special case enrolling only symptomatic persons. Our results provide strategies for estimating pathogen-specific VE in the absence of a diagnostic gold standard.

Adding 2 lifetime screens helped achieve elimination over the century among all women (2120 cervical cancer incidence: 3.6 (1.9-3.6) per 100,000 women-years), but not among WLHIV (10.8 (5.3-11.6)), and averted more cumulative cancer cases overall (\u223c45% over 25 years and \u223c61% over 100 years compared to basecase) than girls' vaccination alone. Adding three-yearly cervical screening among WLHIV (to girls' vaccination and 2 lifetime cervical screens) further reduced age-standardised cervical cancer incidence to 3.3 (1.8-3.6) per 100,000 women-years overall and to 5.2 (3.9-8.5) among WLHIV by 2120 and averted on average 12-13% additional cumulative cancer cases among all women and 21-24% among WLHIV than girls' vaccination and 2 lifetime cervical screens over 25 years or longer. Long-term vaccine protection and using the nonavalent vaccine was required for elimination.In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched its initiative to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem. To inform global efforts for countries with high HIV and cervical cancer burden, we assessed the impact of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and cervical cancer screening and treatment in South Africa, on cervical cancer and the potential for achieving elimination before 2120, considering faster HPV disease progression and higher cervical cancer risk among women living with HIV(WLHIV) and HIV interventions.Three independent transmission-dynamic models simulating HIV and HPV infections and disease progression were used to predict the impact on cervical cancer incidence of three scenarios for all women: 1) girls' vaccination (9-14 years old), 2) girls' vaccination plus 1 lifetime cervical screen (at 35 years), and 3) girls' vaccination plus 2 lifetime cervical screens (at 35 and 45 years) and three enhanced scenarios for WLHIV: 4) vaccination of young WLHIV aged 15-24 years, 5) three-yearly cervical screening of WLHIV aged 15-49 years, or 6) both. Vaccination assumed 90% coverage and 100% lifetime protection with the nonavalent vaccine (against HPV-16\/18\/31\/33\/45\/52\/58). Cervical cancer screening assumed HPV testing with uptake increasing from 45% (2023), 70% (2030) to 90% (2045+). We also assumed that UNAIDS 90-90-90 HIV treatment and 70% male circumcision targets are reached by 2030. We examined three elimination thresholds: age-standardised cervical cancer incidence rates below 4 or 10 per 100,000 women-years, and >85% reduction in cervical cancer incidence rate. We conducted sensitivity analyses and presented the median age-standardised predictions of outcomes of the three models (minimum-maximum across models).","journal":"EClinicalMedicine","reference":"Boily MC, Barnabas RV, R\u00f6nn MM, Bayer CJ, van Schalkwyk C, Soni N, Rao DW, Staadegaard L, Liu G, Silhol R, Brisson M, Johnson LF, Bloem P, Gottlieb S, Broutet N, Dalal S.

We also built a simple mathematical model of the point prevalence of infection in visitors to an epicentre relative to that in residents.The weighted global ability to detect Wuhan-to-location imported cases of COVID-19 was estimated to be 38% (95% highest posterior density interval [HPDI] 22-64) of Singapore's capacity. This value is equivalent to 2\u00b78 (95% HPDI 1\u00b75-4\u00b74) times the current number of imported and reported cases that could have been detected if all locations had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore was 40% (95% HPDI 22-67) among locations with high surveillance capacity, 37% (18-68) among locations with medium surveillance capacity, and 11% (0-42) among locations with low surveillance capacity. Treating all travellers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travellers in Wuhan) contributed modestly to underestimation of prevalence.The incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, has been estimated using imported case counts of international travellers, generally under the assumptions that all cases of the disease in travellers have been ascertained and that infection prevalence in travellers and residents is the same. However, findings indicate variation among locations in the capacity for detection of imported cases. Singapore has had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact tracing capacity during previous infectious disease outbreaks and has consistently shown high sensitivity of case-detection during the COVID-19 outbreak.Estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of 100% detection in travellers could have been underestimated by several fold. Furthermore, severity estimates will be inflated several fold since they also rely on case count estimates. Finally, our model supports evidence that underdetected cases of COVID-19 have probably spread in most locations around the world, with greatest risk in locations of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicentre of the outbreak.","journal":"The Lancet.

However, making this determination remains a difficult clinical task. Recently, a novel spatiotemporal boundary detection predictor of glaucomatous visual field (VF) progression (STBound) was developed. In this work, we explore the ability of STBound to differentiate progressing and non-progressing glaucoma patients in comparison to existing methods. STBound, Spatial PROGgression, and traditional trend-based progression methods (global index (GI) regression, mean regression slope, point-wise linear regression, permutation of pointwise linear regression) were applied to longitudinal VF data from 191 eyes of 91 glaucoma patients. The ability of each method to identify progression was compared using Akaike information criterion (AIC), full\/partial area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC\/pAUC), sensitivity, and specificity. STBound offered improved diagnostic ability (AIC: 197.77 vs. 204.11-217.55; AUC: 0.74 vs. 0.63-0.70) and showed no correlation (r: -0.01-0.11; p-values: 0.11-0.93) with the competing methods. STBound combined with GI (the top performing competitor) provided improved performance over all individual metrics and compared to all metrics combined with GI (all p-values\u2009<\u20090.05).

To understand and forecast the transmission dynamics of this disease, fractional-order derivative-based modeling can be beneficial. We propose in this paper a fractional-order mathematical model to examine the COVID-19 disease outbreak. This model outlines the multiple mechanisms of transmission within the dynamics of infection. The basic reproduction number and the equilibrium points are calculated from the model to assess the transmissibility of the COVID-19. Sensitivity analysis is discussed to explain the significance of the epidemic parameters. The existence and uniqueness of the solution to the proposed model have been proven using the fixed-point theorem and by helping the Arzela-Ascoli theorem. Using the predictor-corrector algorithm, we approximated the solution of the proposed model. The results obtained are represented by using figures that illustrate the behavior of the predicted model classes. Finally, the study of the stability of the numerical method is carried out using some results and primary lemmas.","journal":"Mathematical methods in the applied sciences","reference":"Agarwal P, Ramadan MA, Rageh AAM, Hadhoud AR.

We propose that outbreaks described with varied data types can be directly compared by using those data to estimate a common set of epidemiological parameters. To demonstrate this for chikungunya virus (CHIKV), we developed a realistic model of CHIKV transmission, along with a Bayesian inference method that accommodates any type of outbreak data that can be simulated. The inference method makes use of the fact that all data types arise from the same transmission process, which is simulated by the model. We applied these tools to data from three real-world outbreaks of CHIKV in Italy, Cambodia, and Bangladesh to estimate nine model parameters. We found that these populations differed in several parameters, including pre-existing immunity and house-to-house differences in mosquito activity. These differences resulted in posterior predictions of local CHIKV transmission risk that varied nearly fourfold: 16% in Italy, 28% in Cambodia, and 62% in Bangladesh. Our inference method and model can be applied to improve understanding of the epidemiology of CHIKV and other pathogens for which outbreaks are described with varied data types.","journal":"Epidemics","reference":"Meyer AD, Guerrero SM, Dean NE, Anderson KB, Stoddard ST, Perkins TA.

Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are highly responsive to environmental changes, but such responses are notoriously difficult to isolate because pathogen transmission depends on a suite of ecological and social responses in vectors and hosts that may differ across species. Here we use the emerging tools of cumulative pressure mapping and machine learning to better understand how the occurrence of six medically important VBDs, differing in ecology from sylvatic to urban, respond to multidimensional effects of human pressure. We find that not only is human footprint-an index of human pressure, incorporating built environments, energy and transportation infrastructure, agricultural lands and human population density-an important predictor of VBD occurrence, but there are clear thresholds governing the occurrence of different VBDs. Across a spectrum of human pressure, diseases associated with lower human pressure, including malaria, cutaneous leishmaniasis and visceral leishmaniasis, give way to diseases associated with high human pressure, such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. These heterogeneous responses of VBDs to human pressure highlight thresholds of land-use transitions that may lead to abrupt shifts in infectious disease burdens and public health needs.","journal":"Nature sustainability","reference":"Skinner EB, Glidden CK, MacDonald AJ, Mordecai EA.

We use mathematical modeling and simulations to find the unfolded site frequency spectrum (SFS) left by hitchhiking in the genomic region of a sweep in a population occupying a one-dimensional range. For such populations, sweeps spread as Fisher waves, rather than logistically. We find that this leaves a characteristic three-part SFS at loci very close to the swept locus. Very low frequencies are dominated by recent mutations that occurred after the sweep and are unaffected by hitchhiking. At moderately low frequencies, there is a transition zone primarily composed of alleles that briefly \"surfed\" on the wave of the sweep before falling out of the wavefront, leaving a spectrum close to that expected in well-mixed populations. However, for moderate-to-high frequencies, there is a distinctive scaling regime of the SFS produced by alleles that drifted to fixation in the wavefront and then were carried throughout the population. For loci slightly farther away from the swept locus on the genome, recombination is much more effective at restoring diversity in one-dimensional populations than it is in well-mixed ones. We find that these signatures of space can be strong even in apparently well-mixed populations with negligible spatial genetic differentiation, suggesting that spatial structure may frequently distort the signatures of hitchhiking in natural populations.","journal":"Genetics","reference":"Min J, Gupta M, Desai MM, Weissman DB.

Debates over the proper understanding of structure, agency, and constraint are hindered by the fact that few if any empirical measures of these concepts have been proposed. As sociologists have long recognized, the total results of the decisions of a group's members can be viewed as a distribution, and parameters can be fit to obtain a description of observed distributions. Here we propose the use of negative binomial curve to model population survival outcomes, and suggest that the parameters of such a curve represent reasonable surrogates for measures of agency, opportunity, and constraint when the decision process can be thought of as akin to a Bernoulli process. To provide an illustration of this approach, we discuss participation of legal minors in commercial sex (commonly referred to as victims of domestic minor sex trafficking (VDMST) or commercially sexually exploited children (CSEC)). In popular and advocacy-based accounts, considerable focus has been placed on the relative powerlessness of female VDMST. Using the proposed modeling technique, we test the extent to which male versus female VDMST appear to possess greater agency (or function under more limiting constraint) when deciding whether to remain in sex work or \"leave the life\". Contrary to existing literature, our results indicate that male and female underage sex workers are experiencing similar levels of agency, and differ mainly in opportunity, and constraint. Other individual circumstances are shown to contribute to varying levels of agency and constraint among sex workers, including street work status, community trouble, drug use, and the availability of an alternative income.","journal":"Social science research","reference":"Khan B, Lee HW, Thrash CR, Dombrowski K.

Intrinsically, the wild-type and delta variant caused similar symptoms among unvaccinated symptomatic cases, whereas the wild-type and omicron BA.2 subvariant had heterogeneous patterns, with seven symptoms (fatigue, fever, chest pain, runny nose, sputum production, nausea\/vomiting, and sore throat) more frequent in the BA.2 cohort.

In this study, we explore the possibility that a PP intervention with partial coverage may have the counterintuitive effect of increasing disease burden at the population level, by increasing the biting intensity on the unprotected portion of the population. To this end, we have developed a dynamic model which incorporates parameters that describe the potential effects of PP on vector searching and biting behaviour and calculated its basic reproductive rate, R0. R0 is a well-established threshold of disease risk; the higher R0 is above unity, the stronger the disease onset intensity. When R0 is below unity, the disease is typically unable to persist. The model analysis revealed that partial coverage with popular PP techniques can realistically lead to a substantial increase in the reproductive number. An increase in R0 implies an increase in disease burden and difficulties in eradication efforts within certain parameter regimes. Our findings therefore stress the importance of studying vector behavioural patterns in response to PP interventions for future mitigation of vector-borne diseases.

A sectoral, whole-economy macroeconomic model was linked to a population-wide epidemiological demographic model to assess the potential macroeconomic impact of COVID-19, together with policies to mitigate or suppress the pandemic by means of home quarantine, school closures, social distancing and accompanying business closures. Our simulations indicate that, assuming a clinical attack rate of 48% and a case fatality ratio of 1.5%, COVID-19 alone would impose a direct health-related economic burden of \u00a339.6bn (1.73% of GDP) on the UK economy. Mitigation strategies imposed for 12 weeks reduce case fatalities by 29%, but the total cost to the economy is \u00a3308bn (13.5% of GDP); \u00a366bn (2.9% of GDP) of which is attributable to labour lost from working parents during school closures, and \u00a3201bn (8.8% of GDP) of which is attributable to business closures. Suppressing the pandemic over a longer period of time may reduce deaths by 95%, but the total cost to the UK economy also increases to \u00a3668bn (29.2% of GDP), where \u00a3166bn (7.3% of GDP) is attributable to school closures and 502bn (21.9% of GDP) to business closures. Our analyses suggest Covid-19 has the potential to impose unprecedented economic costs on the UK economy, and whilst public actions are necessary to minimise mortality, the duration of school and business closures are key to determining the economic cost. The initial economic support package promised by the UK government may be proportionate to the costs of mitigating Covid-19, but without alternative measures to reduce the scale and duration of school and business closures, the economic support may be insufficient to compensate for longer term suppression of the pandemic which could generate an even greater health impact through major recession.","journal":"SSM - population health","reference":"Keogh-Brown MR, Jensen HT, Edmunds WJ, Smith RD.

We requested county-level kindergarten vaccination data from state health departments, and mapped these data to visualize geographic patterns in achievement of the 95% MMR vaccination target. We aggregated the county-level data to the state level for comparison against CDC state estimates. We also analyzed the relationship of MMR vaccination level with county-level and state-level poverty (using U.S. census data), using both a national mixed model with state as a random effect, and individual linear regression models by state. We received county vaccination data from 43 states.

Efficacy of prophylactic drug treatments targeting a particular pathogen is often short-lived, as drug-resistant pathogens evolve and reach high frequency in a treated population. Methods to combat drug resistance are usually costly, including use of multiple drugs that are applied jointly or sequentially, or development of novel classes of drugs. Alternatively, there is growing interest in exploiting untreated host populations, refugia, for the management of drug resistance. Refugia do not experience selection for resistance, and serve as a reservoir for native, drug-susceptible pathogens. The force of infection from refugia may dilute the frequency of resistant pathogens in the treated population, potentially at an acceptable cost in terms of overall disease burden. We examine this concept using a simple mathematical model that captures the core mechanisms of transmission and selection common to many host-pathogen systems. We identify the roles of selection and gene flow in determining the utility of refugia. ","journal":"Biology letters","reference":"Park AW, Haven J, Kaplan R, Gandon S. (2015).

This system collects data on malaria cases passively detected and reported by all health facilities (index cases), and household-based reactive case detection (RCD) activities linked to those primary cases. All members of households of the index cases were screened for malaria using a malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Individuals with a positive RDT were treated with artemisinin-based combination therapy. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were done to investigate the association between RDT positivity among the household members and explanatory factors with adjustment for seasonality and clustering at Shehia level.The findings suggest that vector control remains an important malaria prevention intervention: they underscore the need to maintain universal access to LLINs, the persistent promotion of LLIN use, and application of IRS.

Country-specific routine MCV1 and MCV2 coverage data during 1980-2020 were obtained from the WHO and UNICEF Estimates of National Immunization Coverage database for all modelled countries and SIA data were obtained from the WHO summary of measles and rubella SIAs. We estimated the incremental health effects of different vaccination strategies using prevented cases of measles and deaths from measles and their efficiency using the incremental number needed to vaccinate (NNV) to prevent an additional measles case.Vaccination strategies, including non-selective SIAs, reach a greater proportion of children who are unvaccinated and reduce measles burden more than MCV2 alone, but efficiency is lower because of the wide age range targeted by SIAs. This analysis provides information to help improve the health effects and efficiency of measles vaccination strategies. The interplay between MCV1, MCV2, and SIAs should be considered when planning future measles vaccination strategies.Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.Compared with no vaccination, MCV1 implementation was estimated to have prevented 824 million cases of measles and 9\u00b76 million deaths from measles, with a median NNV of 1\u00b741 (IQR 1\u00b735-1\u00b744).

Quantification of contact patterns is crucial to parameterize dynamic transmission models and to provide insights on the (basic) reproduction number. Information on social interactions can be obtained from population-based contact surveys, such as the European Commission project POLYMOD. Estimation of age-specific contact rates from these studies is often done using a piecewise constant approach or bivariate smoothing techniques. For the latter, typically, smoothness is introduced in the dimensions of the respondent's and contact's age (i.e., the rows and columns of the social contact matrix). We propose a smoothing constrained approach-taking into account the reciprocal nature of contacts-introducing smoothness over the diagonal (including all subdiagonals) of the social contact matrix. This modeling approach is justified assuming that when people age their contact behavior changes smoothly. We call this smoothing from a cohort perspective. Two approaches that allow for smoothing over social contact matrix diagonals are proposed, namely (i) reordering of the diagonal components of the contact matrix and (ii) reordering of the penalty matrix ensuring smoothness over the contact matrix diagonals. Parameter estimation is done in the likelihood framework by using constrained penalized iterative reweighted least squares. A simulation study underlines the benefits of cohort-based smoothing. Finally, the proposed methods are illustrated on the Belgian POLYMOD data of 2006.

Even where control programs have succeeded in driving measles locally extinct, unless vaccination coverage is maintained at extremely high levels, susceptible numbers may increase sufficiently to spark large outbreaks. Human mobility will drive potentially infectious contacts and interact with the landscape of susceptibility to determine the pattern of measles outbreaks. These interactions have proved difficult to characterise empirically. We explore the degree to which new sources of data combined with existing public health data can be used to evaluate the landscape of immunity and the role of spatial movement for measles introductions by retrospectively evaluating our ability to predict measles outbreaks in vaccinated populations. Using inferred spatial patterns of accumulation of susceptible individuals and travel data, we predicted the timing of epidemics in each district of Pakistan during a large measles outbreak in 2012-2013 with over 30 000 reported cases. We combined these data with mobility data extracted from over 40 million mobile phone subscribers during the same time frame in the country to quantify the role of connectivity in the spread of measles. We investigate how different approaches could contribute to targeting vaccination efforts to reach districts before outbreaks started. While some prediction was possible, accuracy was low and we discuss key uncertainties linked to existing data streams that impede such inference and detail what data might be necessary to robustly infer timing of epidemics.","journal":"Epidemiology and infection","reference":"Wesolowski A, Winter A, Tatem AJ, Qureshi T, Eng\u00f8-Monsen K, Buckee CO, Cummings DAT, Metcalf CJE.

To address this, we present a new circular statistical framework that defines an Angular Decay function and thereby provides a directionally precise representation of an eye with attention to patterns of focused RNFL loss. By applying to a clinical cohort of Asian Indian eyes, the generated circular data were modeled with a finite mixture of von Mises distributions, which led to an unsupervised identification in different age-groups of recurrent clusters of glaucomatous eyes with distinct directional signatures of RNFL decay. New indices of global and local RNFL loss were computed for comparing the structural differences between these glaucoma clusters across the age-groups and improving classification.

However, the reported effectiveness of masking has been much lower than laboratory measures of efficacy, leading to doubts on the utility of masking. Here, we develop an agent-based model that comprehensively accounts for individual masking behaviours and infectious disease dynamics, and test the impact of masking on epidemic outcomes. Using realistic inputs of mask efficacy and contact data at the individual level, the model reproduces the lower effectiveness as reported in randomized controlled trials. Model results demonstrate that transmission within households, where masks are rarely used, can substantially lower effectiveness, and reveal the interaction of nonlinear epidemic dynamics, control measures and potential measurement biases. Overall, model results show that, at the individual level, consistent masking can reduce the risk of first infection and, over time, reduce the frequency of repeated infection. At the population level, masking can provide direct protection to mask wearers, as well as indirect protection to non-wearers, collectively reducing epidemic intensity. These findings suggest it is prudent for individuals to use masks during an epidemic, and for policymakers to recognize the less-than-ideal effectiveness of masking when devising public health interventions.","journal":"Journal of the Royal Society, Interface","reference":"Yang W, Shaman J.

We evaluated the performance of ODAC with (1) a simulation study and (2) a real-world use case study using 4 datasets from the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics network.We developed and evaluated a privacy-preserving One-shot Distributed Algorithm to fit a multicenter Cox proportional hazards model (ODAC) without sharing patient-level information across sites.On the one hand, our simulation study showed that ODAC provided estimates nearly the same as the estimator obtained by analyzing, in a single dataset, the combined patient-level data from all sites (ie, the pooled estimator). The relative bias was <0.1% across all scenarios. The accuracy of ODAC remained high across different sample sizes and event rates. On the other hand, the meta-analysis estimator, which was obtained by the inverse variance weighted average of the site-specific estimates, had substantial bias when the event rate is <5%, with the relative bias reaching 20% when the event rate is 1%. In the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics network application, the ODAC estimates have a relative bias <5% for 15 out of 16 log hazard ratios, whereas the meta-analysis estimates had substantially higher bias than ODAC.ODAC is a privacy-preserving and noniterative method for implementing time-to-event analyses across multiple sites.

In the main model, we evaluated influenza vaccine uptake in all those age 6\u00a0months and older. We used a mixed-effects regression analysis with generalised least squares estimation to account for within state correlation in P&I mortality.These results using a population-level statistical approach provide additional support for the overall effectiveness of the US influenza vaccination program. This reassurance is critical given the importance of ensuring confidence in this life saving program. Future research is needed to expand on our approach using more refined data.From 2013-2014 through 2018-2019, the total number of all-age P&I related deaths during the influenza seasons was 480,111. The mean overall cumulative influenza vaccine uptake (age 6\u00a0months and older) across the states and years considered was 46.7%, with higher uptake (64.8%) observed in those aged\u00a0\u2265\u00a065\u00a0years. We found that overall influenza vaccine uptake (6\u00a0months and older) had a statistically significant protective association with the P&I death rate. This translated to a 0.33 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.47) per 100,000 population reduction in P&I deaths in the influenza season per 1% increase in overall influenza vaccine uptake.The influenza mortality burden has remained substantial in the United States (US) despite relatively high levels of influenza vaccine uptake. This has led to questions regarding the effectiveness of the program against this outcome, particularly in the elderly. The aim of this evaluation was to develop and explore a new approach to estimating the population-level effect of influenza vaccination uptake on pneumonia and influenza (P&I) associated deaths.","journal":"Vaccine","reference":"Newall AT, Nazareno AL, Muscatello DJ, Boettiger D, Viboud C, Simonsen L, Turner RM.

Use of individual-level serological tests to redirect doses to seronegative individuals improved the marginal impact of each dose while potentially reducing existing inequities in COVID-19 impact.

In this model, individuals progress through different pathways (e.g. may recover, die, or progress to intensive care and recover or die) and data from a partially complete patient-pathway line-list was used to provide initial estimates of the mean duration that individuals spend in the different hospital compartments. We then fitted EpiBeds using complete data on hospital occupancy and hospital deaths, enabling estimation of the proportion of individuals that follow the different clinical pathways, the reproduction number of the generalised epidemic, and to make short-term predictions of hospital bed demand.

Results of norovirus vaccine trials have been promising, however there are open questions as to whether vaccination of daycare children would be cost-effective. We investigated the incremental cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical norovirus vaccination for children in daycare settings compared to no vaccination.We conducted a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis using a disease transmission model of children attending daycare. Vaccination with a 90% coverage rate in addition to the observed standard of care (exclusion of symptomatic children from daycare) was compared to the observed standard of care. The main outcomes measures were infections and deaths averted, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Cost-effectiveness was analyzed from a societal perspective, including medical costs to children as well as productivity losses of parents, over a two-year time horizon. Data sources included outbreak surveillance data and published literature.Due to the large disease burden associated with norovirus, it is likely that vaccinating children in daycares could be cost-effective, even with modest vaccine efficacy and a high per-child cost of vaccination. Norovirus vaccination of children in daycare has a cost-effectiveness ratio similar to other commonly recommended childhood vaccines.A 50% efficacious norovirus vaccine averts 571.83 norovirus cases and 0.003 norovirus-related deaths per 10,000 children compared to the observed standard of care. A $200 norovirus vaccine that is 50% efficacious has a net cost increase of $178.10 per child and 0.025 more QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $7,028\/QALY. Based on the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, we estimated that a $200 vaccination with 50% efficacy was 94.0% likely to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of $100,000\/QALY threshold and 95.3% likely at a $150,000\/QALY threshold.","journal":"Vaccine","reference":"Steimle LN, Havumaki J, Eisenberg MC, Eisenberg JNS, Prosser LA, Pike J, Ortega-Sanchez IR, Mattison CP, Hall AJ, Steele MK, Lopman BA, Hutton DW.

Respiratory diseases and gastrointestinal or enteroviral diseases declined more than sexually transmitted or bloodborne diseases and vector-borne or zoonotic diseases. Early pandemic phases with more stringent NPIs were associated with greater reductions in disease incidence. Non-respiratory diseases, such as hand, foot and mouth disease, rebounded substantially towards the end of the year 2020 as the NPIs were relaxed.

Targeting HCWs had a higher per-regimen impact than population-wide vaccination.Despite large outbreaks in humans seeming improbable for a number of zoonotic pathogens, several pose a concern due to their epidemiological characteristics and evolutionary potential. To enable effective responses to these pathogens in the event that they undergo future emergence, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations is advancing the development of vaccines for several pathogens prioritized by the World Health Organization. A major challenge in this pursuit is anticipating demand for a vaccine stockpile to support outbreak response.Our framework provides a flexible methodology for estimating vaccine stockpile needs and the geographic distribution of demand under a range of outbreak response scenarios. Uncertainties in our model estimates highlight several knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to target vulnerable populations more accurately. These include surveillance gaps that mask the true geographic distribution of each pathogen, details of key routes of spillover from animal reservoirs to humans, and the role of human-to-human transmission outside of healthcare settings. In addition, our estimates are based on the current epidemiology of each pathogen, but pathogen evolution could alter vaccine stockpile requirements.We developed a modeling framework for outbreak response for emerging zoonoses under three reactive vaccination strategies to assess sustainable vaccine manufacturing needs, vaccine stockpile requirements, and the potential impact of the outbreak response. This framework incorporates geographically variable zoonotic spillover rates, human-to-human transmission, and the implementation of reactive vaccination campaigns in response to disease outbreaks. As proof of concept, we applied the framework to four priority pathogens: Lassa virus, Nipah virus, MERS coronavirus, and Rift Valley virus.","journal":"BMC medicine","reference":"Lerch A, Ten Bosch QA, L'Azou Jackson M, Bettis AA, Bernuzzi M, Murphy GAV, Tran QM, Huber JH, Siraj AS, Bron GM, Elliott M, Hartlage CS, Koh S, Strimbu K, Walters M, Perkins TA, Moore SM.

One study found decreases of 6%-11% per month during the 2011-12 to 2014-15 seasons. These findings could indicate waning immunity but could also occur if vaccine effectiveness is stable and vaccine provides partial protection in all vaccinees (\"leaky\") rather than complete protection in a subset of vaccinees. Since it is not known whether influenza vaccine is leaky, we simulated the 2011-12 to 2014-15 influenza seasons to estimate the potential contribution of leaky vaccine effect to the observed decline in mVE.We used available data to estimate daily numbers of vaccinations and infections with A\/H1N1, A\/H3N2 and B viruses. We assumed that vaccine effect was leaky, calculated mVE as 1 minus the Mantel-Haenszel relative risk of vaccine on incident cases and determined the mean mVE change per 30 days since vaccination. Because change in mVE was highly dependent on infection rates, we performed simulations using low (15%) and high (31%) total (including symptomatic and asymptomatic) seasonal infection rates.For the low infection rate, decreases (absolute) in mVE per 30 days after vaccination were 2% for A\/H1N1 and 1% for A\/H3N2and B viruses. For high infection rate, decreases were 5% for A\/H1N1, 4% for A\/H3, and 3% for B viruses.The leaky vaccine bias could account for some, but probably not all of the observed intra-seasonal decreases in mVE. These results underscore the need for strategies to deal with intra-seasonal vaccine effectiveness decline.","journal":"Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America","reference":"Tokars JI, Patel MM, Foppa IM, Reed C, Fry AM, Ferdinands JM.

The Communities Organized to Prevent Arboviruses (COPA) study is a cohort in southern Puerto Rico to measure arboviral prevalence, evaluate interventions, and collect mobility data. To quantify the relationship between arboviral prevalence and human mobility patterns, we fit multilevel logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios for mobility-related predictors of positive chikungunya IgG or Zika IgM test results collected from COPA, assuming mobility data does not change substantially from year to year. From May 8, 2018-June 8, 2019, 39% of the 1,845 active participants during the study period had a positive arboviral seroprevalence result. Most (74%) participants reported spending five or more weekly hours outside of their home. A 1% increase in weekly hours spent outside the home was associated with a 4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2-7%) decrease in the odds of testing positive for arbovirus. After adjusting for age and whether a person had air conditioning (AC) at home, any time spent in a work location was protective against arbovirus infection (32% decrease, CI: 9-49%). In fact, there was a general decreased prevalence for individuals who visited locations that were inside and had AC or screens, regardless of the type of location (32% decrease, CI: 12-47%). In this population, the protective characteristics of locations visited appear to be the most important driver of the relationship between mobility and arboviral prevalence. This relationship indicates that not all mobility is the same, with elements like screens and AC providing protection in some locations. These findings highlight the general importance of AC and screens, which are known to be protective against mosquitoes and mosquito-transmitted diseases.","journal":"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","reference":"Phillips MT, S\u00e1nchez-Gonz\u00e1lez L, Shragai T, Rodriguez DM, Major CG, Johansson MA, Rivera-Amill V, Paz-Bailey G, Adams LE.

Both a polysaccharide vaccine targeting 23\u00a0serotypes (PPV23) and a 13-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV13) are indicated for persons aged over 50\u00a0years. We developed and parameterized a static multi-cohort model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness and budget-impact of these vaccines at different uptake levels. Using three different vaccine efficacy scenarios regarding non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia and extensive uni- and multivariate sensitivity analyses, we found a strong preference for PPV23 over PCV13 in all age groups at willingness to pay levels below \u20ac300 000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY).

Strategies combining PPV23 and PCV13 vaccines were most effective but generally less cost-effective. When assuming a combination of increased duration of PCV13 protection, increased disease burden preventable by PCV13 and a 75% reduction of the PCV13 price, PCV13 could become more attractive in <75 year olds, but would remain less attractive than PPV23 from age 75\u00a0years onwards. These observations are independent of the assumption that PPV23 has 0% efficacy against non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia. Pneumococcal vaccination would be most cost-effective in Belgium, when achieving high uptake with PPV23 in 75-84 year olds, as well as by negotiating a lower market-conform PPV23 price to improve uptake and cost-effectiveness.","journal":"Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics","reference":"Willem L, Blommaert A, Hanquet G, Thiry N, Bilcke J, Theeten H, Verhaegen J, Goossens H, Beutels P.

Thus, strategies protecting workers should prioritize close contact transmission pathways, such as physical distancing, universal mask use, and room air changes, with surface disinfection (reducing fomite transmission) and handwashing of secondary importance. Our work supports current international (EU-OSHA), domestic (FDA, OSHA), and food industry-standard guidance for managing COVID-19 transmission in essential workers in the food manufacturing sector. Although our model was designed for an indoor food manufacturing setting, it can be readily adapted to other indoor environments and infectious respiratory pathogens.The SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic poses significant health risks to workers who are essential to maintaining the food supply chain. Using a quantitative risk assessment model, this study characterized the impact of risk reduction strategies for controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission (droplet, aerosol, fomite-mediated) among front-line workers in a representative enclosed food manufacturing facility. We simulated: 1) individual and cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infection risks from close contact (droplet and aerosols at 1-3m), aerosol, and fomite-mediated exposures to a susceptible worker following exposure to an infected worker during an 8h-shift; and 2) the relative reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection risk attributed to infection control interventions (physical distancing, mask use, ventilation, surface disinfection, hand hygiene). Without mitigation measures, the SARS-CoV-2 infection risk was largest for close contact (droplet and aerosol) at 1m (0.96, 95%CI: 0.67-1.0). In comparison, risk associated with fomite (0.26, 95%CI: 0.10-0.56) or aerosol exposure alone (0.05, 95%CI: 0.01-0.13) at 1m distance was substantially lower (73-95%). At 1m, droplet transmission predominated over aerosol and fomite-mediated transmission, however, this changed by 3m, with aerosols comprising the majority of the exposure dose. Increasing physical distancing reduced risk by 84% (1 to 2m) and 91% (1 to 3m). Universal mask use reduced infection risk by 52-88%, depending on mask type. Increasing ventilation (from 0.1 to 2-8 air changes\/hour) resulted in risk reductions of 14-54% (1m) and 55-85% (2m).

This One Health study in southern Chile examined Leptospira serological evidence of exposure in people from urban slums, semi-rural settings, and farm settings, using the Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm to identify key influencing factors. In urban slums, age, shrub terrain, distance to Leptospira-positive households, and neighborhood housing density were contributing factors. Human exposure in semi-rural communities was linked to environmental factors (trees, shrubs, and lower vegetation terrain) and animal variables (Leptospira-positive dogs and rodents and proximity to Leptospira-positive households).

Dynamic toll pricing schemes effectively achieve reliable travel time on ELs. The primary inputs for the typical dynamic pricing algorithms are vehicular volumes and speeds derived from the data collected by sensors installed along the ELs. Thus, the operation of dynamic pricing critically depends on the accuracy of data collected by such traffic sensors. However, no previous research has been conducted to explicitly investigate the impact of sensor failures and erroneous sensors' data on toll computations. This research fills this gap by examining the effects of sensor failure and faulty detection scenarios on ELs tolls calculated by a dynamic pricing algorithm. The paper's methodology relies on applying the dynamic toll pricing algorithm implemented in the field and utilizing the fundamental speed-volume relationship to 'simulate' the sensors' reported data. We implemented the methodology in a case study of ELs on Interstate-95 in Southeast Florida. The results have shown that the tolls increase when sensors erroneously report higher than actual traffic demand. Moreover, it has been found that the accuracy of individual sensors and the number of sensors utilized to estimate traffic conditions are critical for accurate toll calculations.","journal":"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","reference":"Alshayeb S, Stevanovic A, Mitrovic N, Dimitrijevic B.

Here, we examine the spatial variability of the basic reproductive numbers of COVID-19 across provinces and cities in China and show that environmental variables alone cannot explain this variability. Our findings suggest that changes in weather (i.e., increase of temperature and humidity as spring and summer months arrive in the Northern Hemisphere) will not necessarily lead to declines in case counts without the implementation of drastic public health interventions.","journal":"Scientific reports","reference":"Poirier C, Luo W, Majumder MS, Liu D, Mandl KD, Mooring TA, Santillana M.

The increased incidence has been attributed primarily to the detection of subclinical disease, raising important questions related to thyroid cancer control. We developed the Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma Microsimulation model (PATCAM) to answer them including the impact of overdiagnosis on thyroid cancer incidence.PATCAM successfully reproduced observed US thyroid cancer incidence and mortality over time and was externally validated. PATCAM can be used to identify factors that influence the detection of subclinical PTCs.PATCAM simulates individuals from age 15 until death in birth cohorts starting from 1975 using four inter-related components including natural history, detection, post-diagnosis, and other-cause mortality. PATCAM was built using high-quality data and calibrated against observed age-, sex- and stage-specific incidence in the US as reported by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. PATCAM was validated against US thyroid cancer mortality and three active surveillance studies including the largest and longest running thyroid cancer active surveillance cohort in the world (from Japan) and two from the US.PATCAM successfully replicated age- and stage-specific PTC incidence and mean tumor size at diagnosis and PTC mortality in the US between 1975 and 2015. PATCAM accurately predicted the proportion of tumors that grew more than 3 mm and 5 mm in 5 years and 10 years, aligning with the 95% confidence intervals of the reported rates from active surveillance studies in most cases.","journal":"Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research","reference":"Alagoz O, Zhang Y, Arroyo N, Fernandes-Taylor S, Yang DY, Krebsbach C, Venkatesh M, Hsiao V, Davies L, Francis DO.

Dynamic temporal changes in contact structure and ranging behaviour of wildlife may impact disease dynamics. A consensus has yet to emerge, however, concerning the conditions in which network dynamics impact model outcomes, as compared to static approximations that average contact rates over longer time periods. Furthermore, as many pathogens can be transmitted both environmentally and via close contact, it is important to investigate the relative influence of both transmission routes in real-world populations. Here, we use empirically derived networks from a population of wild primates, Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi), and simulated networks to investigate pathogen spread in dynamic vs. static social networks. First, we constructed a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model of Cryptosporidium spread in wild Verreaux's sifakas. We incorporated social and environmental transmission routes and parameterized the model for two different climatic seasons. Second, we used simulated networks and greater variation in epidemiological parameters to investigate the conditions in which dynamic networks produce larger outbreak sizes than static networks. We found that average outbreak size of Cryptosporidium infections in sifakas was larger when the disease was introduced in the dry season than in the wet season, driven by an increase in home range overlap towards the end of the dry season. Regardless of season, dynamic networks always produced larger average outbreak sizes than static networks. Larger outbreaks in dynamic models based on simulated networks occurred especially when the probability of transmission and recovery were low. Variation in tie strength in the dynamic networks also had a major impact on outbreak size, while network modularity had a weaker influence than epidemiological parameters that determine transmission and recovery. Our study adds to emerging evidence that dynamic networks can change predictions of disease dynamics, especially if the disease shows low transmissibility and a long infectious period, and when environmental conditions lead to enhanced between-group contact after an infectious agent has been introduced.","journal":"The Journal of animal ecology","reference":"Springer A, Kappeler PM, Nunn CL.

Evaluation of probabilistic forecasts is based on proper scoring rules, along with interval coverage proportions to assess calibration. The presented work is part of a pre-registered evaluation study.Multi-model approaches can help to improve the performance of epidemiological forecasts. However, while death numbers can be predicted with some success based on current case and hospitalization data, predictability of case numbers remains low beyond quite short time horizons. Additional data sources including sequencing and mobility data, which were not extensively used in the present study, may help to improve performance.We find that many, though not all, models outperform a simple baseline model up to four weeks ahead for the considered targets. Ensemble methods show very good relative performance. The addressed time period is characterized by rather stable non-pharmaceutical interventions in both countries, making short-term predictions more straightforward than in previous periods. However, major trend changes in reported cases, like the rebound in cases due to the rise of the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant in March 2021, prove challenging to predict.During the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a strong interest in forecasts of the short-term development of epidemiological indicators to inform decision makers.

The objective was to assess projected health and economic outcomes associated with IIV4\u00a0versus IIV3 for preventing seasonal influenza in the US. A cost-effectiveness model was developed to interact with a dynamic transmission model. The transmission model tracked vaccination, influenza cases, infection-spreading interactions, and recovery over 10 y (2012-2022). The cost-effectiveness model estimated influenza-related complications, direct and indirect costs (2013-2014 US$), health outcomes, and cost-effectiveness. Inputs were taken from published\/public sources or estimated using regression or calibration. Outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. Scenario analyses tested the reliability of the results. Seasonal vaccination with IIV4 versus IIV3 is predicted to reduce annual influenza cases by 1,973,849 (discounted; 2,325,644 undiscounted), resulting in 12-13% fewer cases and influenza-related complications and deaths. These reductions are predicted to translate into 18,485 more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) accrued annually for IIV4\u00a0versus IIV3. Increased vaccine-related costs ($599 million; 5.7%) are predicted to be more than offset by reduced influenza treatment costs ($699 million; 12.2%), resulting in direct medical cost saving annually ($100 million; 0.6%). Including indirect costs, savings with IIV4 are predicted to be $7.1 billion (5.6%).

HMIS incidence measures with denominators weighted by probability of attendance were closer to cohort incidence, but remained underestimates (1.1 cases PPY in Kihihi and 1.4 cases PPY in Nagongera).Outpatient data from two public health facilities in Uganda (Kihihi and Nagongera) over a 3-year period (2011-2014) were used to model the relationship between travel time from patient village of residence (available for each individual) to the facility and the relative probability of attendance using Poisson generalized additive models. Outputs from the model were used to generate a weighted population denominator for each health facility and estimate malaria incidence. Among children aged 6\u00a0months to 11\u00a0years, monthly HMIS-derived incidence estimates, with and without population denominators weighted by probability of attendance, were compared with gold standard measures of malaria incidence measured in prospective cohorts.Accurate measures of malaria incidence are essential to track progress and target high-risk populations. While health management information system (HMIS) data provide counts of malaria cases, quantifying the denominator for incidence using these data is challenging because catchment areas and care-seeking behaviours are not well defined. This study's aim was to estimate malaria incidence using HMIS data by adjusting the population denominator accounting for travel time to the health facility.Although malaria incidence measured using HMIS underestimated incidence measured in cohorts, even when adjusting for probability of attendance, HMIS surveillance data are a promising and scalable source for tracking relative changes in malaria incidence over time, particularly when the population denominator can be estimated by incorporating information on village of residence.","journal":"Malaria journal","reference":"Epstein A, Namuganga JF, Kamya EV, Nankabirwa JI, Bhatt S, Rodriguez-Barraquer I, Staedke SG, Kamya MR, Dorsey G, Greenhouse B.

To directly link mechanistic biological processes and evolutionary dynamics during HIV infection, we developed multiple within-host phylodynamic models of HIV primary infection for comparative validation against viral load and evolutionary dynamics data. The optimal model of primary infection required no positive selection, suggesting that the host adaptive immune system reduces viral load but surprisingly does not drive observed viral evolution. Rather, the fitness (infectivity) of mutant variants is drawn from an exponential distribution in which most variants are slightly less infectious than their parents (nearly neutral evolution). This distribution was not largely different from either in\u00a0vivo fitness distributions recorded beyond primary infection or in\u00a0vitro distributions that are observed without adaptive immunity, suggesting the intrinsic viral fitness distribution may drive evolution.

The best available spatio-temporal data on pathogen spread often take the form of human disease surveillance data. By applying a classic ecological approach-occupancy modelling-to an epidemiological question of disease spread, we used surveillance data to examine the latent ecological invasion of tick-borne pathogens. Over the last half-century, previously undescribed tick-borne pathogens including the agents of Lyme disease and human babesiosis have rapidly spread across the northeast United States. Despite their epidemiological importance, the mechanisms of tick-borne pathogen invasion and drivers underlying the distinct invasion trajectories of the co-vectored pathogens remain unresolved. Our approach allowed us to estimate the unobserved ecological processes underlying pathogen spread while accounting for imperfect detection of human cases. Our model predicts that tick-borne diseases spread in a diffusion-like manner with occasional long-distance dispersal and that babesiosis spread exhibits strong dependence on Lyme disease.","journal":"Proceedings.

To mitigate spread, healthcare systems have been cohorting patients to limit contacts between uninfected patients and potentially infected patients or healthcare workers (HCWs). A major challenge in managing the pandemic is the presence of currently asymptomatic\/presymptomatic individuals capable of transmitting the virus, who could introduce COVID-19 into uninfected cohorts. The optimal combination of personal protective equipment (PPE), testing and other approaches to prevent these events is unclear, especially in light of ongoing limited resources.Using stochastic simulations with a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered dynamic model, we quantified and compared the impacts of PPE use, patient and HCWs surveillance testing and subcohorting strategies.In the base case without testing or PPE, the healthcare system was rapidly overwhelmed, and became a net contributor to the force of infection. We found that effective use of PPE by both HCWs and patients could prevent this scenario, while random testing of apparently asymptomatic\/presymptomatic individuals on a weekly basis was less effective. We also found that even imperfect use of PPE could provide substantial protection by decreasing the force of infection. Importantly, we found that creating smaller patient\/HCW-interaction subcohorts can provide additional resilience to outbreak development with limited resources.","journal":"BMJ open","reference":"Qiu X, Miller JC, MacFadden DR, Hanage WP.

Here we develop such a system to study and forecast respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV is the most common cause of acute lower respiratory infection and bronchiolitis. Advanced warning of the epidemic timing and volume of RSV patient surges has the potential to reduce well-documented delays of treatment in emergency departments. We use a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model in conjunction with an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) and ten years of regional U.S. specimen data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The data and EAKF are used to optimize the SIR model and i) estimate critical epidemiological parameters over the course of each outbreak and ii) generate retrospective forecasts. The basic reproductive number, R0, is estimated at 3.0 (standard deviation 0.6) across all seasons and locations. The peak magnitude of RSV outbreaks is forecast with nearly 70% accuracy (i.e. nearly 70% of forecasts within 25% of the actual peak), four weeks before the predicted peak.

Enhanced active case finding was associated with a higher case detection rate.Leprosy is caused by infection with Mycobacterium leprae and is characterized by peripheral nerve damage and skin lesions. The disease is classified into paucibacillary (PB) and multibacillary (MB) leprosy.

Leprosy is treatable, but diagnosis, access to treatment and treatment adherence (all necessary to curtail transmission) represent major challenges.

The infectious reservoir was characterized by age and parasite detectability with diagnostics of varying sensitivity over a range of transmission intensities with and without case management and vector control. Mass screen-and-treat drug campaigns were tested for likelihood of achieving elimination.The composition of the infectious reservoir is similar over a range of transmission intensities, and higher intensity settings are biased towards infections in children. Recent ramp-ups in case management and use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) reduce the infectious reservoir and shift the composition towards sub-microscopic infections. Mass campaigns with anti-malarial drugs are highly effective at interrupting transmission if deployed shortly after ITN campaigns.Elimination of malaria can only be achieved through removal of all vectors or complete depletion of the infectious reservoir in humans. Mechanistic models can be built to synthesize diverse observations from the field collected under a variety of conditions and subsequently used to query the infectious reservoir in great detail.Low-density infections comprise a substantial portion of the infectious reservoir. Proper timing of vector control, seasonal variation in transmission intensity and mass drug campaigns allows lingering population immunity to help drive a region towards elimination.","journal":"Malaria journal","reference":"Gerardin J, Ou\u00e9draogo AL, McCarthy KA, Eckhoff PA, Wenger EA.

However, rotavirus vaccine coverage has remained relatively low (70-75%) compared to other infant immunizations in the U.S. Part of the reason for this lower coverage is that children whose care is provided by family practitioners (FP) have considerably lower probability of being vaccinated compared to those seen be pediatricians (PE). We used a dynamic transmission model to assess the impact of improving rotavirus vaccine coverage by FP and\/or PE on rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) incidence and seasonal patterns.A deterministic age-structured dynamic model with susceptible, infectious, and recovered compartments (SIRS model) was used to simulate rotavirus transmission and vaccination. We estimated the reduction of RVGE cases by 2 doses of rotavirus vaccine with three vaccination scenarios: (Status Quo: 85% coverage by pediatricians and 45% coverage by family practitioners; Improved FP: 85% coverage by pediatricians and family practitioners; Improved FP+PE: 95% coverage by pediatricians and family practitioners). In addition, we tested the sensitivity of the model to the assumption of random mixing patterns between children visiting pediatricians and children visiting family practitioners.In this model, higher vaccine coverage provided by family practitioners and pediatricians leads to lower incidence of severe RVGE cases (23% averted in Improved FP and 57% averted in Improved FP+PE compared to Status Quo) including indirect effects. One critical impact of higher total vaccine coverage is the effect on rotavirus epidemic patterns in the U.S.; the biennial rotavirus epidemic patterns shifted to reduced annual epidemic patterns. Additionally, assortative mixing patterns in children visiting pediatricians and family practitioners amplify the impact of increasing vaccine coverage.Other high-income countries that introduced vaccine have not experienced biennial patterns, like the U.S. Our results suggest that increasing overall vaccine coverage to 85% among infants would lead to an overall reduction in incidence with annual epidemic patterns.","journal":"PloS one","reference":"Ai CE, Steele M, Lopman B.

A multifaceted strategy that combines all three, alongside continued hygiene and distancing protocols, is likely to be the most robust means of controlling transmission of SARS-CoV-2.We find that the relative impact of masks is greatest when testing and tracing rates are lower and vice versa. Scenarios with very high testing rates (90% of people with symptoms, plus 90% of people with a known history of contact with a confirmed case) were estimated to lead to a robustly controlled epidemic. However, across comparable levels of mask uptake and contact tracing, the number of infections over this period was projected to be 2-3 times higher if the testing rate was 80% instead of 90%, 8-12 times higher if the testing rate was 65% or 30-50 times higher with a 50% testing rate. In reality, NSW diagnosed 254 locally acquired cases over this period, an outcome that had a moderate probability in the model (10%-18%) assuming low mask uptake (0%-25%), even in the presence of extremely high testing (90%) and near-perfect community contact tracing (75%-100%), and a considerably higher probability if testing or tracing were at lower levels.None (simulation study).The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic illustrated that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, has the potential to spread exponentially.

It is caused by parasitic flukes that spread through contamination of local water sources. Traditional control focuses on mass drug administration, which kills the majority of adult worms, targeted at school-aged children. However, these drugs do not confer long-term protection and there are concerns over the emergence of drug resistance. The development of a vaccine against schistosomiasis opens the potential for control methods that could generate long-lasting population-level immunity if they are cost-effective.We found that sufficiently low-priced vaccines can be more cost-effective than traditional drugs in high prevalence settings, and can lead to a greater reduction in morbidity over shorter time-scales. MDA or vaccination programmes that target the whole community generate the most health benefits, but are generally less cost-effective than those targeting children, due to lower prevalence of schistosomiasis in adults.The ultimate cost-effectiveness of vaccination will be highly dependent on multiple vaccine characteristics, such as the efficacy, cost, safety and duration of protection, as well as the subset of population targeted for vaccination. However, our results indicate that if a vaccine could be developed with reasonable characteristics and for a sufficiently low cost, then vaccination programmes can be a highly cost-effective method of controlling schistosomiasis in high-transmission areas. The population-level immunity generated by vaccination will also inevitably improve the chances of interrupting transmission of the disease, which is the long-term epidemiological goal.Using an individual-based transmission model, matched to epidemiological data, we compared the cost-effectiveness of a range of vaccination programmes against mass drug administration, across three transmission settings. Health benefit was measured by calculating the heavy-intensity infection years averted by each intervention, while vaccine costs were assessed against robust estimates for the costs of mass drug administration obtained from data. We also calculated a critical vaccination cost, a cost beyond which vaccination might not be economically favorable, by benchmarking the cost-effectiveness of potential vaccines against the cost-effectiveness of mass drug administration, and examined the effect of different vaccine protection durations.","journal":"Parasites & vectors","reference":"Collyer BS, Turner HC, Hollingsworth TD, Keeling MJ.

Empirical individual contact data provide unprecedented information to characterize such heterogeneity and are increasingly available, but are usually collected over a limited period, and can suffer from observation bias. We propose an algorithm to stochastically reconstruct realistic temporal networks from individual contact data in healthcare settings (HCS) and test this approach using real data previously collected in a long-term care facility (LTCF). Our algorithm generates full networks from recorded close-proximity interactions, using hourly inter-individual contact rates and information on individuals' wards, the categories of staff involved in contacts, and the frequency of recurring contacts. It also provides data augmentation by reconstructing contacts for days when some individuals are present in the HCS without having contacts recorded in the empirical data. Recording bias is formalized through an observation model, to allow direct comparison between the augmented and observed networks. We validate our algorithm using data collected during the i-Bird study, and compare the empirical and reconstructed networks. The algorithm was substantially more accurate to reproduce network characteristics than random graphs. The reconstructed networks reproduced well the assortativity by ward (first-third quartiles observed: 0.54-0.64; synthetic: 0.52-0.64) and the hourly staff and patient contact patterns. Importantly, the observed temporal correlation was also well reproduced (0.39-0.50 vs 0.37-0.44), indicating that our algorithm could recreate a realistic temporal structure. The algorithm consistently recreated unobserved contacts to generate full reconstructed networks for the LTCF. To conclude, we propose an approach to generate realistic temporal contact networks and reconstruct unobserved contacts from summary statistics computed using individual-level interaction networks. This could be applied and extended to generate contact networks to other HCS using limited empirical data, to subsequently inform individual-based epidemic models.","journal":"PLoS computational biology","reference":"Duval A, Leclerc QJ, Guillemot D, Temime L, Opatowski L.

Certain serotype pairs are more likely to occur on the same genetic background as a results of serotype switching, but the drivers of these patterns are not well understood.A number of serotype pairs co-occurred on the same genetic lineage more commonly than expected. Co-occurrence of between-serogroup pairs was more common when both serotypes had glucose as a component of the capsule (and, potentially, glucuronic acid, any-N-acetylated sugar or ribitol). Diversity also varied markedly by serotype and was associated with the presence of specific sugars in the capsule.","journal":"The Journal of infectious diseases","reference":"Joshi SS, Al-Mamun MA, Weinberger DM.

The app is intended to enhance vector surveillance activities by giving inspectors the opportunity to incorporate the infestation risk information into their surveillance activities, but it does not dictate which houses to surveil. Therefore, a critical question becomes, will inspectors use the risk information? To answer this question, we ran a pilot study in which we compared surveillance using the app to the current practice (paper maps). We hypothesized that inspectors would use the risk information provided by the app, as measured by the frequency of higher risk houses visited, and qualitative analyses of inspector movement patterns in the field. We also compared the efficiency of both mediums to identify factors that might discourage risk information use. Over the course of ten days (five with each medium), 1,081 houses were visited using the paper maps, of which 366 (34%) were inspected, while 1,038 houses were visited using the app, with 401 (39%) inspected. Five out of eight inspectors (62.5%) visited more higher risk houses when using the app (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.001). Among all inspectors, there was an upward shift in proportional visits to higher risk houses when using the app (Mantel-Haenszel test, common odds ratio (OR) = 2.42, 95% CI 2.00-2.92), and in a second analysis using generalized linear mixed models, app use increased the odds of visiting a higher risk house 2.73-fold (95% CI 2.24-3.32), suggesting that the risk information provided by the app was used by most inspectors. Qualitative analyses of inspector movement revealed indications of risk information use in seven out of eight (87.5%) inspectors. There was no difference between the app and paper maps in the number of houses visited (paired t-test, p = 0.67) or inspected (p = 0.17), suggesting that app use did not reduce surveillance efficiency.Until recently, the Chagas disease vector, Triatoma infestans, was widespread in Arequipa, Per\u00fa, but as a result of a decades-long campaign in which over 70,000 houses were treated with insecticides, infestation prevalence is now greatly reduced. To monitor for T. infestans resurgence, the city is currently in a surveillance phase in which a sample of houses is selected for inspection each year. Despite extensive data from the control campaign that could be used to inform surveillance, the selection of houses to inspect is often carried out haphazardly or by convenience. Therefore, we asked, how can we enhance efforts toward preventing T. infestans resurgence by creating the opportunity for vector surveillance to be informed by data?Without staying vigilant to remaining and re-emerging vector foci following a vector control campaign, disease transmission eventually returns and progress achieved is reversed. Our results suggest that, when provided the opportunity, most inspectors will use risk information to direct their surveillance activities, at least over the short term. The study is an initial, but key, step toward evidence-based vector surveillance.","journal":"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","reference":"Gutfraind A, Peterson JK, Billig Rose E, Arevalo-Nieto C, Sheen J, Condori-Luna GF, Tankasala N, Castillo-Neyra R, Condori-Pino C, Anand P, Naquira-Velarde C, Levy MZ.

We extended a previously described model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to incorporate vaccination and multi-strain dynamics to explicitly capture the emergence of the delta variant. We calibrated the model to English surveillance data, including hospital admissions, hospital occupancy, seroprevalence data, and population-level PCR testing data using a Bayesian evidence synthesis framework, then modelled the potential trajectory of the epidemic for a range of different schedules for relaxing NPIs. We estimated the resulting number of daily infections and hospital admissions, and daily and cumulative deaths. Three scenarios spanning a range of optimistic to pessimistic vaccine effectiveness, waning natural immunity, and cross-protection from previous infections were investigated. We also considered three levels of mixing after the lifting of restrictions.Our findings show that the risk of a large wave of COVID-19 hospital admissions resulting from lifting NPIs can be substantially mitigated if the timing of NPI relaxation is carefully balanced against vaccination coverage. However, with the delta variant, it might not be possible to fully lift NPIs without a third wave of hospital admissions and deaths, even if vaccination coverage is high. Variants of concern, their transmissibility, vaccine uptake, and vaccine effectiveness must be carefully monitored as countries relax pandemic control measures.The roadmap policy was successful in offsetting the increased transmission resulting from lifting NPIs starting on March 8, 2021, with increasing population immunity through vaccination. However, because of the emergence of the delta variant, with an estimated transmission advantage of 76% (95% credible interval [95% CrI] 69-83) over alpha, fully lifting NPIs on June 21, 2021, as originally planned might have led to 3900 (95% CrI 1500-5700) peak daily hospital admissions under our central parameter scenario.

We calibrated these models using prevalence data from Maputo, Mozambique and estimates of attributable fraction of transmission pathways for the region. We simulated the prevalence of human infection after reducing transmission through each pathway.The burden of diarrheal diseases remains high among children in low-income countries. Enteropathogens are challenging to control because they are transmitted via multiple pathways. Chickens are an important animal protein source, but live chickens and their products are often highly contaminated with enteropathogens.Our transmission models showed that the foodborne transmission has to be reduced to control enteropathogen infections in our study site, and likely in other similar contexts, but mitigation of this transmission pathway has not received sufficient attention.

While some symptoms may be transmission-enhancing, other symptoms are likely to reduce transmission potential. For human diseases, the reduction in transmission opportunities is commonly caused by reduced activity. There is limited data regarding the potential impact of virulence on transmission potential. We performed an exploratory data analysis of 324 influenza patients at a university health centre during the 2016\/2017 influenza season. We classified symptoms as infectiousness-related or morbidity-related and calculated two scores. The scores were used to explore the relationship between infectiousness, morbidity (virulence), and activity level. We found a decrease in the activity level with increasing morbidity scores. There was no consistent pattern between an activity level and an infectiousness score. We also found a positive correlation between morbidity and infectiousness scores. Overall, we find that increasing virulence leads to increased infectiousness and reduced activity, suggesting a trade-off that can impact overall transmission potential. Our findings indicate that a reduction of systemic symptoms may increase host activity without reducing infectiousness. Therefore, interventions should target both systemic- and infectiousness-related symptoms to reduce overall transmission potential. Our findings can also inform simulation models that investigate the impact of different interventions on transmission.","journal":"Proceedings.

The foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Uruguay displayed a profile of slower growth while the growth pattern of the HIV\/AIDS epidemic in Japan was approximately linear. The West African Ebola epidemic provided a unique opportunity to explore how growth profiles vary by geography; analysis of the largest district-level outbreaks revealed substantial growth variations (mean p=0.59, range: 0.14-0.97). The districts of Margibi in Liberia and Bombali and Bo in Sierra Leone had near-exponential growth, while the districts of Bomi in Liberia and Kenema in Sierra Leone displayed near constant incidences.We introduce a 2-parameter generalized-growth model to characterize the ascending phase of an outbreak and capture epidemic profiles ranging from sub-exponential to exponential growth. We test the model against empirical outbreak data representing a variety of viral pathogens in historic and contemporary populations, and provide simulations highlighting the importance of sub-exponential growth for forecasting purposes.Our findings reveal significant variation in epidemic growth patterns across different infectious disease outbreaks and highlights that sub-exponential growth is a common phenomenon, especially for pathogens that are not airborne. Sub-exponential growth profiles may result from heterogeneity in contact structures or risk groups, reactive behavior changes, or the early onset of interventions strategies, and consideration of \"deceleration parameters\" may be useful to refine existing mathematical transmission models and improve disease forecasts.A better characterization of the early growth dynamics of an epidemic is needed to dissect the important drivers of disease transmission, refine existing transmission models, and improve disease forecasts.","journal":"Epidemics","reference":"Viboud C, Simonsen L, Chowell G.

To support proactive decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic, mathematical models have been leveraged to identify surveillance indicator thresholds at which strengthening nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is necessary to protect health care capacity. Understanding tradeoffs between different adaptive COVID-19 response components is important when designing strategies that balance public preference and public health goals. Methods. We considered 3 components of an adaptive COVID-19 response: 1) the threshold at which to implement the NPI, 2) the time needed to implement the NPI, and 3) the effectiveness of the NPI. Using a compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission calibrated to Minnesota state data, we evaluated different adaptive policies in terms of the peak number of hospitalizations and the time spent with the NPI in force. Scenarios were compared with a reference strategy, in which an NPI with an 80% contact reduction was triggered when new weekly hospitalizations surpassed 8 per 100,000 population, with a 7-day implementation period. Assumptions were varied in sensitivity analysis. Results. All adaptive response scenarios substantially reduced peak hospitalizations relative to no response. Among adaptive response scenarios, slower NPI implementation resulted in somewhat higher peak hospitalization and a longer time spent under the NPIs than the reference scenario. A stronger NPI response resulted in slightly less time with the NPIs in place and smaller hospitalization peak. A higher trigger threshold resulted in greater peak hospitalizations with little reduction in the length of time under the NPIs. Conclusions. An adaptive NPI response can substantially reduce infection circulation and prevent health care capacity from being exceeded. However, population preferences as well as the feasibility and timeliness of compliance with reenacting NPIs should inform response design.","journal":"MDM policy & practice","reference":"Sanstead EC, Li Z, McKearnan SB, Kao SZ, Mink PJ, Simon AB, Kuntz KM, Gildemeister S, Enns EA.

It causes substantial economic burdens to individual growers, citrus industries and governments. Successful management strategies to reduce disease burden are desperately needed but with so many possible interventions and combinations thereof it is difficult to know which are worthwhile or cost-effective. We review how mathematical models have yielded useful insights into controlling disease spread for other vector-borne plant diseases, and the small number of mathematical models of HLB. We adapt a malaria model to HLB, by including temperature-dependent psyllid traits, \"flushing\" of trees, and economic costs, to show how models can be used to highlight the parameters that require more data collection or that should be targeted for intervention. We analyze the most common intervention strategy, insecticide spraying, to determine the most cost-effective spraying strategy. We find that fecundity and feeding rate of the vector require more experimental data collection, for wider temperatures ranges. Also, the best strategy for insecticide intervention is to spray for more days rather than pay extra for a more efficient spray. We conclude that mathematical models are able to provide useful recommendations for managing HLB spread.","journal":"PeerJ","reference":"Taylor RA, Mordecai EA, Gilligan CA, Rohr JR, Johnson LR.

Sentinel surveillance triggered fewer false alarms and averted more deaths per day spent in mitigation. When transmission increase in older populations lagged the increase in younger populations by 14 days, sentinel surveillance extended its lead time over hospital admissions by an additional 2 days.We used a stochastic, compartmental transmission model to evaluate the performance of various surveillance indicators at reliably triggering an alarm in response to, but not before, a step increase in transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The surveillance indicators included hospital admissions, hospital occupancy, and sentinel cases with varying levels of sampling effort capturing 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100% of incident mild cases. We tested 3 levels of transmission increase, 3 population sizes, and conditions of either simultaneous transmission increase or lagged increase in the older population. We compared the indicators' performance at triggering alarm soon after, but not prior, to the transmission increase.Sentinel surveillance of mild symptomatic cases can provide more timely and reliable information on changes in transmission to inform decision-makers in an epidemic like COVID-19.Decision-makers impose COVID-19 mitigations based on public health indicators such as reported cases, which are sensitive to fluctuations in supply and demand for diagnostic testing, and hospital admissions, which lag infections by up to two weeks. Imposing mitigations too early has unnecessary economic costs while imposing too late leads to uncontrolled epidemics with unnecessary cases and deaths. Sentinel surveillance of recently-symptomatic individuals in outpatient testing sites may overcome biases and lags in conventional indicators, but the minimal outpatient sentinel surveillance system needed for reliable trend estimation remains unknown.","journal":"BMC infectious diseases","reference":"Toh KB, Runge M, Richardson RA, Hladish TJ, Gerardin J.

Here, we study the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, mortality, and economic output between January 2020 and December 2022 across 25 European countries.The interplay between transmission intensity, excess deaths, population mobility and economic output is highly complex, and none of these factors can be considered in isolation. Our results reinforce the intuitive idea that significant economic activity arises from diverse person-to-person interactions. Our analysis quantifies and highlights that the impact of disease on a given country is complex and multifaceted. Long-term economic impairments are not fully captured by our model, as well as long-term disease effects (Long COVID).Disease transmission intensity (logRt) decreases GDP and increases excess deaths, where the latter association is longer-lasting. Changes in GDP as well as prior week transmission intensity are both negatively associated with each other (-0.241, 95% CrI: -0.295 - -0.189). We find evidence of risk-averse behaviour, as changes in transit and prior week transmission intensity are negatively associated (-0.055, 95% CrI: -0.074 to -0.036). Our results highlight a complex cost-benefit trade-off from individual NPIs.

Models have focused primarily on the reproductive numbers of the disease that represent the average number of secondary infections produced by a random infectious individual. However, these population-level estimates may conflate important systematic variation in the number of cases generated by infected individuals, particularly found in spatially localized transmission and superspreading events. Although superspreading features prominently in first-hand narratives of Ebola transmission, its dynamics have not been systematically characterized, hindering refinements of future epidemic predictions and explorations of targeted interventions. We used Bayesian model inference to integrate individual-level spatial information with other epidemiological data of community-based (undetected within clinical-care systems) cases and to explicitly infer distribution of the cases generated by each infected individual. Our results show that superspreaders play a key role in sustaining onward transmission of the epidemic, and they are responsible for a significant proportion ([Formula: see text]61%) of the infections. Our results also suggest age as a key demographic predictor for superspreading. We also show that community-based cases may have progressed more rapidly than those notified within clinical-care systems, and most transmission events occurred in a relatively short distance (with median value of 2.51 km). Our results stress the importance of characterizing superspreading of Ebola, enhance our current understanding of its spatiotemporal dynamics, and highlight the potential importance of targeted control measures.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","reference":"Lau MS, Dalziel BD, Funk S, McClelland A, Tiffany A, Riley S, Metcalf CJ, Grenfell BT.

Uptake of each intervention was interdependent: maximal use of the adherence and persistence interventions depended on new PrEP users generated by the initiation intervention. As the budget increased, optimal investment involved a mixture of the initiation and persistence interventions, but not the adherence intervention. If adherence intervention costs were halved, the optimal investment was roughly equal across interventions.Investments into the PrEP cascade through initiatives should account for the interactions of the interventions as they are collectively deployed. Given current intervention efficacy estimates, the total population impact of each intervention may be improved with greater total budgets or reduced intervention costs.The model simulated MSM participating in up to three real-world PrEP cascade interventions designed to improve initiation, adherence, or persistence.

The population-level impact of this strategy is unclear and will vary across the country.We constructed a static linear model to estimate the optimal ages and incremental impact of adding one-time routine HIV screening to risk-based, prenatal, symptom-based, and partner notification testing. Using surveillance data and published studies, we parameterized the model at the national level and for two settings representing subnational variability in the rates and distribution of infection: King County, WA and Philadelphia County, PA. Screening strategies were evaluated in terms of the percent of tests that result in new diagnoses (test positivity), cumulative person-years of undiagnosed infection, and the number of symptomatic HIV\/AIDS cases.While routine HIV screening may contribute meaningfully to increased case detection in persons not captured by targeted testing programs in some settings, this strategy will have a limited impact on population-level outcomes. Our findings highlight the importance of a multipronged testing strategy with continued investment in risk-based screening programs.Depending on the frequency of risk-based screening, routine screening test positivity was maximized at ages 30-34 years in the national model. The optimal age for routine screening was higher in a setting with a lower proportion of cases among men who have sex with men.

In the event of an insult where the body is exposed to inflammation triggering moieties (ITMs), neutrophils are mobilized towards the site of insult and antagonize the inflammation. If the inflammation is cleared, neutrophils go into a programmed death called apoptosis. However, if the insult is intense or persistent, neutrophils take on a violent death pathway called necrosis, which involves the rupture of their cytoplasmic content into the surrounding tissue that causes local tissue damage, thus further aggravating inflammation. This seemingly paradoxical phenomenon fuels the inflammatory process by triggering the recruitment of additional neutrophils to the site of inflammation, aimed to contribute to the complete neutralization of severe inflammation. This delicate balance between the cost and benefit of the neutrophils' choice of death pathway has been optimized during the evolution of the innate immune system. The goal of our work is to understand how the tradeoff between the cost and benefit of the different death pathways of neutrophils, in response to various levels of insults, has been optimized over evolutionary time by using the concepts of evolutionary game theory.By adopting an evolutionary perspective, we identify the driving mechanisms leading to the delicate balance between apoptosis and necrosis in neutrophils' cell death in response to different insults. Using our simple model, we verify that indeed, the global cost of remaining ITMs is the driving mechanism that reproduces the percentage of necrosis and apoptosis observed in data and neutrophils need sufficient information of the overall inflammation to be able to pick a death pathway that presumably increases the survival of the organism.We show that by using evolutionary game theory, we are able to formulate a game that predicts the percentage of necrosis and apoptosis when exposed to various levels of insults.","journal":"BMC bioinformatics","reference":"Presbitero A, Mancini E, Castiglione F, Krzhizhanovskaya VV, Quax R.

Here we ask how dynamic territory formation and maintenance might contribute to disease dynamics in a territorial, solitary predator for an indirectly transmitted pathogen. We developed a mechanistic individual-based model where stigmergy-the deposition of signals into the environment (e.g., scent marking, scraping)-dictates local movement choices and long-term territory formation, but also the risk of pathogen transmission. Based on a variable importance analysis, the length of the infectious period was the single most important variable in predicting outbreak success, maximum prevalence, and outbreak duration. Host density and rate of pathogen decay were also key predictors. We found that territoriality best reduced maximum prevalence in conditions where we would otherwise expect outbreaks to be most successful: slower recovery rates (i.e., longer infectious periods) and higher conspecific densities. However, for slower pathogen decay rates, stigmergy-driven movement increased outbreak durations relative to random movement simulations. Our findings therefore support a limited version of the \"territoriality benefits\" hypothesis-where reduced home range overlap leads to reduced opportunities for pathogen transmission, but with the caveat that reduction in outbreak severity may increase the likelihood of pathogen persistence. For longer infectious periods and higher host densities, key trade-offs emerged between the strength of pathogen load, the strength of the stigmergy cue, and the rate at which those two quantities decayed; this finding raises interesting questions about the evolutionary nature of these competing processes and the role of possible feedbacks between parasitism and territoriality. This work also highlights the importance of considering social cues as part of the movement landscape in order to better understand the consequences of individual behaviors on population level outcomes.","journal":"PLoS computational biology","reference":"White LA, VandeWoude S, Craft ME.

Accurate systems that track influenza activity at the city level are necessary to provide actionable information that can be used for clinical, hospital, and community outbreak preparation.We first tested the ability of Google searches, Twitter posts, electronic health records, and a crowd-sourced influenza reporting system to detect influenza activity in the Boston metropolis separately. We then adapted a multivariate dynamic regression method named ARGO (autoregression with general online information), designed for tracking influenza at the national level, and showed that it effectively uses the above data sources to monitor and forecast influenza at the city level 1 week ahead of the current date. Finally, we presented an ensemble-based approach capable of combining information from models based on multiple data sources to more robustly nowcast as well as forecast influenza activity in the Boston metropolitan area. The performances of our models were evaluated in an out-of-sample fashion over 4 influenza seasons within 2012-2016, as well as a holdout validation period from 2016 to 2017.Although Internet-based real-time data sources such as Google searches and tweets have been successfully used to produce influenza activity estimates ahead of traditional health care-based systems at national and state levels, influenza tracking and forecasting at finer spatial resolutions, such as the city level, remain an open question. Our study aimed to present a precise, near real-time methodology capable of producing influenza estimates ahead of those collected and published by the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) for the Boston metropolitan area. This approach has great potential to be extended to other cities with access to similar data sources.Our ensemble-based methods incorporating information from diverse models based on multiple data sources, including ARGO, produced the most robust and accurate results. The observed Pearson correlations between our out-of-sample flu activity estimates and those historically reported by the BPHC were 0.98 in nowcasting influenza and 0.94 in forecasting influenza 1 week ahead of the current date.","journal":"JMIR public health and surveillance","reference":"Lu FS, Hou S, Baltrusaitis K, Shah M, Leskovec J, Sosic R, Hawkins J, Brownstein J, Conidi G, Gunn J, Gray J, Zink A, Santillana M.

Here we conducted a population-based survey in Tomsk, Russia, asking participants to record all their contacts in physical person during the day. We estimated 9.8 contacts per person per day on average, 15.2 when including additional estimated professional contacts. We found that contacts were highly assortative by age, especially for school-age individuals, and the number of contacts negatively correlated with the age of the participant. The network of contacts was quite clustered, with the majority of contacts (about 72%) occurring between family members, students of the same school\/university, and work colleagues. School represents the location where the largest number of contacts was recorded - students contacted about 7 individuals per day at school. Our modeling analysis based on the recorded contact patterns supports the importance of modeling age-mixing patterns - we show that, in the case of an epidemic caused by a novel influenza virus, school-age individuals would be the most affected age group, followed by adults aged 35-44 years. In conclusion, this study reveals an age-mixing pattern in general agreement with that estimated for European countries, although with several quantitative differences. The observed differences can be attributable to sociodemographic and cultural differences between countries. The age- and setting-specific contact matrices provided in this study could be instrumental for the design of control measures for airborne infections, specifically targeted on the characteristics of the Russian population.","journal":"Journal of theoretical biology","reference":"Ajelli M, Litvinova M.

The basic reproduction number is derived and the existence and local stability of the model equilibria are analyzed. When the force of infection of each disease is unaffected by the presence of the other, we find that there is a conflict of interest between individual and community, known as a tragedy of the commons, under targeted treatment toward persons infected by the single strain disease, but there is no conflict under mass treatment. However, we numerically show that individual and social incentive to use antibiotics may show disaccord under mass treatment if the restriction on the transmission ability of the dually infected people is removed, or drug resistant infection is worse than drug sensitive infection, or the uninfected state has a comparative disutility over the infected states.

This work presents the first systematic study to understand the dynamics of adoption of CIM knee implants and instrumentation. More broadly, the current modeling approach and systems thinking perspective could be used to consider the adoption of any emerging customized therapies for personalized medicine.A system dynamics simulation model was developed to study adoption dynamics of CIM and meet the research objectives. The model reproduced the historical data on primary and revision knee replacement implants obtained from the literature and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Then the dynamics of adoption of CIM implants were simulated from 2018 to 2026. The rate of 90-day readmission, 3-year revision surgery, recovery period, time savings in operating rooms, and the associated cost within 3 years of primary knee replacement implants were used as performance metrics.The simulation results indicate that by 2026, an adoption rate of 90% for CIM implants can reduce the number of readmissions and revision surgeries by 62% and 39%, respectively, and can save hospitals and surgeons 6% on procedure time and cut down cumulative healthcare costs by approximately $38 billion.","journal":"Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research","reference":"Namin AT, Jalali MS, Vahdat V, Bedair HS, O'Connor MI, Kamarthi S, Isaacs JA.

{"id":"6db6e334e80ef76453cc967131e22f82","title":"When to be temperate: on the fitness benefits of lysis vs. lysogeny.","abstract":"Bacterial viruses, that is 'bacteriophage' or 'phage', can infect and lyse their bacterial hosts, releasing new viral progeny. In addition to the lytic pathway, certain bacteriophage (i.e. 'temperate' bacteriophage) can also initiate lysogeny, a latent mode of infection in which the viral genome is integrated into and replicated with the bacterial chromosome. Subsequently, the integrated viral genome, that is the 'prophage', can induce and restart the lytic pathway. Here, we explore the relationship among infection mode, ecological context, and viral fitness, in essence asking: when should viruses be temperate? To do so, we use network loop analysis to quantify fitness in terms of network paths through the life history of an infectious pathogen that start and end with infected cells. This analysis reveals that temperate strategies, particularly those with direct benefits to cellular fitness, should be favored at low host abundances. This finding applies to a spectrum of mechanistic models of phage-bacteria dynamics spanning both explicit and implicit representations of intra-cellular infection dynamics. However, the same analysis reveals that temperate strategies, in and of themselves, do not provide an advantage when infection imposes a cost to cellular fitness. Hence, we use evolutionary invasion analysis to explore when temperate phage can invade microbial communities with circulating lytic phage. We find that lytic phage can drive down niche competition amongst microbial cells, facilitating the subsequent invasion of latent strategies that increase cellular resistance and\/or immunity to infection by lytic viruses-notably this finding holds even when the prophage comes at a direct fitness cost to cellular reproduction. Altogether, our analysis identifies broad ecological conditions that favor latency and provide a principled framework for exploring the impacts of ecological context on both the short- and long-term benefits of being temperate.","journal":"Virus evolution","reference":"Li G, Cortez MH, Dushoff J, Weitz JS.

Obstacles in mosquito MRR protocols include marking limitations due to small individual size, short lifespan, low efficiency in capturing devices such as traps, and individual removal upon capture. These limitations usually make MRR analysis restricted to only abundance estimation or a combination of abundance and survivorship, and often generate a great degree of uncertainty about the estimations.We present a set of Bayesian biodemographic models designed to fit data from most common mosquito recapture experiments. Using both field data and simulations, we consider model features such as capture efficiency, survival rates, removal of individuals due to capturing, and collection of pupae. These models permit estimation of abundance, survivorship of both marked and unmarked mosquitoes, if different, and recruitment rate. We analyze the accuracy of estimates by varying the number of released individuals, abundance, survivorship, and capture efficiency in multiple simulations. These methods can stand capture efficiencies as low as usually reported but their accuracy depends on the number of released mosquitoes, abundance and survivorship. We also show that gathering pupal counts allows estimating differences in survivorship between released mosquitoes and the unmarked population.","journal":"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","reference":"Villela DAM, Garcia GA, Maciel-de-Freitas R.

While national tuberculosis programs maintain notification registers which represent a potential source of data to investigate transmission patterns, high local tuberculosis incidence may not provide a reliable signal for transmission because the population distribution of covariates affecting susceptibility and disease progression may confound the relationship between tuberculosis incidence and transmission. Child cases of tuberculosis and other endemic infectious disease have been observed to provide a signal of their transmission intensity. We assessed whether local overrepresentation of child cases in tuberculosis notification data corresponds to areas where recent transmission events are concentrated.Age-disaggregated notification data can be used to identify hotspots of tuberculosis transmission and suggest local force of infection, providing an easily accessible source of data to target active case-finding intervention.Areas in which childhood tuberculosis cases are overrepresented align with areas of spatial concentration of transmission revealed by molecular epidemiologic methods.We visualized spatial clustering of children <\u20095\u2009years old notified to Peru's National Tuberculosis Program from two districts of Lima, Peru, from 2005 to 2007 using a log-Gaussian Cox process to model the intensity of the point-referenced child cases. To identify where clustering of child cases was more extreme than expected by chance alone, we mapped all cases from the notification data onto a grid and used a hierarchical Bayesian spatial model to identify grid cells where the proportion of cases among children <\u20095\u2009years old is greater than expected. Modeling the proportion of child cases allowed us to use the spatial distribution of adult cases to control for unobserved factors that may explain the spatial variability in the distribution of child cases. We compare where young children are overrepresented in case notification data to areas identified as transmission hotspots using molecular epidemiological methods during a prospective study of tuberculosis transmission conducted from 2009 to 2012 in the same setting.","journal":"BMC medicine","reference":"Gunasekera KS, Zelner J, Becerra MC, Contreras C, Franke MF, Lecca L, Murray MB, Warren JL, Cohen T.

A first step in analyzing WGS data is usually to define \"transmission clusters,\" sets of cases that are potentially linked by direct transmission. This is often done by including two cases in the same cluster if they are separated by fewer single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) than a specified threshold. However, there is little agreement as to what an appropriate threshold should be. We propose a probabilistic alternative, suggesting that the key inferential target for transmission clusters is the number of transmissions separating cases. We characterize this by combining the number of SNP differences and the length of time over which those differences have accumulated, using information about case timing, molecular clock, and transmission processes. Our framework has the advantage of allowing for variable mutation rates across the genome and can incorporate other epidemiological data. We use two tuberculosis studies to illustrate the impact of our approach: with British Columbia data by using spatial divisions; with Republic of Moldova data by incorporating antibiotic resistance. Simulation results indicate that our transmission-based method is better in identifying direct transmissions than a SNP threshold, with dissimilarity between clusterings of on average 0.27\u2009bits compared with 0.37\u2009bits for the SNP-threshold method and 0.84\u2009bits for randomly permuted data. These results show that it is likely to outperform the SNP-threshold method where clock rates are variable and sample collection times are spread out. We implement the method in the R package transcluster.","journal":"Molecular biology and evolution","reference":"Stimson J, Gardy J, Mathema B, Crudu V, Cohen T, Colijn C. (2019).

{"id":"cff4ceb2213f9496cf42930bc0277f72","title":"Hidden heterogeneity and its influence on dengue vaccination impact.","abstract":"The CYD-TDV vaccine was recently developed to combat dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease that afflicts millions of people each year throughout the tropical and subtropical world. Its rollout has been complicated by recent findings that vaccinees with no prior exposure to dengue virus (DENV) experience an elevated risk of severe disease in response to their first DENV infection subsequent to vaccination. As a result of these findings, guidelines for use of CYD-TDV now require serological screening prior to vaccination to establish that an individual does not fall into this high-risk category. These complications mean that the public health impact of CYD-TDV vaccination is expected to be higher in areas with higher transmission. One important practical difficulty with tailoring vaccination policy to local transmission contexts is that DENV transmission is spatially heterogeneous, even at the scale of neighborhoods or blocks within a city. This raises the question of whether models based on data that average over spatial heterogeneity in transmission could fail to capture important aspects of CYD-TDV impact in spatially heterogeneous populations. We explored this question with a deterministic model of DENV transmission and CYD-TDV vaccination in a population comprised of two communities with differing transmission intensities. Compared to the full model, a version of the model based on the average of the two communities failed to capture benefits of targeting the intervention to the high-transmission community, which resulted in greater impact in both communities than we observed under even coverage. In addition, the model based on the average of the two communities substantially overestimated impact among vaccinated individuals in the low-transmission community. In the event that the specificity of serological screening is not high, this result suggests that models that ignore spatial heterogeneity could overlook the potential for harm to this segment of the population.","journal":"Infectious Disease Modelling","reference":"Walters M, Perkins TA.

This threshold corresponds to parameters where the system's equilibrium becomes unstable. Consequently, we use the average rate at which deviations from the equilibrium shrink to define a distance to this threshold. However, the vital dynamics of the host population may occur slowly even when transmission is far from threshold levels. Here, we show analytically how such slow dynamics can prevent estimation of the distance to the threshold from fluctuations in the susceptible population. Although these results are exact only in the limit of long-term observation of a large system, simulations show that they still provide useful insight into systems with a range of population sizes, environmental noise and observation schemes. Having established some guidelines about when estimates are accurate, we then illustrate how multiple distance estimates can be used to estimate the rate of approach to the threshold.

Periodic historical outbreaks with significant wildlife losses date to 1950s, but B. anthracis ecological niche in the ecosystem is poorly understood. This study used the Maximum Entropy modeling algorithm method to predict suitable niche and environmental conditions that may support anthrax distribution and spore survival. Model inputs comprised 471 presence-only anthrax occurrence data from park management records of 1956-2010, and 11 predictor variables derived from the World Climatic and Africa Soil Grids online resources, selected considering the ecology of anthrax. The findings revealed predicted suitable niche favoring survival and distribution of anthrax spores as a narrow-restricted corridor within the study area, defined by hot-dry climatic conditions with alkaline soils rich in potassium and calcium. A mean test AUC of 0.94 and predicted probability of 0.93 for anthrax presence were registered.

The analysis was performed from a US Veterans Affairs perspective via retrospectively collected data, over a 5-year model time horizon. Outcome and cost data were used to calculate cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY), and one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. In the base case analysis, capecitabine and capecitabine plus oxaliplatin both cost more and were less effective than other regimens, and 5-FU\/LV plus oxaliplatin, compared to 5-FU\/LV alone, resulted in a cost of $25,997 per QALY gained. Model results were generally robust to parameter variation. Capecitabine plus oxaliplatin could be economically reasonable if full dosing occurred \u226576% of the time (base case 42%). In a real-world setting, the addition of oxaliplatin to 5-FU\/LV is more effective but also more costly than 5-FU\/LV alone.

By studying both conceptual and data-driven models, we show that the integrated consideration of individual risks and societal disruptions under resilience assessment framework provides an insightful picture of how an epidemic might impact society. In particular, containment interventions intended for a straightforward reduction of the risk may have net negative impact on the system by slowing down the recovery of basic societal functions. The presented study operationalizes the resilience framework, providing a more nuanced and comprehensive approach for optimizing containment schemes and mitigation policies in the case of epidemic outbreaks.","journal":"Scientific reports","reference":"Massaro E, Ganin A, Perra N, Linkov I, Vespignani A.

Evidence from cell-phone data.","abstract":"We use a mediation framework, and combine daily weather, COVID-19 hospital surveillance, cellphone-based mobility data and building footprints to estimate the relationship between daily indoor and outdoor weather conditions, mobility, and COVID-19 hospitalizations. We quantify the direct health impacts of weather on COVID-19 hospitalizations and the indirect effects of weather via time spent indoors away-from-home on COVID-19 hospitalizations within five Colorado counties between March 4th 2020 and January 31st 2021.We found evidence that changes in 12-day lagged hospital admissions were primarily via the direct effects of weather conditions, rather than via indirect effects by which weather changes time spent indoors away-from-home. Sensitivity analyses evaluating time at home as a mediator were consistent with these conclusions.We aim to evaluate the extent to which weather impacts COVID-19 via time spent away-from-home in indoor spaces, as compared to a direct effect of weather on COVID-19 hospitalization, independent of mobility.Our findings do not support the hypothesis that weather impacted SARS-CoV-2 transmission via changes in mobility patterns during the first year of the pandemic. Rather, weather appears to have impacted SARS-CoV-2 transmission primarily via mechanisms other than human movement. We recommend further analysis of this phenomenon to determine whether these findings generalize to current SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and other seasonal respiratory pathogens.There is growing evidence that weather alters SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but it remains unclear what drives the phenomenon. One prevailing hypothesis is that people spend more time indoors in cooler weather, leading to increased spread of SARS-CoV-2 related to time spent in confined spaces and close contact with others. However, the evidence in support of that hypothesis is limited and, at times, conflicting.","journal":"medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences","reference":"Grover EN, Buchwald AG, Ghosh D, Carlton EJ.

Although many studies have identified associations between individual-level covariates and pathogen genetic relatedness, few have identified characteristics of transmission pairs or explored how closely covariates associated with genetic relatedness mirror those associated with transmission.We simulated a TB-like outbreak with pathogen genetic data and estimated odds ratios (ORs) to correlate each covariate and genetic relatedness. We used a naive Bayes approach to modify the genetic links and nonlinks to resemble the true links and nonlinks more closely and estimated modified ORs with this approach. We compared these two sets of ORs with the true ORs for transmission. Finally, we applied this method to TB data in Hamburg, Germany, and Massachusetts, USA, to find pair-level covariates associated with transmission.We developed a method to improve the use of genetic relatedness as a proxy for transmission, and aid in understanding TB transmission dynamics in low-burden settings.Using simulations, we found that associations between covariates and genetic relatedness had the same relative magnitudes and directions as the true associations with transmission, but biased absolute magnitudes. Modifying the genetic links and nonlinks reduced the bias and increased the confidence interval widths, more accurately capturing error. In Hamburg and Massachusetts, pairs were more likely to be probable transmission links if they lived in closer proximity, had a shorter time between observations, or had shared ethnicity, social risk factors, drug resistance, or genotypes.","journal":"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)","reference":"Leavitt SV, Horsburgh CR Jr., Lee RS, Tibbs AM, White LF, Jenkins HE.

Behavior pattern sensitivity analysis is a useful and flexible tool for conducting a sensitivity analysis on models with varied output behavior, enabling prioritization of input parameters via regression model selection techniques. Cox proportional hazard models are an alternative to linear regression when behavior pattern measures are censored or linear regression assumptions cannot be met.We have expanded the behavior pattern sensitivity analysis procedure by incorporating model selection techniques to produce parsimonious linear regression models that efficiently prioritize input parameters. We also demonstrate how to address common violations of linear regression model assumptions. Finally, we explore the semi-parametric Cox proportional hazards model as an alternative to linear regression for situations with censored data. In the example mathematical model, the resistant bacteria exhibited three behaviors during the simulation period: (1) increasing, (2) decreasing, and (3) increasing during antimicrobial therapy and decreasing after therapy ceases. The behavior pattern sensitivity analysis identified bacterial population parameters as high importance in determining the trajectory of the resistant bacteria population.Sensitivity analysis is an essential step in mathematical modeling because it identifies parameters with a strong influence on model output, due to natural variation or uncertainty in the parameter values. Recently behavior pattern sensitivity analysis has been suggested as a method for sensitivity analyses on models with more than one mode of output behavior. The model output is classified by behavior mode and several behavior pattern measures, defined by the researcher, are calculated for each behavior mode. Significant associations between model inputs and outputs are identified by building linear regression models with the model parameters as independent variables and the behavior pattern measures as the dependent variables. We applied the behavior pattern sensitivity analysis to a mathematical model of tetracycline-resistant enteric bacteria in beef cattle administered chlortetracycline orally. The model included 29 parameters related to bacterial population dynamics, chlortetracycline pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The prevalence of enteric resistance during and after chlortetracycline administration was the model output. Cox proportional hazard models were used when linear regression assumptions were not met.","journal":"BMC veterinary research","reference":"Cazer CL, Volkova VV, Gr\u00f6hn YT. (2018).

Immunity through vaccination and acquired following recovery from natural infection are the two means to building up population immunity, with vaccination representing the safe pathway. However, measuring the contribution to population immunity from vaccination or natural infection is non-trivial. Historical COVID-19 case counts and vaccine coverage are necessary information but are not sufficient to approximate population immunity. Here, we consider the nuances of measuring each and propose an analytical framework for integrating the necessary data on cumulative vaccinations and natural infections at the state and national level. To guide vaccine roll-out and other aspects of control over the coming months, we recommend analytics that combine vaccine coverage with local (e.g. county-level) history of case reports and adjustment for waning antibodies to establish local estimates of population immunity. To do so, the strategic use of minimally-biased serology surveys integrated with vaccine administration data can improve estimates of the aggregate level of immunity to guide data-driven decisions to re-open safely and prioritize vaccination efforts.","journal":"Annals of epidemiology","reference":"Lopman BA, Shioda K, Nguyen Q, Beckett SJ, Siegler AJ, Sullivan PS, Weitz JS.

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Methods: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January and February 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. Findings: We estimated that the median daily reproduction number, Rt , declined from 2.35 (95% CI: 1.15-4.77) one week before travel restrictions were introduced on 23rd January to 1.05 (95% CI: 0.413-2.39) one week after. Based on our estimates of Rt,we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential as Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. Interpretation: Our results show that COVID-19 transmission likely declined in Wuhan during late January 2020, coinciding with the introduction of control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan pre-control, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but may still cause new outbreaks eventually. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust (grants 206250\/Z\/17\/Z and 210758\/Z\/18\/Z) and HDR UK (grant: MR\/S003975\/1). ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and\/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB\/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

The median incubation period for the infection was estimated to be 5.9\u00a0days (95% credible interval, CrI:\u00a04.4-7.6), with 95% of people who developed symptoms doing so within 11.2\u00a0days (95% CrI:\u00a07.6-18.0) after infection. On average, seroconversion occurred 9.1\u00a0days (95% CrI:\u00a07.0-11.6) after infection. The virus was detectable in blood for 9.9\u00a0days (95% CrI:\u00a06.9-21.4) on average.

Affinity measurements by SPR typically involve testing the binding of antigen in solution to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) immobilized on a chip and fitting the kinetics data using 1:1 Langmuir binding model to derive rate constants. However, when it is necessary to immobilize antigens instead of the mAbs, a bivalent analyte (1:2) binding model is required for kinetics analysis. This model is lacking in data analysis packages associated with high throughput SPR instruments and the packages containing this model do not explore multiple local minima and parameter identifiability issues that are common in non-linear optimization. Therefore, we developed a method to use a system of ordinary differential equations for analyzing 1:2 binding kinetics data. Salient features of this method include a grid search on parameter initialization and a profile likelihood approach to determine parameter identifiability. Using this method we found a non-identifiable parameter in data set collected under the standard experimental design. A simulation-guided improved experimental design led to reliable estimation of all rate constants. The method and approach developed here for analyzing 1:2 binding kinetics data will be valuable for expeditious therapeutic antibody discovery research.","journal":"Analytical biochemistry","reference":"Nguyen K, Li K, Flores K, Tomaras GD, Dennison SM, McCarthy JM.

Similarly, to fight against COVID-19, restrictive mass\r\nquarantine or lockdown has been implemented as the most important controlling measure.\r\nIndia has already enforced a lockdown of 10 weeks and is extending the period depending\r\non the current disease scenario. However, the idea that, if the susceptible population drops\r\nbelow certain threshold, the infection would naturally die out in small communities after\r\na fixed time (following the outbreak), unless the disease is reintroduced from outside, was\r\nproposed by M.

Although it is targeted for elimination of transmission by 2030, there remain numerous questions about the drivers of infection and how these vary geographically. In this study we focus on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which accounted for 84% of the global case burden in 2016, to explore changes in transmission across the country and elucidate factors which may have contributed to the persistence of disease or success of interventions in different regions. We present a Bayesian fitting methodology, applied to 168 endemic health zones (\u223c100,000 population size), which allows for calibration of a mechanistic gHAT model to case data (from the World Health Organization HAT Atlas) in an adaptive and automated framework. It was found that the model needed to capture improvements in passive detection to match observed trends in the data within former Bandundu and Bas Congo provinces indicating these regions have substantially reduced time to detection. Health zones in these provinces generally had longer burn-in periods during fitting due to additional model parameters. Posterior probability distributions were found for a range of fitted parameters in each health zone; these included the basic reproduction number estimates for pre-1998 (R0) which was inferred to be between 1 and 1.14, in line with previous gHAT estimates, with higher median values typically in health zones with more case reporting in the 2000s. Previously, it was not clear whether a fall in active case finding in the period contributed to the declining case numbers. The modelling here accounts for variable screening and suggests that underlying transmission has also reduced greatly-on average 96% in former Equateur, 93% in former Bas Congo and 89% in former Bandundu-Equateur and Bandundu having had the highest case burdens in 2000. This analysis also sets out a framework to enable future predictions for the country.","journal":"PLoS computational biology","reference":"Crump RE, Huang CI, Knock ES, Spencer SEF, Brown PE, Mwamba Miaka E, Shampa C, Keeling MJ, Rock KS.

Our inference is based on assessing the difference in the rates of self-reported influenza-like illness (ILI, defined as presence of fever and cough\/sore throat) among the survey participants during periods of active vs. low influenza circulation as well as estimating the probability of self-reported ILI for influenza cases. Here, we combined Flu Near You data with additional sources (Hong Kong household studies of symptoms of influenza cases and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates of vaccine coverage and effectiveness) to estimate influenza attack rates. The estimated influenza attack rate for the early vaccinated Flu Near You members (vaccination reported by week 45) aged 20-64 between calendar weeks 47-12 was 14.7%(95% CI(5.9%,24.1%)) for the 2012-2013 season and 3.6%(-3.3%,10.3%) for the 2013-2014 season.

At the same time, climate change is rendering the water supply even more uncertain for the future. Due to recurring water restrictions and increasing water-related fees triggered by droughts and water shortages, there is a widespread, growing discomfort with respect to future water availability. Among key stakeholders and local policy makers, this has led to an increased interest in modeling the availability of water resources, with the aim of developing and implementing the appropriate water resource infrastructure and management strategies. This paper examines the Washington metropolitan area (WMA) water supply system and uses a system dynamics approach as a planning tool to make an exploratory assessment of the adequacy of the study area\u0092s water supply system to meet future water demand under the influence of substantial droughts and climate change. This assessment finds that the study area is self-sufficient under normal climate conditions during the entire planning horizon but that it will be strained under moderately severe droughts. On the basis of the temperature, streamflow and precipitation projections made by climate change models specific to the WMA region, climate change is expected to improve the water supply reliability. However, climate change has uncertainty associated with it. One of the four climate models for the Potomac River basin projects a decrease in the precipitation and streamflow, which may result in a reduction in the water supply and the system\u0092s reliability. Regulating the price and the system losses are valuable tools that can be leveraged. But these policy interventions require stakeholder participation (price regulation) and capital investments (reduction of distribution losses). Finally, system reliability can also be improved by increasing water supplies.","journal":"Journal of Infrastructure Systems","reference":"Roma Bhatkoti, Konstantinos Triantis, Glenn E Moglen, Nasim S Sabounchi.

Countries should consider reactive vaccination in each outbreak event, together with maintaining routine infant vaccination as the primary intervention to reduce pneumococcal disease burden and outbreak risk.Pneumococcal meningitis outbreaks occur sporadically in the African meningitis belt. Outbreak control guidelines and interventions are well established for meningococcal but not pneumococcal meningitis. Mathematical modelling is a useful tool for assessing the potential impact of different pneumococcal control strategies. This work aimed to estimate the impact of reactive vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) had it been implemented in past African meningitis belt outbreaks and assess their efficiency relative to existing routine infant immunisation with PCV.Using recent pneumococcal meningitis outbreaks in Burkina Faso, Chad, and Ghana as case studies, we investigated the potential impact of reactive vaccination. We calculated the number needed to vaccinate to avert one case (NNV) in each outbreak setting and over all outbreaks and compared this to the NNV for existing routine infant vaccination. We extended previous analyses of reactive vaccination by considering longer-term protection in vaccinees over five years, incorporating a proxy for indirect effects. We found that implementing reactive vaccination in previous pneumococcal meningitis outbreaks could have averted up to 10-20\u00a0% of outbreak cases, with the biggest potential impact in Brong Ahafo, Ghana (2015-2016) and Goundi, Chad (2009). The NNV, and hence the value of reactive vaccination, varied greatly.

The immune system follows a circadian rhythm and, consequently, the chance of getting infected varies with the time of day an individual is exposed to the pathogen. The movement and interaction of people also follow 24-hour cycles, which couples these two phenomena. We use a stochastic metapopulation model informed by hourly mobility data for two medium-sized Chinese cities. By this setup, we investigate how the epidemic risk depends on the difference of the clocks governing the population movement and the immune systems. In most of the scenarios we test, we observe circadian rhythms would constrain the pace and extent of disease emergence. The three measures (strength, outward transmission and introduction speeds) are highly correlated with each other. For example of the Yushu City, outward transmission speed and introduction speed are correlated with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.83, and the speeds correlate to strength with coefficients of -0.85 and -0.75, respectively (all have p < 0.05), in simulations with no circadian effect and R0 = 1.5. The relation between the circadian rhythms of the immune system and daily routines in human mobility can affect the pace and extent of infectious disease spreading. Shifting commuting times could mitigate the emergence of outbreaks.","journal":"PloS one","reference":"Du Z, Holme P. (2020).

We characterized the relationship between mentions of cocaine in song lyrics and incidence of cocaine use and mortality in the US. Incidence of cocaine use from 2002 to 2017 was obtained from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health and cocaine overdose mortality rate from 2000 to 2017 was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control. Distributed lag models were fit using ordinary least squares on the first difference to identify associations between changes in cocaine lyric mentions and changes in incidence of cocaine use and mortality. A total of 5955 song lyrics with cocaine mentions were obtained from Lyrics.com. Cocaine mentions in song lyrics were stable from 2000 to 2010 then increased by 190% from 2010 to 2017. The first-order distributed lag model estimated that a 0.01 increase in mentions of cocaine in song lyrics is associated with an 11% increase in incidence of cocaine use within the same year and a 14% increase in cocaine mortality with a 2-year lag. Lag-times were confirmed with cross-correlation analyses and the association remained after accounting for street pricing of cocaine.

Understanding how the age-specific epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 has evolved throughout the pandemic is crucial for informing policy decisions. In this article, we aimed to develop an inference-based modeling approach to reconstruct the burden of true infections and hospital admissions in children, adolescents, and adults over the seven waves of four variants (wild-type, Alpha, Delta, and Omicron BA.1) during the first 2 years of the pandemic, using the Netherlands as the motivating example. We find that reported cases are a considerable underestimate and a generally poor predictor of true infection burden, especially because case reporting differs by age. The contribution of children and adolescents to total infection and hospitalization burden increased with successive variants and was largest during the Omicron BA.1 period. However, the ratio of hospitalizations to infections decreased with each subsequent variant in all age categories. Before the Delta period, almost all infections were primary infections occurring in naive individuals. During the Delta and Omicron BA.1 periods, primary infections were common in children but relatively rare in adults who experienced either reinfections or breakthrough infections. Our approach can be used to understand age-specific epidemiology through successive waves in other countries where random community surveys uncovering true SARS-CoV-2 dynamics are absent but basic surveillance and statistics data are available.","journal":"PNAS nexus","reference":"Boldea O, Alipoor A, Pei S, Shaman J, Rozhnova G.

This approach allows for flexible trajectories for each marker, accounts for potentially time-varying correlation between markers, and is robust to misspecification of knots. Despite its advantages, the application of multivariate penalized spline models, especially when biomarkers may be of different data types, has been limited in part due to its seemingly complexity in implementation. To overcome this, we describe a procedure that transforms the multivariate setting to the univariate one, and then makes use of the generalized linear mixed effect model representation of a penalized spline model to facilitate its implementation with standard statistical software. We performed simulation studies to evaluate the validity and efficiency through joint modeling of correlated biomarkers measured longitudinally compared to the univariate modeling approach.

Healthcare systems face complex choices between multiple highly efficacious, costly treatments. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of HCV treatments for chronic, genotype 1 HCV monoinfected, treatment-na\u00efve individuals in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and general U.S. healthcare systems.We conducted a decision-analytic Markov model-based cost-effectiveness analysis, employing appropriate payer perspectives and time horizons, and discounting benefits and costs at 3% annually. Interventions included: Sofosbuvir\/ledipasvir (SOF-LDV); ombitasvir\/paritaprevir\/ritonavir\/dasabuvir (3D); sofosbuvir\/simeprevir (SOF-SMV); sofosbuvir\/pegylated interferon\/ribavirin (SOF-RBV-PEG); boceprevir\/pegylated interferon\/ribavirin (BOC-RBV-PEG); and pegylated interferon\/ribavirin (PEG-RBV). Outcomes were sustained virologic response (SVR), advanced liver disease, costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness.SOF-LDV and 3D achieve higher SVR rates compared to older regimens and reduce advanced liver disease (>20% relative to no treatment), increasing QALYs by over 2 years per person. For the non-VA population, at current prices ($5,040 per week for SOF-LDV and $4,796 per week for 3D), SOF-LDV's lifetime cost ($293,370) is $18,000 lower than 3D's because of its shorter treatment duration in subgroups. SOF-LDV costs $17,100 per QALY gained relative to no treatment. 3D costs $208,000 per QALY gained relative to SOF-LDV. Both dominate other treatments and are even more cost-effective for the VA, though VA aggregate treatment costs still exceed $4 billion at SOF-LDV prices of $3,308 per week.

The ability to accurately detect these changes within individual patient samples is important in enabling early detection of VOCs. Such genomic scans for rarely acting positive selection are best performed via comparison of empirical data to simulated data wherein commonly acting evolutionary factors, including mutation and recombination, reproductive and infection dynamics, and purifying and background selection, can be carefully accounted for and parameterized. While there has been work to quantify these factors in SARS-CoV-2, they have yet to be integrated into a baseline model describing intra-host evolutionary dynamics. To construct such a baseline model, we develop a simulation framework that enables one to establish expectations for underlying levels and patterns of patient-level variation. By varying eight key parameters, we evaluated 12,096 different model-parameter combinations and compared them to existing empirical data. Of these, 592 models (\u223c5%) were plausible based on the resulting mean expected number of segregating variants. These plausible models shared several commonalities shedding light on intra-host SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary dynamics: severe infection bottlenecks, low levels of reproductive skew, and a distribution of fitness effects skewed towards strongly deleterious mutations. We also describe important areas of model uncertainty and highlight additional sequence data that may help to further refine a baseline model.

This study is based on the use of mathematical modeling approaches to assess the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics is impacted by population-level changes of human behavior due to factors such as (a) the severity of transmission (such as disease-induced mortality and level of symptomatic transmission), (b) fatigue due to the implementation of mitigation interventions measures (e.g., lockdowns) over a long (extended) period of time, (c) social peer-pressure, among others. A novel behavior-epidemiology model, which takes the form of a deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations, is developed and fitted using observed cumulative SARS-CoV-2 mortality data during the first wave in the United States. The model fits the observed data, as well as makes a more accurate prediction of the observed daily SARS-CoV-2 mortality during the first wave (March 2020-June 2020), in comparison to the equivalent model which does not explicitly account for changes in human behavior. This study suggests that, as more newly-infected individuals become asymptomatically-infectious, the overall level of positive behavior change can be expected to significantly decrease (while new cases may rise, particularly if asymptomatic individuals have higher contact rate, in comparison to symptomatic individuals).","journal":"Bulletin of mathematical biology","reference":"Pant B, Safdar S, Santillana M, Gumel AB.

As suggested by WHO guidelines, we proxied contact tracing performance as the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing out of all cases identified. We calculated the daily proportion of cases identified through contact tracing across 37 geographical units (32 departments and five districts). Further, we used a sequential log-log fixed-effects model to estimate the 21-days, 28-days, 42-days, and 56-days lagged impact of the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing on daily COVID-19 mortality. Both the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing and the daily number of COVID-19 deaths are smoothed using 7-day moving averages. Models control for the prevalence of active cases, second-degree polynomials, and mobility indices. Robustness checks to include supply-side variables were performed.Contact tracing is instrumental in containing infectious diseases. Its prioritization as a surveillance strategy will substantially impact reducing deaths while minimizing the impact on the fragile economic systems of lower and middle-income countries. This study provides lessons for other LMIC.We found that a 10 percent increase in the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing is related to COVID-19 mortality reductions between 0.8% and 3.4%. Our models explain between 47%-70% of the variance in mortality. Results are robust to changes of specification and inclusion of supply-side variables.","journal":"PloS one","reference":"Vecino-Ortiz AI, Villanueva Congote J, Zapata Bedoya S, Cucunuba ZM. (2021).

However, comprehensive generation time estimates for seasonal influenza, especially post the 2009 influenza pandemic, are lacking. We estimated the generation time utilizing data from a 7-site case-ascertained household study in the United States over two influenza seasons, 2021\/2022 and 2022\/2023. More than 200 individuals who tested positive for influenza and their household contacts were enrolled within 7 days of the first illness in the household. All participants were prospectively followed for 10 days completing daily symptom diaries and collecting nasal swabs, which were tested for influenza via RT-PCR. We analyzed these data by modifying a previously published Bayesian data augmentation approach that imputes infection times of cases to obtain both intrinsic (assuming no susceptible depletion) and realized (observed within household) generation times. We assessed the robustness of the generation time estimate by varying the incubation period, and generated estimates of the proportion of transmission before symptomatic onset, infectious period, and latent period. We estimated a mean intrinsic generation time of 3.2 (95% credible interval, CrI: 2.9-3.6) days, with a realized household generation time of 2.8 (95% CrI: 2.7-3.0) days. The generation time exhibited limited sensitivity to incubation period variation. Estimates of the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, the infectious period, and the latent period were sensitive to variation in incubation periods. Our study contributes to the ongoing efforts to refine estimates of the generation time for influenza. Our estimates, derived from recent data following the COVID-19 pandemic, are consistent with previous pre-pandemic estimates, and will be incorporated into real-time Rt estimation efforts.","journal":"medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences","reference":"Chan LYH, Morris SE, Stockwell MS, Bowman NM, Asturias E, Rao S, Lutrick K, Ellingson KD, Nguyen HQ, Maldonado Y, McLaren SH, Sano E, Biddle JE, Smith-Jeffcoat SE, Biggerstaff M, Rolfes MA, Talbot HK, Grijalva CG, Borchering RK, Mellis AM, .

The invasive tick species Haemaphysalis longicornis poses a significant public health threat due to its global expansion and its potential to carry a wide range of pathogens. We analyzed meta-transcriptomic data from 3595 adult H. longicornis ticks collected between 2016 and 2019 in 22 provinces across China, encompassing diverse ecological conditions. Generalized additive modelling revealed that climate factors exerted a stronger influence on the virome of H. longicornis compared to other ecological factors, such as ecotypes, distance to coastline, animal host, tick gender, and anti-viral immunity. We investigated the mechanistic understanding of how climate changes drive the tick virome using causality inference and emphasized its significance for public health. Our findings demonstrated that higher temperatures and lower relative humidity\/precipitation contribute to variations in animal host diversity, leading to an increased diversity of tick virome, particularly the evenness of vertebrate associated viruses. This finding may explain the evolution of tick-borne viruses into generalists across multiple hosts, thereby increasing the probability of spillover events involving tick-borne pathogens. Deep learning projections indicate that the diversity of H. longicornis virome is expected to increase in 81.9% of regions under the SSP8.5 scenario from 2019-2030.

Given the limited treatment options for this multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO), there is an urgent need for targeted strategies to prevent transmission. Here, we applied whole-genome sequencing to a comprehensive collection of clinical isolates to reconstruct regional transmission pathways and analyzed this transmission network in the context of statewide patient transfer data and patient-level clinical data to identify drivers of regional transmission. We found that high regional CRKP burdens were due to a small number of regional introductions, with subsequent regional proliferation occurring via patient transfers among health care facilities. While CRKP was predicted to have been imported into each facility multiple times, there was substantial variation in the ratio of intrafacility transmission events per importation, indicating that amplification occurs unevenly across regional facilities. While myriad factors likely influence intrafacility transmission rates, an understudied one is the potential for clinical characteristics of colonized and infected patients to influence their propensity for transmission. Supporting the contribution of high-risk patients to elevated transmission rates, we observed that patients colonized and infected with CRKP in high-transmission facilities had higher rates of carbapenem use, malnutrition, and dialysis and were older. This report highlights the potential for regional infection prevention efforts that are grounded in genomic epidemiology to identify the patients and facilities that make the greatest contribution to regional MDRO prevalence, thereby facilitating the design of precision interventions of maximal impact.","journal":"Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy","reference":"Han JH, Lapp Z, Bushman F, Lautenbach E, Goldstein EJC, Mattei L, Hofstaedter CE, Kim D, Nachamkin I, Garrigan C, Jain T, Bilker W, Wolford HM, Slayton RB, Wise J, Tolomeo P, Snitkin ES.

We performed an optimal design discrete choice experiment with partial profiles in a representative sample (N\u202f=\u202f1499) of the population in the United Kingdom in November 2016. Using a panel mixed logit model, we quantified, for four different types of infectious disease, the importance of a person's age during disease, how disease was prevented-via direct vaccine protection or herd protection-and whether the vaccine induced side effects. Our study shows clear patterns in how the public values vaccination programs. These diverge from the assumptions made in public health and cost-effectiveness models that inform decision-making. We found that side effects and infections in newborns and children were of primary importance to the perceived value of a vaccination program. Averting side effects was, in any age group, weighted three times as important as preventing an identical natural infection in a child whereas the latter was weighted six times as important as preventing the same infection in elderly aged 65-75 years. These findings were independent of the length or severity of the disease, and were robust across respondents' backgrounds. We summarize these patterns in a set of preference weights that can be incorporated into future models.

Here we incorporate Chinese national surveillance data on scrub typhus from 2010 to 2019 into a climate-driven generalized additive mixed model to explain the spatiotemporal dynamics of this disease and predict how it may be affected by climate change under various representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for three future time periods (the 2030s, 2050s, and 2080s).

Previous work has compared the ability of different human-focused surveillance strategies to detect ZIKV transmission in U.S. counties where no known transmission had occurred, but whether virological surveillance in mosquitoes could represent an effective surveillance system is unclear.We leveraged a unique set of data from human and virological surveillance in Ae. aegypti during the 2016 ZIKV epidemic in Caguas, Puerto Rico, to compare alternative strategies for detecting and monitoring ZIKV activity.In simulated high transmission scenarios (1 infection per 1,000 people per week), the models demonstrated that both approaches had estimated probabilities of detection of greater than 78%. In simulated low incidence scenarios, vector surveillance had higher sensitivity than human surveillance and sensitivity increased with more traps, more trapping effort, and testing. In contrast, the actual data from Caguas indicated that human virological surveillance was more sensitive than vector virological surveillance during periods of both high and low transmission.We developed a simulation model for mosquito and human surveillance strategies and simulated different transmission scenarios with varying infection rates and mosquito trap densities. We then calculated the expected weekly number of detected infections, the probability of detecting transmission, and the number of tests needed and compared the simulations with observed data from Caguas.In scenarios where human surveillance is not possible or when transmission intensity is very low, virological surveillance in Ae. aegypti may be able to detect and monitor ZIKV epidemic activity. However, surveillance for humans seeking care for Zika-like symptoms likely provides an equivalent or more sensitive indicator of transmission intensity in most circumstances.","journal":"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","reference":"Madewell ZJ, Hemme RR, Adams L, Barrera R, Waterman SH, Johansson MA.

Particularly for dengue virus (DENV), there is a major difficulty in quantifying human-vector contacts due to the unknown coupled effect of key heterogeneities. To test the hypothesis that the reduction of human out-of-home mobility due to dengue illness will significantly influence population-level dynamics and the structure of DENV transmission chains, we extended an existing modeling framework to include social structure, disease-driven mobility reductions, and heterogeneous transmissibility from different infectious groups. Compared to a baseline model, na\u00efve to human pre-symptomatic infectiousness and disease-driven mobility changes, a model including both parameters predicted an increase of 37% in the probability of a DENV outbreak occurring; a model including mobility change alone predicted a 15.5% increase compared to the baseline model. At the individual level, models including mobility change led to a reduction of the importance of out-of-home onward transmission (R, the fraction of secondary cases predicted to be generated by an individual) by symptomatic individuals (up to -62%) at the expense of an increase in the relevance of their home (up to +40%). An individual's positive contribution to R could be predicted by a GAM including a non-linear interaction between an individual's biting suitability and the number of mosquitoes in their home (>10 mosquitoes and 0.6 individual attractiveness significantly increased R). We conclude that the complex fabric of social relationships and differential behavioral response to dengue illness cause the fraction of symptomatic DENV infections to concentrate transmission in specific locations, whereas asymptomatic carriers (including individuals in their pre-symptomatic period) move the virus throughout the landscape. Our findings point to the difficulty of focusing vector control interventions reactively on the home of symptomatic individuals, as this approach will fail to contain virus propagation by visitors to their house and asymptomatic carriers.","journal":"PLoS computational biology","reference":"Schaber KL, Perkins TA, Lloyd AL, Waller LA, Kitron U, Paz-Soldan VA, Elder JP, Rothman AL, Civitello DJ, Elson WH, Morrison AC, Scott TW, Vazquez-Prokopec GM.

Strategy 'mAb' is more effective due to its assumed longer duration of protection versus maternal vaccination, but it was also assumed to be more expensive. Given all parameterised uncertainty, the optimal strategy of choice tends to change for increasing willingness to pay (WTP) values per DALY averted from the current situation to maternal vaccination (at WTP\u2009>\u2009US$1000) to mAB (at WTP\u2009>\u2009US$3500). The age-specific proportions of cases that are hospitalised and\/or die cause most of the uncertainty in the choice of optimal strategy.

The effectiveness and the prices of the interventions were simultaneously varied in extensive scenario analyses. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were the primary health outcomes for cost-effectiveness, integrated with probabilistic sensitivity analyses\u00a0and Expected Value of Partially Perfect Information analysis.Both the maternal and mAb strategies need to be competitively priced to be judged as relatively cost-effective.

Although reopening K-12 schools for in-person schooling is desirable for many reasons, officials understand that risk reduction strategies and detection of cases are imperative in creating a safe return to school. Furthermore, consequences of reclosing recently opened schools are substantial and impact teachers, parents, and ultimately educational experiences in children. To address competing interests in meeting educational needs with public safety, we compare the impact of physical separation through school cohorts on SARS-CoV-2 infections against policies acting at the level of individual contacts within classrooms. Using an age-stratified Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed model, we explore influences of reduced class density, transmission mitigation, and viral detection on cumulative prevalence. We consider several scenarios over a 6-month period including (1) multiple rotating cohorts in which students cycle through in-person instruction on a weekly basis, (2) parallel cohorts with in-person and remote learning tracks, (3) the impact of a hypothetical testing program with ideal and imperfect detection, and (4) varying levels of aggregate transmission reduction. Our mathematical model predicts that reducing the number of contacts through cohorts produces a larger effect than diminishing transmission rates per contact. Specifically, the latter approach requires dramatic reduction in transmission rates in order to achieve a comparable effect in minimizing infections over time. Further, our model indicates that surveillance programs using less sensitive tests may be adequate in monitoring infections within a school community by both keeping infections low and allowing for a longer period of instruction. Lastly, we underscore the importance of factoring infection prevalence in deciding when a local outbreak of infection is serious enough to require reverting to remote learning.","journal":"PloS one","reference":"Landeros A, Ji X, Lange K, Stutz TC, Xu J, Sehl ME, Sinsheimer JS.

Cumulative risk over 25 years from new infection was 7.9% (7.0, 8.9). In 2020, an estimated average age of individuals with prevalent infection was 62 (61, 63) for the US-born population, 55 (54, 55) for non-US-born, and 57 (56, 58) overall.

In the United States, most TB cases result from the progression of latent TB infection acquired over 2 years ago.Our analysis suggests that, although newly infected individuals face appreciable lifetime TB risks, most US individuals with latent TB infection were infected long ago, and face low future risks of developing TB. Better approaches are needed for identifying recently infected individuals and those with elevated progression risks.We synthesized evidence on TB natural history and incidence trends using a transmission-dynamic model.

Analysis was conducted on passive surveillance data of canine distemper (CDV)-positive wild mammal cases submitted to the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study, Athens, Georgia, US, between January 1975 and December 2019. Overall, 964 cases from 17 states were CDV positive, including 646 raccoons (Procyon lotor, 254 gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus, 33 striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), 18 coyotes (Canis latrans), four red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), three gray wolves (Canis lupus), three American black bears (Ursus americanus), two American mink (Mustela vison), and one long-tailed weasel (Mustela frenata). Raccoon and gray fox case data from the state of Georgia (n=441) were selected for further analysis. Autoregressive integrated moving average models were developed predicting raccoon and gray fox case numbers. The best-performing model for gray foxes used numbers of gray fox CDV cases from the previous 2 mo and of raccoon cases in the present month to predict the numbers of gray fox cases in the present month. The best-performing model for raccoon prediction used numbers of raccoon CDV cases from the previous month and of gray fox cases in the present month and previous 2 mo to predict numbers of raccoon cases in the present month. Temporal trends existed in CDV cases for both species, with cases more likely to occur during the breeding season. Spatial clustering of cases was more likely to occur in areas of medium to high human population density; fewer cases occurred in both the most densely populated and sparsely populated areas. This pattern was most prominent for raccoons, which may correspond to high transmission rates in suburban areas, where raccoon population densities are probably highest, possibly because of a combination of suitable habitat and supplemental resources.","journal":"Journal of wildlife diseases","reference":"Taylor K, Wilson JJ, Park AW, Nemeth NM, Yabsley M, Fenton H, Keel MK, Gottdenker NL.

Interactions among traits and the flow of information","abstract":"Although the environment varies, adaptive trait plasticity is uncommon, which can be due to either costs or limitations. Currently there is little evidence for costs of plasticity; limitations are a more promising explanation, including information reliability. A possible cause for a decrease in information reliability is the channeling of environmental information through one trait that then affects the phenotype of a second trait, the information path. Using an individual-based simulation model, I explored the ways in which configurations of trait interactions and patterns of environmental variation in space and time affect the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. I found that genotypes and phenotypes evolved to shorten and simplify the information path from the environment to fitness. A shortened path was characterized by a decrease in the amount of plasticity for traits that had a less direct connection between the environment of development and fitness. A simplified path was characterized by a decrease in the amount of plasticity for traits that had multiple paths between the environment and their phenotype. These results suggest that an eighth proposition be added to the theory of the evolution of phenotypic plasticity: Trait plasticity will evolve to minimize the information path between the environment and fitness.","journal":"Evolution; international journal of organic evolution","reference":"Scheiner SM.

Household contact tracing (HHCT), for which households of newly diagnosed cases are actively screened for additional infected individuals is a potentially efficient approach to finding new cases of tuberculosis, however randomized trials assessing the population-level effects of such interventions in settings with sustained community transmission have shown mixed results. One potential explanation for this is that household transmission is responsible for a variable proportion of population-level tuberculosis burden between settings. For example, transmission is more likely to occur in households in settings with a lower tuberculosis burden and where individuals mix preferentially in local areas, compared with settings with higher disease burden and more dispersed mixing. To better understand the relationship between endemic incidence levels, social mixing, and the impact of HHCT, we developed a spatially explicit model of coupled household and community transmission. We found that the impact of HHCT was robust across settings of varied incidence and community contact patterns. In contrast, we found that the effects of community contact tracing interventions were sensitive to community contact patterns. Our results suggest that the protective benefits of HHCT are robust and the benefits of this intervention are likely to be maintained across epidemiological settings.","journal":"PLoS computational biology","reference":"Havumaki J, Cohen T, Zhai C, Miller JC, Guikema SD, Eisenberg MC, Zelner J.

The burden was valued conventionally using accounting expenditures and wages, which we contrasted to the opportunity costs from forgone patients using a novel methodology.In England, norovirus is now the second-largest contributor of the gastrointestinal hospital burden. With the projected impact being greater than previously estimated, improved capture of relevant opportunity costs seems imperative for diseases such as norovirus.Between July 2013 and June 2016, 17.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.6%\u201221.6%) of primary and 23.8% (95% CI, 20.6%\u201229.9%) of secondary gastrointestinal diagnoses were norovirus attributable.

Effective control of these pathogens likely requires integrated approaches. We evaluated dengue management options in an endemic setting that combine novel vector control and vaccination using an agent-based model for Yucat\u00e1n, Mexico, fit to 37 y of data. Our intervention models are informed by targeted indoor residual spraying (TIRS) experiments; trial outcomes and World Health Organization (WHO) testing guidance for the only licensed dengue vaccine, CYD-TDV; and preliminary results for in-development vaccines. We evaluated several implementation options, including varying coverage levels; staggered introductions; and a one-time, large-scale vaccination campaign. We found that CYD-TDV and TIRS interfere: while the combination outperforms either alone, performance is lower than estimated from their separate benefits. The conventional model hypothesized for in-development vaccines, however, performs synergistically with TIRS, amplifying effectiveness well beyond their independent impacts. If the preliminary performance by either of the in-development vaccines is upheld, a one-time, large-scale campaign followed by routine vaccination alongside aggressive new vector control could enable short-term elimination, with nearly all cases avoided for a decade despite continuous dengue reintroductions. If elimination is impracticable due to resource limitations, less ambitious implementations of this combination still produce amplified, longer-lasting effectiveness over single-approach interventions.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","reference":"Hladish TJ, Pearson CAB, Toh KB, Rojas DP, Manrique-Saide P, Vazquez-Prokopec GM, Halloran ME, Longini IM Jr..

We performed genome-based and gene-specific Bayesian phylogenetic analyses to investigate how certain factors impact estimates of the infection dates in an acute HIV-1 infection cohort, RV217. In this cohort, HIV-1 diagnosis corresponded to the first RNA positive test and occurred a median of four days after the last negative test, allowing us to compare timing estimates using BEAST to a narrow window of infection. We analyzed HIV-1 sequences sampled one week, one month and six months after HIV-1 diagnosis in 39 individuals. We found that shared diversity and temporal signal was limited in acute infection, and insufficient to allow timing inferences in the shortest HIV-1 genes, thus dated phylogenies were primarily analyzed for env, gag, pol and near full-length genomes. There was no one best fitting model across participants and genes, though relaxed molecular clocks (73% of best fitting models) and the Bayesian skyline (49%) tended to be favored. For infections with single founders, the infection date was estimated to be around one week pre-diagnosis for env (IQR: 3-9 days) and gag (IQR: 5-9 days), whilst the genome placed it at a median of 10 days (IQR: 4-19).

It is crucial to characterize the disease and the evolution of the ongoing epidemic efficiently and accurately. Computational epidemiology can model the disease progress and underlying contact network, but suffers from the lack of real-time and fine-grained surveillance data. Social media, on the other hand, provides timely and detailed disease surveillance, but is insensible to the underlying contact network and disease model. This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised deep learning framework that integrates the strengths of computational epidemiology and social media mining techniques. Specifically, this framework learns the social media users' health states and intervention actions in real time, which are regularized by the underlying disease model and contact network. Conversely, the learned knowledge from social media can be fed into computational epidemic model to improve the efficiency and accuracy of disease diffusion modeling. We propose an online optimization algorithm to substantialize the above interactive learning process iteratively to achieve a consistent stage of the integration. The extensive experimental results demonstrated that our approach can effectively characterize the spatio-temporal disease diffusion, outperforming competing methods by a substantial margin on multiple metrics.","journal":"Proceedings.

As there was no evidence of impairment of national malaria control strategies, public health authorities attributed the surge to a temporal increase in gold mining activity in forested regions. However, systematic analysis of this association is lacking because of the difficulties associated with collecting reliable data for both malaria and mining. We aimed to investigate the association between the international gold price and Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission in Guyana between 2007 and 2019. We also aimed to evaluate the association between P falciparum cases and the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation pattern, which has previously been suggested as a major driver of malaria.Our analysis provides evidence that the P falciparum malaria surge observed in Guyana between 2008 and 2014 was likely to have been driven mainly by an increase in gold mining, while climate factors might have contributed synergistically. We propose that the international gold price over time is a useful indicator of malaria trends. We conclude that the feasibility of malaria elimination in Guyana, and in other areas in the Amazon where malaria and gold mining overlap, should be evaluated against the challenges posed by rapidly rising gold prices.Ram\u00f3n Areces Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and National Institute of General Medical Sciences.We used national malaria surveillance data from Guyana to estimate the correlation over time between the international gold price and reported P falciparum infections in individuals who were likely to be involved in mining activities (ie, men and boys aged between 15 and 50 years who were living in mining regions) for each month between 2007 and 2019. We compared the estimates with those obtained from individuals who were unlikely to be directly involved in mining activities (ie, women, children aged 12 years and younger, and adults aged over 70 years) and estimates obtained from individuals living in non-mining regions. We also evaluated the correlation between P falciparum infections and the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation pattern in the same subpopulations and time period. Lastly, we evaluated the performance of a statistical model formulated to estimate P falciparum infections in real time using the international gold price as the predictor variable.The proportion of P falciparum malaria cases in temporary residents, which was used as a proxy for circulating individuals involved in gold mining, was highest during the years of peak gold price (ie, between 2008 and 2014). Cases of malaria in all demographic groups showed a strong positive correlation with the gold price, but only in regions with mining camps (0\u00b788 [95% CI 0\u00b784-0\u00b789] for boys and men aged between 15 and 50 years and 0\u00b780 [0\u00b773-0\u00b785] for the aggregated population of women, children aged 12 years and younger, and adults older than 70 years). The highest correlation occurred earlier in men and boys aged between 15 and 50 years, the demographic most likely to be miners, suggesting that transmission in mining camps is followed by infections in the community. On the basis of these findings, we were able to reliably forecast P falciparum malaria trends using only the gold price as the predictor variable. A 1% increase in gold price was associated with a 2\u00b713% increase in P falciparum infections after 1 month in the mining populations, and with a 1\u00b763% increase after 2 months in the non-mining populations. Lastly, La Ni\u00f1a climatic events showed an additional, smaller positive correlation with malaria transmission.","journal":"The Lancet.

Entomological indicators associated with other biotic and abiotic parameters can assertively characterize the spatiotemporal trends related to dengue transmission risk. However, the unpredictability of the non-linear nature of the data, as well as the uncertainty and subjectivity inherent in biological data are often neglected in conventional models.Our study demonstrated the ability of fuzzy logic to characterize the city's spatiotemporal heterogeneity in relation to areas at high risk of dengue transmission, suggesting it can be considered as part of an integrated surveillance system to support timely decision-making.As an alternative for analyzing dengue-related data, we devised a fuzzy-logic approach to test ensembles of these indicators across categories, which align with the concept of degrees of truth to characterize the success of dengue transmission by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in an endemic city in Brazil. We used locally gathered entomological, demographic, environmental and epidemiological data as input sources using freely available data on digital platforms. The outcome variable, risk of transmission, was aggregated into three categories: low, medium, and high. Spatial data was georeferenced and the defuzzified values were interpolated to create a map, translating our findings to local public health managers and decision-makers to direct further vector control interventions.The classification of low, medium, and high transmission risk areas followed a seasonal trend expected for dengue occurrence in the region. The fuzzy approach captured the 2020 outbreak, when only 14.06% of the areas were classified as low risk. The classification of transmission risk based on the fuzzy system revealed effective in predicting an increase in dengue transmission, since more than 75% of high-risk areas had an increase in dengue incidence within the following 15 days.","journal":"BMC public health","reference":"de Souza Leandro A, de Oliveira F, Lopes RD, Rivas AV, Martins CA, Silva I, Villela DAM, Teixeira MG, Xavier SCDC, Maciel-de-Freitas R.

In order to better inform a previously published ordinary differential equation model, we performed a systematic literature search to identify studies documenting experimental infection of naive (control) equids in vaccination trials.

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced., assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.Wellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and National Institute for Health Research.We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.Our results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.","journal":"The Lancet.

While many cases of hearing loss in the United States were mild, growing prevalence, low usage of hearing aids, and aging populations indicate the rising impact of this condition in future years and the increasing importance of domestic access to hearing healthcare services. Large-scale audiometric surveys such as NHANES are needed to regularly assess hearing loss burden and access to healthcare, improving our understanding of who is impacted by hearing loss and what groups are most amenable to intervention.An estimated 72.88 million (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 68.53 to 77.30) people in the United States had hearing loss in 2019, accounting for 22.2% (20.9 to 23.6) of the total population. Hearing loss was responsible for 2.24 million (1.56 to 3.11) YLDs (3.6% (2.8 to 4.7) of total US YLDs). Age-standardized prevalence was higher in males (17.7% [16.7 to 18.8]) compared with females (11.9%, [11.2 to 12.5]). While most cases of hearing loss were mild (64.3%, 95% UI 61.0 to 67.6), disability was concentrated in cases that were moderate or more severe. The all-age prevalence of hearing loss in the United States was 28.1% (25.7 to 30.8) higher in 2019 than in 1990, despite stable age-standardized prevalence. An estimated 9.7% (8.6 to 11.0) of individuals with mild to profound hearing loss utilized a hearing aid, while 32.5% (31.9 to 33.2) of individuals with hearing loss experienced tinnitus. Occupational noise exposure was responsible for 11.2% (10.2 to 12.4) of hearing loss YLDs.We utilized population-representative surveys from the United States to estimate hearing loss prevalence for the Global Burden of Disease study. A key input data source in modeled estimates are the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), years 1988 to 2010. We ran hierarchical severity-specific models to estimate hearing loss prevalence. We then scaled severity-specific models to sum to total hearing impairment prevalence, adjusted estimates for hearing aid coverage, and split estimates by etiology and tinnitus status. We computed years lived with disability (YLDs), which quantifies the amount of health loss associated with a condition depending on severity and creates a common metric to compare the burden of disparate diseases. This was done by multiplying the prevalence of severity-specific hearing loss by corresponding disability weights, with additional weighting for tinnitus comorbidity.This article describes key data sources and methods used to estimate hearing loss in the United States, in the Global Burden of Disease study.

For keyplayer, the agreement was much lower; 42.7% (47\/110) and 35.3% (110\/312) of respondent and nonrespondent peer change agents, respectively, selected on the imputed networks were also selected on the observed network. Eigenvector also produced a stable set of peer change agents across the 100 imputed networks and was much less sensitive to the specified relational boundary.This is a case study from an HIV prevention project among young black men who have sex with men. Individual-level prevention interventions have had limited success among young black men who have sex with men, a population that is disproportionately affected by HIV; peer network-based interventions are a promising alternative. Facebook is an attractive digital platform because it enables broad characterization of social networks. There are, however, several challenges in using Facebook data for peer interventions, including the large size of Facebook networks, difficulty in assessing appropriate methods to identify candidate peer change agents, boundary specification issues, and partial observation of social network data.Although we do not have a gold standard indicating which algorithm produces the most optimal set of peer change agents, the lower sensitivity of eigenvector centrality to key assumptions leads us to conclude that it may be preferable. The methods we employed to address the challenges in using Facebook networks may prove timely, given the rapidly increasing interest in using online social networks to improve population health.Our sample included 298 uConnect study respondents who answered a bio-behavioral survey in person and whose Facebook friend lists were downloaded (2013-2014). The study participants had over 180,000 total Facebook friends who were not involved in the study (nonrespondents). We did not observe friendships between these nonrespondents. Given the large number of nonrespondents whose networks were partially observed, a relational boundary was specified to select nonrespondents who were well connected to the study respondents and who may be more likely to influence the health behaviors of young black men who have sex with men. A stochastic model-based imputation technique, derived from the exponential random graph models, was applied to simulate 100 networks where unobserved friendships between nonrespondents were imputed. To identify peer change agents, the eigenvector centrality and keyplayer positive algorithms were used; both algorithms are suitable for identifying individuals in key network positions for information diffusion. For both algorithms, we assessed the sensitivity of identified peer change agents to the imputation model, the stability of identified peer change agents across the imputed networks, and the effect of the boundary specification on the identification of peer change agents.","journal":"Journal of medical Internet research","reference":"Khanna AS, Goodreau SM, Michaels S, Schneider JA.

It is an intuitively justified approach based on the concept of space\u0096time clustering of malaria cases. When an index malaria clinical case is detected, it triggers reactive screening and treatment in the index house and neighbouring houses. However, the efficacy of this approach at varying screening radii and malaria prevalence remains ill defined.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nData were obtained from a detailed demographic and geographic surveillance study in four villages on the Myanmar\u0096Thailand border. Clinical cases were recorded at village malaria clinics and were linked back to patients\u0092 residencies. These data were used to simulate the efficacy of reactive case detection for clinical cases using rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). Simulations took clinical cases in a given month and tabulated the number of cases that would have been detected in the following month at varying screening radii around the index houses. Simulations were run independently for both falciparum and vivax malaria. Each simulation of a reactive case detection effort was run in comparison with a strategy using random selection of houses for screening.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nIn approximately half of the screenings for falciparum and 10% for vivax it would have been impossible to detect any malaria cases regardless of the screening strategy because the screening would have occurred during times when there were no cases. When geographically linked cases were present in the simulation, reactive case detection would have only been successful at detecting most malaria cases using larger screening radii (150-m radius and above). At this screening radius and above, reactive case detection does not perform better than random screening of an equal number of houses in the village. Screening within very small radii detects only a very small proportion of cases, but despite this low performance is better than random screening with the same sample size.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nThe results of these simulations indicate that reactive case detection for clinical cases using RDTs has limited ability in halting transmission in regions of low and unstable transmission. This is linked to high spatial heterogeneity of cases, acquisition of malaria infections outside the village, as well missing asymptomatic infections. When cases are few and sporadic, reactive case detection would result in major time and budgetary losses.","journal":"Malaria Journal","reference":"Daniel M Parker, Jordi Landier, Lorenz Von Seidlein, Arjen Dondorp, Lisa White, Borimas Hanboonkunupakarn, Richard J Maude, Fran\u00e7ois H Nosten.

A vaccine product with characteristics similar to those of the Oxford\/AstraZeneca COVID-19 (AZD1222) vaccine was used in the base case scenario and was complemented by sensitivity analyses around efficacies similar to other COVID-19 vaccines. Both fixed dosing intervals at 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks and dose-specific intervals that prioritise specific doses for certain age groups were tested. Optimal intervals minimise COVID-19 mortality between March 2021 and December 2022. We incorporated the emergence of variants of concern (VOCs) into the model and conducted a benefit-risk assessment to quantify the tradeoff between health benefits versus adverse events following immunisation.In settings where the COVID-19 vaccine supply is constrained, extending the intervals between the first and second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine may allow more people receive their first doses earlier. Our aim is to estimate the health impact of COVID-19 vaccination alongside benefit-risk assessment of different dosing intervals in 13 middle-income countries (MICs) of Europe.World Health Organization.We infer that longer dosing intervals of over six months could reduce COVID-19 mortality in MICs of Europe. Certain parameters, such as rapid waning of first-dose induced immunity and increased immune escape through the emergence of VOCs, could significantly shorten the optimal dosing intervals.In all countries modelled, optimal strategies are those that prioritise the first doses among older adults (60+ years) or adults (20+ years), which lead to dosing intervals longer than six months. In comparison, a four-week fixed dosing interval may incur 10.1% [range: 4.3% - 19.0%; n\u00a0=\u00a013 (countries)] more deaths. The rapid waning of the immunity induced by the first dose (i.e. with means ranging 60-120 days as opposed to 360 days in the base case) resulted in shorter optimal dosing intervals of 8-20 weeks. Benefit-risk ratios were the highest for fixed dosing intervals of 8-12 weeks.","journal":"The Lancet regional health.

For jointly modeling multivariate clustered semi-continuous responses, the covariate effects in the positive parts can be proportionally constrained to the covariate effects in the logistic part, yielding a multivariate two-part fixed effects model. It is shown that, both theoretically and experimentally, the proportionally constrained model is more efficient than the unconstrained model in terms of parameter estimation, and thus provides a deeper understanding of the data structure when the proportionality structure holds. A robust variance estimation method is also introduced and tested under various model mis-specified cases. The proposed model is applied to data from a randomized controlled trial evaluating potential preventive effects of meditation or exercise on duration and severity of acute respiratory infection illness. The new analysis infers that meditation not only has highly significant effects on reduction of acute respiratory infection severity and duration, but also has significant effects on preventing acute respiratory infection, which was not previously reported in the literature.","journal":"Statistical methods in medical research","reference":"Xie Y, Zhang Z, Rathouz PJ, Barrett BP.

Implementation of indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticide, a proven vector control intervention, has been limited and difficult to sustain partly because questions remain on its added impact over widely accepted interventions such as bed nets. Using data from 14 enhanced surveillance health facilities in Uganda, a country with high bed net coverage yet high malaria burden, we estimate the impact of starting and stopping IRS on changes in malaria incidence. We show that stopping IRS was associated with a 5-fold increase in malaria incidence within 10 months, but reinstating IRS was associated with an over 5-fold decrease within 8 months. In areas where IRS was initiated and sustained, malaria incidence dropped by 85% after year 4. IRS could play a critical role in achieving global malaria targets, particularly in areas where progress has stalled.","journal":"Nature communications","reference":"Namuganga JF, Epstein A, Nankabirwa JI, Mpimbaza A, Kiggundu M, Sserwanga A, Kapisi J, Arinaitwe E, Gonahasa S, Opigo J, Ebong C, Staedke SG, Shililu J, Okia M, Rutazaana D, Maiteki-Sebuguzi C, Belay K, Kamya MR, Dorsey G, Rodriguez-Barraquer I.

The timeline from initial infection with HPV to the onset of invasive cervical cancer spans decades, and observational studies of this process are limited to settings in which treatment of precancerous lesions was withheld or inadequate. Such studies have been critical for understanding the natural history of HPV. Modeling can shed additional insight on the natural history of HPV, especially across geographical settings with varying prevalence of factors known to affect the host-side immune response to HPV, such as HIV and tobacco use. In this study, we create models for the 30 most populous countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, each with country-specific demographic, and behavioral inputs. We found that it was not possible to fit the data if we assumed that the natural history parameters were exactly identical for all countries, even after accounting for demographic and behavioral differences, but that we could achieve a good fit with the addition of a single immunocompetence parameter for each country. Our results indicate that variation in host immune responses may play a role in explaining the differences in the burden of cervical cancer between countries, which in turn implies a greater need for more geographically diverse data collection to understand the natural history of HPV.","journal":"Scientific reports","reference":"Stuart RM, Cohen JA, Abeysuriya RG, Sanz-Leon P, Kerr CC, Rao D, Klein DJ.

Because many infectious diseases spread through interaction, contact tracing is widely used to facilitate case discovery and control. However, what determines the efficacy of contact tracing has not been fully understood. Here we reveal that, compared with 'forward' tracing (tracing to whom disease spreads), 'backward' tracing (tracing from whom disease spreads) is profoundly more effective. The effectiveness of backward tracing is due to simple but overlooked biases arising from the heterogeneity in contacts. We argue that, even if the directionality of infection is unknown, it is possible to perform backward-aiming contact tracing. Using simulations on both synthetic and high-resolution empirical contact datasets, we show that strategically executed contact tracing can prevent a substantial fraction of transmissions with a higher efficiency-in terms of prevented cases per isolation-than case isolation alone. Our results call for a revision of current contact-tracing strategies so that they leverage all forms of bias. It is particularly crucial that we incorporate backward and deep tracing in a digital context while adhering to the privacy-preserving requirements of these new platforms.","journal":"Nature physics","reference":"Kojaku S, H\u00e9bert-Dufresne L, Mones E, Lehmann S, Ahn YY.

One complicating factor is that the microbiome is often transmitted imperfectly across host generations, leading to questions about the degree to which the microbiome contributes to host adaptation. Here, using an evolutionary model, we demonstrate that decreasing vertical transmission fidelity can increase microbiome variation, and thus phenotypic variation, across hosts. When the most beneficial microbial genotypes change unpredictably from one generation to the next (for example, in variable environments), hosts can maximize fitness by increasing the microbiome variation among offspring, as this improves the chance of there being an offspring with the right microbial combination for the next generation. Imperfect vertical transmission can therefore be adaptive in varying environments. We characterize how selection on vertical transmission is shaped by environmental conditions, microbiome changes during host development and the contribution of other factors to trait variation. We illustrate how environmentally dependent microbial effects can favour intermediate transmission and set our results in the context of examples from natural systems. We also suggest research avenues to empirically test our predictions. Our model provides a basis to understand the evolutionary pathways that potentially led to the wide diversity of microbe transmission patterns found in nature.","journal":"Nature ecology & evolution","reference":"Bruijning M, Henry LP, Forsberg SKG, Metcalf CJE, Ayroles JF.

Many methods exist to reconstruct a phylogeny from such genomes, which represents how the genomes are related to one another. However, such a phylogeny is not directly informative about transmission events between individuals. TransPhylo is a software tool implemented as an R package designed to bridge the gap between pathogen phylogenies and transmission trees. TransPhylo is based on a combined model of transmission between hosts and pathogen evolution within each host. It can simulate both phylogenies and transmission trees jointly under this combined model. TransPhylo can also reconstruct a transmission tree based on a dated phylogeny, by exploring the space of transmission trees compatible with the phylogeny. A transmission tree can be represented as a coloring of a phylogeny where each color represents a different host of the pathogen, and TransPhylo provides convenient ways to plot these colorings and explore the results.

To better estimate children's exposure and risk from recycled tire rubber used in synthetic turf and playground mats, there is a need to collect detailed accurate information on mouthing activity and dermal contact behaviors. The objective of this study was to quantify and analyze micro-level activity time series (MLATS) data from children aged 1-12 years old while playing (non-sport-related games) at turf-like locations and playgrounds. Another objective was to estimate the incidental ingestion rate of rubber crumb among children.For children playing on turf, there were significant differences between younger (1-6 y) and older (7-12 y) children for the mouthing median duration with non-dietary objects and all objects. For children playing on playground structures, we found significant mouthing frequency differences between younger (1-6 y) and older children (7-12 y) with all objects, and for mouthing median duration with non-dietary objects.

Without route to testing, other epidemiological data will be required to estimate the magnitude of potential bias in a conventional TND study. Since these studies may need to be conducted retrospectively, public health responses should obtain these data, and generic protocols for outbreak and pandemic response studies should emphasize the need to record routes to testing.Using a conventional TND study, our model finds biases in vaccine effectiveness estimates. Bias arises due to differential recruitment from self-reporting and contact-tracing, and due to clustering of vaccination. We estimate the degree of bias when recruitment route is not available, and propose a study design to eliminate the bias if recruitment route is recorded.Infectious disease outbreaks present unique challenges to study designs for vaccine evaluation. Test-negative design (TND) studies have previously been used to estimate vaccine effectiveness and have been proposed for Ebola virus disease (EVD) vaccines. However, there are key differences in how cases and controls are recruited during outbreaks and pandemics of novel pathogens, whcih have implications for the reliability of effectiveness estimates using this design.We use a modelling approach to quantify TND bias for a prophylactic vaccine under varying study and epidemiological scenarios. Our model accounts for heterogeneity in vaccine distribution and for two potential routes to testing and recruitment into the study: self-reporting and contact-tracing. We derive conventional and hybrid TND estimators for this model and suggest ways to translate public health response data into the parameters of the model.","journal":"International journal of epidemiology","reference":"Pearson CAB, Edmunds WJ, Hladish TJ, Eggo RM.

Comparing T-SPOT.TB and QFT-GIT, the sensitivities [95% confidence interval (CI)] were 82.3% (95% CI 77.7% to 85.9%) and 67.3% (95% CI 62.1% to 72.2%), respectively, whereas specificities were 82.6% (95% CI 78.6% to 86.1%) and 80.4% (95% CI 76.1% to 84.1%), respectively. T-SPOT.TB was more sensitive than QFT-GIT (relative sensitivity 1.22, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.31; p\u2009<\u20090.001), but the specificities were similar (relative specificity 1.02, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.08; p\u2009=\u20090.3). For both IGRAs the sensitivity was lower and the specificity was higher for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive than for HIV-negative patients. The most promising novel antigen was Rv3615c. The added value of Rv3615c to T-SPOT.TB was a 9% (95% CI 5% to 12%) relative increase in sensitivity at the expense of specificity, which had a relative decrease of 7% (95% CI 4% to 10%). The use of current IGRA tests for ruling out active TB is unlikely to be considered cost-effective if a QALY was valued at \u00a320,000 or \u00a330,000. For T-SPOT.TB, the probability of being cost-effective for a willingness to pay of \u00a320,000\/QALY was 26% and 21%, when patients with indeterminate test results were excluded or included, respectively. In comparison, the QFT-GIT probabilities were 8% and 6%. Although the use of IGRAs is cost saving, the health detriment is large owing to delay in diagnosing active TB, leading to prolonged illness. There was substantial between-patient variation in the tests used in the diagnostic pathway.Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratios were calculated to determine diagnostic accuracy.

Three-dose efficacy in the lowest-transmission-intensity group (0.25 cases per person-year [CPPY]) decreased from 88.2% to 15.0% over 4.5 years, compared with 81.6% to -27.7% in the highest-transmission-intensity group (3 CPPY).Using data from the 2009-2014 phase III trial (NCT00866619) in Lilongwe, Malawi; Kintampo, Ghana; and Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9, Gabon, we evaluate this hypothesis by estimating malaria incidence in each vaccine group over time and in varying transmission settings. After estimating transmission intensities using ecological variables, we fit models with 3-way interactions between vaccination, time, and transmission intensity.","journal":"The Journal of infectious diseases","reference":"Bell GJ, Goel V, Essone P, Dosoo D, Adu B, Mensah BA, Gyaase S, Wiru K, Mougeni F, Osei M, Minsoko P, Sinai C, Niar\u00e9 K, Juliano JJ, Hudgens M, Ghansah A, Kamthunzi P, Mvalo T, Agnandji ST, Bailey JA, Asante KP, Emch M.

A common way of representing the underlying processes in these models is as a system of stochastic processes which can be simulated forwards in time. Inference of model parameters based on observed time-series data can then be performed using sequential Monte Carlo techniques. However, using these methods for routine inference problems can be made difficult due to various engineering considerations: allowing model design to change in response to new data and ideas, writing model code which is highly performant, and incorporating all of this with up-to-date statistical techniques. Here, we describe a suite of packages in the R programming language designed to streamline the design and deployment of state space models, targeted at infectious disease modellers but suitable for other domains. Users describe their model in a familiar domain-specific language, which is converted into parallelised C++ code. A fast, parallel, reproducible random number generator is then used to run large numbers of model simulations in an efficient manner. We also provide standard inference and prediction routines, though the model simulator can be used directly if these do not meet the user's needs. These packages provide guarantees on reproducibility and performance, allowing the user to focus on the model itself, rather than the underlying computation. The ability to automatically generate high-performance code that would be tedious and time-consuming to write and verify manually, particularly when adding further structure to compartments, is crucial for infectious disease modellers. Our packages have been critical to the development cycle of our ongoing real-time modelling efforts in the COVID-19 pandemic, and have the potential to do the same for models used in a number of different domains.","journal":"Wellcome open research","reference":"FitzJohn RG, Knock ES, Whittles LK, Perez-Guzman PN, Bhatia S, Guntoro F, Watson OJ, Whittaker C, Ferguson NM, Cori A, Baguelin M, Lees JA.

The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study is a repeat cross-sectional study of over 98,000 people every round (rounds approximately monthly) that estimates infection prevalence in England. We used Bayesian P-splines to estimate prevalence and the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) nationally, regionally and by age group from round 8 (beginning 6 January 2021) to round 13 (ending 12 July 2021) of REACT-1. As a comparator, a separate segmented-exponential model was used to quantify the impact on Rt of each relaxation of restrictions.Following an initial plateau of 1.54% until mid-January, infection prevalence decreased until 13 May when it reached a minimum of 0.09%, before increasing until the end of the study to 0.76%. Following the first easing of restrictions, which included schools reopening, the reproduction number Rt increased by 82% (55%, 108%), but then decreased by 61% (82%, 53%) at the second easing of restrictions, which was timed to match the Easter school holidays. Following further relaxations of restrictions, the observed Rt increased steadily, though the increase due to these restrictions being relaxed was offset by the effects of vaccination and also affected by the rapid rise of Delta. There was a high degree of synchrony in the temporal patterns of prevalence between regions and age groups.High-resolution prevalence data fitted to P-splines allowed us to show that the lockdown was effective at reducing risk of infection with school holidays\/closures playing a significant part.We characterise how the lockdown and subsequent easing of restrictions affected trends in SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence.","journal":"PLoS computational biology","reference":"Eales O, Wang H, Haw D, Ainslie KEC, Walters CE, Atchison C, Cooke G, Barclay W, Ward H, Darzi A, Ashby D, Donnelly CA, Elliott P, Riley S.

Response and recovery interventions must focus on tackling drivers of ethnic inequalities which increase exposure risk and vulnerabilities to severe disease, including structural racism and racial discrimination.77 studies comprising over 200,000,000 participants were included.

However, in many LMICs, traditional data sets on travel such as commuting surveys as well as non-traditional sources such as mobile phone data are lacking, or, where available, have only rarely been leveraged by the public health community. Evaluating the accuracy of available data to measure transmission-relevant travel may be further hampered by limited reporting of suspected and laboratory confirmed infections. Here, we leverage case data collected as part of a COVID-19 dashboard collated via daily reports from the Malagasy authorities on reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 across the 22 regions of Madagascar. We compare the order of the timing of when cases were reported with predictions from a SARS-CoV-2 metapopulation model of Madagascar informed using various measures of connectivity including a gravity model based on different measures of distance, Internal Migration Flow data, and mobile phone data. Overall, the models based on mobile phone connectivity and the gravity-based on Euclidean distance best predicted the observed spread. The ranks of the regions most remote from the capital were more difficult to predict but interestingly, regions where the mobile phone connectivity model was more accurate differed from those where the gravity model was most accurate. This suggests that there may be additional features of mobility or connectivity that were consistently underestimated using all approaches, but are epidemiologically relevant.

We first analyze the correlation between NME rates and vaccine coverage for 3 significant childhood vaccinations. Furthermore, we assess the effects of policy changes in a subset of states, using a correlative approach at the state level and performing a clustering analysis at the county level.We find that higher rates of exemptions are associated with lower vaccination rates of school-aged children in all cases. In a subset of states where exemption policy has recently changed, we show that the effects on statewide NME rates vary widely and that decreases in NMEs can lead to an increase in other types of exemptions. Finally, our clustering analysis in California, Illinois, and Connecticut shows that policy changes affect the spatial distribution of NMEs.","journal":"Open forum infectious diseases","reference":"Garnier R, Nedell ER, Omer SB, Bansal S.

A modelling study of influenza vaccination strategies in children.","abstract":"We present a multi-annual, individual-based, stochastic, force of infection model that accounts for individual exposure histories and disease\/vaccine dynamics influencing susceptibility. We simulate birth cohorts that experience yearly influenza epidemics and follow them until age 18 to determine attack rates and the number of infections during childhood. We perform simulations under baseline conditions, with an assumed vaccination coverage of 44%, to compare annual vaccination to no and biennial vaccination. We relax our baseline assumptions to explore how our model assumptions impact vaccination program performance. At baseline, we observed less than half the number of infections between the ages 2 and 10 under annual vaccination in children who had been vaccinated at least half the time compared to no vaccination. When averaged over all ages 0-18, the number of infections under annual vaccination was 2.07 (2.06, 2.08) compared to 2.63 (2.62, 2.64) under no vaccination, and 2.38 (2.37, 2.40) under biennial vaccination. When we introduced a penalty for repeated exposures, we observed a decrease in the difference in infections between the vaccination strategies. Specifically, the difference in childhood infections under biennial compared to annual vaccination decreased from 0.31 to 0.04 as exposure penalty increased.Many countries include annual vaccination of children against influenza in their vaccination programs. In the United Kingdom (UK), annual vaccination of children aged of 2 to 10 against influenza is recommended. However, little research has evaluated whether annual vaccination is the best strategy, while accounting for how past infection and vaccination may affect an individual's susceptibility to infection in the current influenza season. Prior work has suggested that there may be a negative effect of repeated vaccination. In this work we developed a stochastic, individual-based model to assess the impact of repeated vaccination strategies on childhood infections. Specifically, we first compare annual vaccination to no vaccination and then annual vaccination to biennial (every other year) vaccination. We use the UK as our motivating example. We found that an annual vaccination strategy resulted in the fewest childhood infections, followed by biennial vaccination. The difference in number of childhood infections between the different vaccination strategies decreased when we introduced a penalty for repeated exposures. Our work confirms the value of annual vaccination in children, but also shows that similar benefits of vaccination can be obtained by implementing a biennial vaccination program, particularly when there is a negative effect of repeated vaccinations.Annual vaccination of children against influenza is a key component of vaccination programs in many countries.

This study aimed to improve the accuracy of a machine-learning algorithm to predict opioid overdose risk by integrating human services and criminal justice data with health claims data to capture the social determinants of overdose risk. This prognostic study included Medicaid beneficiaries (n = 237,259) in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania enrolled between 2015 and 2018, randomly divided into training, testing, and validation samples. We measured 290 potential predictors (239 derived from Medicaid claims data) in 30-day periods, beginning with the first observed Medicaid enrollment date during the study period. Using a gradient boosting machine, we predicted a composite outcome (i.e., fatal or nonfatal opioid overdose constructed using medical examiner and claims data) in the subsequent month. We compared prediction performance between a Medicaid claims only model to one integrating human services and criminal justice data with Medicaid claims (i.e., integrated model) using several metrics (e.g., C-statistic, number needed to evaluate [NNE] to identify one overdose). Beneficiaries were stratified into risk-score decile subgroups. The samples (training = 79,087, testing = 79,086, validation = 79,086) had similar characteristics (age = 38\u00b118 years, female = 56%, white = 48%, having at least one overdose = 1.7% during study period).

Our results do not suggest if one \"should or should not\" use VSP, rather, emphasizes the need for patient selection regarding which patients would most benefit from VSP when evaluating quality of life and long-term complications. Further studies are necessary to demonstrate improved long-term risk for hardware failure\/exposure in VSP compared to FHR.This study is an economic evaluation comparing virtual surgical planning (VSP) utilization to free hand mandibular reconstruction (FHR) for advanced oral cavity cancer, for which the cost effectiveness remains poorly understood. The proposed clinical benefits of VSP must be weighed against the additional upfront costs.In the base case scenario, total VSP strategy cost was $49,498 with 8.37 QALYs gained while FHR cost was $42,478 with 8.27 QALY gained. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), or the difference in cost\/difference in effectiveness, for VSP was calculated at $68,382\/QALY gained. VSP strategy favorability was sensitive to variations of patient age at diagnosis and institutional VSP cost with one-way sensitivity analysis. VSP was less economically favorable for patients >75.5\u2009years of age or for institutional VSP costs >$10,745. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 55% of iterations demonstrated an ICER value below a $100,000\/QALY threshold.","journal":"Microsurgery","reference":"Gardiner L, Smith B, Kubik M, Solari M, Smith K, de Almeida JR, Sridharan S.

The vital rates of these ectothermic vectors and parasites respond strongly and nonlinearly to temperature and therefore to climate change. Here, we review how trait-based approaches can synthesise and mechanistically predict the temperature dependence of transmission across vectors, pathogens, and environments. We present 11 pathogens transmitted by 15 different mosquito species - including globally important diseases like malaria, dengue, and Zika - synthesised from previously published studies. Transmission varied strongly and unimodally with temperature, peaking at 23-29\u00baC and declining to zero below 9-23\u00baC and above 32-38\u00baC. Different traits restricted transmission at low versus high temperatures, and temperature effects on transmission varied by both mosquito and parasite species. Temperate pathogens exhibit broader thermal ranges and cooler thermal minima and optima than tropical pathogens. Among tropical pathogens, malaria and Ross River virus had lower thermal optima (25-26\u00baC) while dengue and Zika viruses had the highest (29\u00baC)\u00a0thermal optima. We expect warming to increase transmission below thermal optima but decrease transmission above optima. Key directions for future work include linking mechanistic models to field transmission, combining temperature effects with control measures, incorporating trait variation and temperature variation, and investigating climate adaptation and migration.","journal":"Ecology letters","reference":"Mordecai EA, Caldwell JM, Grossman MK, Lippi CA, Johnson LR, Neira M, Rohr JR, Ryan SJ, Savage V, Shocket MS, Sippy R, Stewart Ibarra AM, Thomas MB, Villena O.

Due to the economic impacts of social distancing, there is growing desire to relax these measures. To characterize a range of possible strategies for control and to understand their consequences, we performed an optimal control analysis of a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Given that the pandemic is already underway and controls have already been initiated, we calibrated our model to data from the USA and focused our analysis on optimal controls from May 2020 through December 2021. We found that a major factor that differentiates strategies that prioritize lives saved versus reduced time under control is how quickly control is relaxed once social distancing restrictions expire in May 2020. Strategies that maintain control at a high level until at least summer 2020 allow for tapering of control thereafter and minimal deaths, whereas strategies that relax control in the short term lead to fewer options for control later and a higher likelihood of exceeding hospital capacity. Our results also highlight that the potential scope for controlling COVID-19 until a vaccine is available depends on epidemiological parameters about which there is still considerable uncertainty, including the basic reproduction number and the effectiveness of social distancing. In light of those uncertainties, our results do not constitute a quantitative forecast and instead provide a qualitative portrayal of possible outcomes from alternative approaches to control.","journal":"Bulletin of mathematical biology","reference":"Perkins TA, Espa\u00f1a G.

Use of both pneumococcal vaccines was more effective but substantially more expensive.Strategies were examined in hypothetical U.S. 65-year-old population cohorts and segmented into health states based on age- and population-specific data in a Markov state-transition model with a lifetime time horizon from a healthcare perspective. Black population cohorts were examined separately given greater illness risk and lower vaccine uptake.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, resulting in suspension of many clinical preventive services, pediatric vaccination rates in the United States have fallen precipitously, dramatically increasing risk of measles resurgence. Previous research has shown that measles outbreaks in high-coverage contexts are driven by spatial clustering of nonvaccination, which decreases local immunity below the herd immunity threshold. However, little is known about how to best conduct surveillance and target interventions to detect and address these high-risk areas, and most vaccination data are reported at the state-level-a resolution too coarse to detect community-level clustering of nonvaccination characteristic of recent outbreaks. In this paper, we perform a series of computational experiments to assess the impact of clustered nonvaccination on outbreak potential and magnitude of bias in predicting disease risk posed by measuring vaccination rates at coarse spatial scales. We find that, when nonvaccination is locally clustered, reporting aggregate data at the state- or county-level can result in substantial underestimates of outbreak risk. The COVID-19 pandemic has shone a bright light on the weaknesses in US infectious disease surveillance and a broader gap in our understanding of how to best use detailed spatial data to interrupt and control infectious disease transmission. Our research clearly outlines that finer-scale vaccination data should be collected to prevent a return to endemic measles transmission in the United States.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","reference":"Masters NB, Eisenberg MC, Delamater PL, Kay M, Boulton ML, Zelner J.

Our aims were to determine the target limit of detection (LOD) necessary to diagnose the majority of people with HCV eligible for treatment, and identify characteristics associated with low-level viraemia (LLV) (defined as the lowest 3% of the distribution of HCV RNA) to understand those at risk of being misdiagnosed.In this global dataset, a test with an LOD of 1,318\u202fIU\/ml would identify 97% of viraemic HCV infections among almost all populations. This LOD will help guide manufacturers in the development of affordable point-of-care diagnostics to expand HCV testing and linkage to care in low- and middle-income countries.The dataset included 66,640 individuals with HCV viraemia from across the world. The LOD for the 95th and 99th percentiles were 3,311\u202fIU\/ml and 214\u202fIU\/ml. The LOD for the 97th percentile was 1,318\u202fIU\/ml (95% CI 1,298.4-1,322.3). Factors associated with LLV, defined as HCV RNA\u202f<1,318\u202fIU\/ml, were younger age 18-30 vs. 51-64\u202fyears (odds ratios [OR] 2.56; 95% CI 2.19-2.99), female vs. male sex (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.18-1.49), and advanced fibrosis stage F4 vs. F0-1 (OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.21-1.69). Only the younger age group had a decreased relative sensitivity below 95%, at 93.3%.We created and analysed a dataset from 12 countries with 66,640 participants with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. We determined that about 97% of those with viraemic infection had 1,300\u202fIU\/ml or more of circulating virus at the time of diagnosis. While current diagnostic tests can detect as little as 12\u202fIU\/ml of virus, our findings suggest that increasing the level of detection closer to 1,300\u202fIU\/ml would maintain good test accuracy and will likely enable development of more affordable portable tests for use in low- and middle-income countries.We established a multi-country cross-sectional dataset of first available quantitative HCV RNA measurements linked to demographic and clinical data.

One prevailing hypothesis is that people spend more time indoors in cooler weather, leading to increased spread of SARS-CoV-2 related to time spent in confined spaces and close contact with others. However, the evidence in support of that hypothesis is limited and, at times, conflicting. We use a mediation framework, and combine daily weather, COVID-19 hospital surveillance, cellphone-based mobility data and building footprints to estimate the relationship between daily indoor and outdoor weather conditions, mobility, and COVID-19 hospitalizations. We quantify the direct health impacts of weather on COVID-19 hospitalizations and the indirect effects of weather via time spent indoors away-from-home on COVID-19 hospitalizations within five Colorado counties between March 4th 2020 and January 31st 2021. We also evaluated the evidence for seasonal effect modification by comparing the results of all-season (using season as a covariate) to season-stratified models. Four weather conditions were associated with both time spent indoors away-from-home and 12-day lagged COVID-19 hospital admissions in one or more season: high minimum temperature (all-season), low maximum temperature (spring), low minimum absolute humidity (winter), and high solar radiation (all-season & winter). In our mediation analyses, we found evidence that changes in 12-day lagged hospital admissions were primarily via the direct effects of weather conditions, rather than via indirect effects by which weather changes time spent indoors away-from-home. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that weather impacted SARS-CoV-2 transmission via changes in mobility patterns during the first year of the pandemic. Rather, weather appears to have impacted SARS-CoV-2 transmission primarily via mechanisms other than human movement. We recommend further analysis of this phenomenon to determine whether these findings generalize to current SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, as well as other seasonal respiratory pathogens.","journal":"PloS one","reference":"Grover EN, Buchwald AG, Ghosh D, Carlton EJ.

We analyzed the data either ignoring data from the previous trial (i.e., weakly informative prior distributions) or using prior distributions incorporating the historical data into the analysis. We evaluated scenarios where efficacy in the new trial was the same, greater than, or less than that in the original trial. For each scenario, we evaluated the statistical power and type I error rate for estimating the vaccine effect following interim analyses.When we used a stringent threshold to control the type I error rate, analyses incorporating historical data had a small advantage over trials that did not. If control of type I error is less important (e.g., in a post-licensure evaluation), the incorporation of historical data can provide a substantial boost in efficiency.When a randomized controlled trial fails to demonstrate statistically significant efficacy against the primary endpoint, a potentially costly new trial would need to be conducted to receive licensure.

A set of cross-sectional models was first fitted to empirically compare disparities in COVID-19 health outcomes before and during the Omicron surge. Then, time-varying mediation analyses were employed to delineate how the effects of vaccine and mobility on COVID-19 health outcomes vary over time. Results showed that vaccine effectiveness against case rate lost significance during the Omicron surge, while its effectiveness against case-fatality rate remained significant throughout the pandemic. We also documented salient structural inequalities in COVID-19-related outcomes, with disadvantaged populations consistently bearing a larger brunt of case and death tolls, regardless of high vaccination rates.

Moreover, we show that the recurrence of the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan could be possible after the lifting of the state of emergency if there is no massive testing and quarantine.In this paper, we construct a mathematical model and discuss the effect of massive testing with quarantine, which would be less likely to affect the social and economic systems, and its efficacy has been proved in South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and Hong Kong.If we have entered into an explosive phase of the epidemic, the massive testing could be a strong tool to prevent the disease as long as the positively reacted individuals will be effectively quarantined, no matter whether the positive reaction is pseudo or not. Since total population could be seen as a superposition of smaller communities, we could understand how testing and quarantine policy might be powerful to control the disease.The pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread and caused enormous and serious damages to many countries worldwide. One of the most typical interventions is the social distancing such as lockdown that would contribute to reduce the number of contacts among undiagnosed individuals. However, prolongation of the period of such a restrictive intervention could hugely affect the social and economic systems, and the outbreak will come back if the strong social distancing policy will end earlier due to the economic damage. Therefore, the social distancing policy should be followed by massive testing accompanied with quarantine to eradicate the infection.","journal":"AIMS public health","reference":"Kuniya T, Inaba H.

PrEP scale-up strategies and clinical practice are currently being informed by modeling studies, which have estimated the impact of PrEP in adult and adolescent MSM populations separately. This partitioning may miss important effects or yield biased estimates by excluding dependencies between populations.PrEP use among eligible 19-39 year old MSM averted 29.0% of infections and reduced HIV prevalence from 23.2% to 17.0% over ten years in the population as a whole. Despite being ineligible for PrEP in this scenario, prevalence among sexually active 18 year-olds declined from 6.0% to 4.3% due to reduced transmissions across age cohorts. The addition of PrEP for adolescents ages 16-18 had a small impact on the overall epidemic, further reducing overall prevalence from 17.0% to 16.8%; however prevalence among the sexually active 18 year-olds further declined from 4.3% to 3.8%.We combined two published models of HIV transmission among adults and adolescent MSM. We simulated an HIV epidemic among MSM aged 13-39 without PrEP, with PrEP for adult MSM ages (19-39) and with the addition of PrEP for adolescents ages (16-18), comparing percent of incident infections averted (impact), the number of person-years on PrEP per infection averted (efficiency), and changes in prevalence.PrEP use among adults may significantly reduce HIV prevalence among MSM and may also have significant downstream effects on HIV incidence among adolescents; PrEP targeting adolescents remains an important intervention for HIV prevention.","journal":"PloS one","reference":"Hamilton DT, Rosenberg ES, Jenness SM, Sullivan PS, Wang LY, Dunville RL, Barrios LC, Aslam M, Goodreau SM.

Compared to no vaccination, routine infant vaccination at I$1\/dose was cost-saving in Delhi and Dong Thap, \"very cost-effective\" in Kolkata and Nairobi, and \"cost-effective\" in Lwak according to World Health Organization thresholds. However, routine vaccination was not the optimal strategy compared to strategies that included a catch-up campaign, which yielded the highest probability of being cost-saving in Delhi and Dong Thap and were most likely to provide a return on investment above a willingness-to-pay threshold of I$1440 in Kolkata, I$2300 in Nairobi, and I$5360 in Lwak. Vaccine price impacted the optimal strategy, and the number of doses required and rate of hospitalization were the primary sources of uncertainty.Typhoid fever remains endemic in low- and middle-income countries.

There are two types of structure in these networks, network structure and spatial structure. The network structure has been actively studied. The spatial structure of these networks has received attention only in recent years. Certainly little is known whether the two structures respond to each other. This study examines the scale effects, in terms of spatial extent, on the network structure and the spatial structure of spatially embedded contact networks. Two issues are explored, how the two types of structures change in response to scale changes, and the range of the scale effects. Two sets of areal units, regular grids with 24 different levels of spatial extent and census units of three levels of spatial extent, are used to divide one observed and two reference random networks into multiple scales. Six metrics are used to represent the two structures. Results show different scale effects. In terms of the network structure, the properties of the observed network are sensitive to scale changes at fine scales. In comparison, the clustered spatial structure of the network is scale independent. The behaviors of the network structure are affected by the spatial structure.

Several mechanistic models of cholera transmission have included rainfall as a driver by focusing on two possible transmission pathways: either by increasing exposure to contaminated water (e.g. due to worsening sanitary conditions during water excess), or water contamination by freshly excreted bacteria (e.g. due to washout of open-air defecation sites or overflows). Our study assesses the explanatory power of these different modeling structures by formal model comparison using deterministic and stochastic models of the type susceptible-infected-recovered-bacteria (SIRB). The incorporation of rainfall effects is generalized using a nonlinear function that can increase or decrease the relative importance of the large precipitation events. Our modelling framework is tested against the daily epidemiological data collected during the 2015 cholera outbreak within the urban context of Juba, South Sudan. This epidemic is characterized by a particular intra-seasonal double peak on the incidence in apparent relation with particularly strong rainfall events. Our results show that rainfall-based models in both their deterministic and stochastic formulations outperform models that do not account for rainfall. In fact, classical SIRB models are not able to reproduce the second epidemiological peak, thus suggesting that it was rainfall-driven. Moreover we found stronger support across model types for rainfall acting on increased exposure rather than on exacerbated water contamination. Although these results are context-specific, they stress the importance of a systematic and comprehensive appraisal of transmission pathways and their environmental forcings when embarking in the modelling of epidemic cholera.","journal":"Acta tropica","reference":"Lemaitre J, Pasetto D, Perez-Saez J, Sciarra C, Wamala JF, Rinaldo A.

As participants were recruited at different times leading to varying exposure to infection relative to entry, a modified proportional hazards model was developed to account for staggered entry into the studies and to quantify the correlation of titers with protection against influenza infections, adjusting for waning in titers. The model was fitted using Markov chain Monte Carlo and importance sampling.Correlations between hemagglutination-inhibition titers (hereafter \"titers\") and protection against infection have been identified in historical studies. However, limited information is available about the dynamics of how titer influences protection.A titer of 1:40 was associated with a reduced infection risk of 40%-70% relative to a titer of 1:10, depending on the circulating strain; the corresponding protection associated with a titer of 1:80 was 54%-84%. Results were robust across interpolation methods.

We constructed an infection-age-structured mathematical model that tracked the transmission rates over the course of infection and modelled the patients' life expectancy as a function of ART initiation timing. We fitted this model to the annual AIDS incidence and death data directly, and to resistance data and demographic data indirectly among men who have sex with men (MSM) in San Francisco. Using counterfactual scenarios, we assessed the impact on total and drug-resistant HIV incidence of ART initiation timing, frequency of acquired drug resistance, and second-line drug effectiveness (defined as the combination of resistance monitoring, biomedical drug efficacy and adherence). Earlier ART initiation could decrease the number of both total and drug-resistant HIV incidence when second-line drug effectiveness is sufficiently high (greater than 80%), but increase the proportion of new infections that are drug resistant.

Despite their comparable knowledge, significantly more seropositive pastoralists compared to mixed farmers engaged in risky practices including consuming unboiled milk (79.5% vs 1.7%, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and raw blood (28.3% vs 0.4%, p < 0.001), assisting in animal birth (43.0% vs 9.3%, p < 0.001), and handling raw hides (30.6% vs 5.5%, p < 0.001).The seroprevalence of brucellosis among nomadic pastoralists and their livestock in arid lands is reported to be over10-fold higher than non-pastoralists farmers and their livestock in Kenya. Here, we compared the seroprevalence of nomadic pastoralists and mixed farming with their knowledge of the disease and high-risk practices associated with brucellosis infection.Across-sectional study was conducted in two counties - Kiambu County where farmers primarily practice smallholder livestock production and crop farming, and Marsabit County where farmers practice nomadic pastoral livestock production. Stratified random sampling was applied, in which sublocations were initially selected based on predominant livestock production system, before selecting households using randomly generated geographical coordinates. In each household, up to three persons aged 5\u2009years and above were randomly selected, consented, and tested for Brucella spp IgG antibodies. A structured questionnaire was administered to the household head and selected individuals on disease knowledge and risky practices among the pastoralists and mixed farmers compared. Multivariable mixed effects logistic regression model was used to assess independent practices associated with human Brucella spp. IgG seropositivity.Nomadic pastoralists are more likely to engage in risky practices that promote Brucella Infection, probably because of their occupation and culture, despite having significant knowledge of the disease.","journal":"BMC public health","reference":"Njenga MK, Ogolla E, Thumbi SM, Ngere I, Omulo S, Muturi M, Marwanga D, Bitek A, Bett B, Widdowson MA, Munyua P, Osoro EM.

Here, we estimate the reproduction number throughout the epidemic in Chile and study the effectiveness of control interventions especially the effectiveness of lockdowns by conducting short-term forecasts based on the early transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Chile's incidence curve displays early sub-exponential growth dynamics with the deceleration of growth parameter, p, estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8) and the reproduction number, R, estimated at 1.8 (95% CI: 1.6, 1.9). Our findings indicate that the control measures at the start of the epidemic significantly slowed down the spread of the virus. However, the relaxation of restrictions and spread of the virus in low-income neighborhoods in May led to a new surge of infections, followed by the reimposition of lockdowns in Greater Santiago and other municipalities. These measures have decelerated the virus spread with R estimated at ~0.96 (95% CI: 0.95, 0.98) as of November 2nd, 2020. The early sub-exponential growth trend (p ~0.8) of the COVID-19 epidemic transformed into a linear growth trend (p ~0.5) as of July 7th, 2020, after the reimposition of lockdowns.

In 2032, improved screening access prevents 2.5 CRC deaths and 2.5 progressions per 100\u202fK people, with cumulative prevented 7\u202fK deaths and 9\u202fK progressions, respectively.

Given the importance of determining robust public health responses, we highlight the need to gather further data on symptom propagation, with our modelling framework acting as a template for future analysis.We propose a novel framework for incorporating different levels of symptom propagation into models of infectious disease transmission via a single parameter, \u03b1. Varying \u03b1 tunes the model from having no symptom propagation (\u03b1 = 0, as typically assumed) to one where symptoms always propagate (\u03b1 = 1). For parameters corresponding to three respiratory pathogens-seasonal influenza, pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2-we explored how symptom propagation impacted the relative epidemiological and health-economic performance of three interventions, conceptualised as vaccines with different actions: symptom-attenuating (labelled SA), infection-blocking (IB) and infection-blocking admitting only mild breakthrough infections (IB_MB). In the absence of interventions, with fixed underlying epidemiological parameters, stronger symptom propagation increased the proportion of cases that were severe. For SA and IB_MB, interventions were more effective at reducing prevalence (all infections and severe cases) for higher strengths of symptom propagation. For IB, symptom propagation had no impact on effectiveness, and for seasonal influenza this intervention type was more effective than SA at reducing severe infections for all strengths of symptom propagation. For pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2, at low intervention uptake, SA was more effective than IB for all levels of symptom propagation; for high uptake, SA only became more effective under strong symptom propagation. Health economic assessments found that, for SA-type interventions, the amount one could spend on control whilst maintaining a cost-effective intervention (termed threshold unit intervention cost) was very sensitive to the strength of symptom propagation.Respiratory pathogens inflict a substantial burden on public health and the economy. Although the severity of symptoms caused by these pathogens can vary from asymptomatic to fatal, the factors that determine symptom severity are not fully understood. Correlations in symptoms between infector-infectee pairs, for which evidence is accumulating, can generate large-scale clusters of severe infections that could be devastating to those most at risk, whilst also conceivably leading to chains of mild or asymptomatic infections that generate widespread immunity with minimal cost to public health. Although this effect could be harnessed to amplify the impact of interventions that reduce symptom severity, the mechanistic representation of symptom propagation within mathematical and health economic modelling of respiratory diseases is understudied.","journal":"PLoS computational biology","reference":"Asplin P, Keeling MJ, Mancy R, Hill EM.

We find that counties in the top CPVI quintile suffered almost double in regard to COVID-19 transmission (45.02% days with an R t higher than 1) from mobility, particularly intracounty mobility, compared to counties in the lowest quintile (21.90%). In contrast, counties in the bottom CPVI quintile were only slightly affected by the level of mobility. As such, a 25% intracounty mobility change was associated with a 15.28% R t change for counties in the top CPVI quintile, which is eight times the 1.81% R t change for those in the lowest quintile.

Multiple statistical methods for the estimation of the size of the susceptible (i.e., unvaccinated) population were applied to weekly reported measles case data on seven subprefectures throughout Lola. Stochastic compartmental models were used to project future measles incidence in each subprefecture in both an initial and a follow-up iteration of forecasting. Measles susceptibility among 1- to 5-year-olds was estimated to be between 24% and 43% at the beginning of the outbreak. Based on this high baseline susceptibility, initial projections forecasted a large outbreak occurring over approximately 10 weeks and infecting 40 children per 1,000. Subsequent forecasts based on updated data mitigated this initial projection, but still predicted a significant outbreak. A catch-up vaccination campaign took place at the same time as this second forecast and measles cases quickly receded. Of note, case reports used to fit models changed significantly between forecast rounds. Model-based projections of both current population risk and future incidence can help in setting priorities and planning during an outbreak response. A swiftly changing situation on the ground, coupled with data uncertainties and the need to adjust standard analytical approaches to deal with sparse data, presents significant challenges.

Accurate predictions of strains circulating in the future could therefore improve the vaccine match. Here, we studied the predictability of frequency dynamics and fixation of amino acid substitutions. Current frequency was the strongest predictor of eventual fixation, as expected in neutral evolution. Other properties, such as occurrence in previously characterized epitopes or high Local Branching Index (LBI) had little predictive power. Parallel evolution was found to be moderately predictive of fixation. Although the LBI had little power to predict frequency dynamics, it was still successful at picking strains representative of future populations. The latter is due to a tendency of the LBI to be high for consensus-like sequences that are closer to the future than the average sequence. Simulations of models of adapting populations, in contrast, show clear signals of predictability. This indicates that the evolution of influenza HA and NA, while driven by strong selection pressure to change, is poorly described by common models of directional selection such as traveling fitness waves.","journal":"Molecular biology and evolution","reference":"Barrat-Charlaix P, Huddleston J, Bedford T, Neher RA.

Future research should examine the etiologic relationships between the identified risk factors and human-to-human transmission of EVD with a focus on factors related to population mobility and healthcare accessibility, which are critical features of epidemic propagation and control.Although many studies have investigated the probability of Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks while other studies have simulated the size and speed of EVD outbreaks, few have investigated the environmental and population-level predictors of Ebola transmission once an outbreak is underway. Identifying strong predictors of transmission could help guide and target limited public health resources during an EVD outbreak. We examined several environmental and population-level demographic predictors of EVD risk from the West African epidemic.We obtained district-level estimates from the World Health Organization EVD case data, demographic indicators obtained from the Demographic and Health surveys, and satellite-derived temperature, rainfall, and land cover estimates. A Bayesian hierarchical Poisson model was used to estimate EVD risk and to evaluate the spatial variability explained by the selected predictors.\u00a0We found that districts had greater risk of EVD with increasing proportion of households not possessing a radio (RR 2.79, 0.90-8.78; RR 4.23, 1.16-15.93), increasing rainfall (RR 2.18; 0.66-7.20; 5.34, 1.20-23.90), and urban land cover (RR 4.87, 1.56-15.40; RR 5.74, 1.68-19.67).","journal":"PLoS currents","reference":"Zinszer K, Morrison K, Verma A, Brownstein JS.

A published study demonstrated that the circulation of one influenza virus type during early influenza season in the United States interferes with the activity of other influenza virus types. However, this finding has yet to be validated in other settings. In the present work, we investigated the interaction among seasonal influenza viruses (A\/H1N1, A\/H3N2 and B) in Japan. Sentinel and virus surveillance data were used to estimate the type-specific incidence from 2010 to 2019, and statistical correlations among the type-specific incidence were investigated. We identified significant negative correlations between incidence of the dominant virus and the complementary incidence. When correlation was identified during the course of an epidemic, a linear regression model accurately predicted the epidemic size of a particular virus type before the epidemic peak. The peak of influenza type B took place later in the season than that of influenza A, although the epidemic peaks of influenza A\/H1N1 and A\/H3N2 nearly coincided. Given the interaction among different influenza viruses, underlying mechanisms including age and spatial dependence should be explored in future.","journal":"International journal of environmental research and public health","reference":"Suzuki A, Mizumoto K, Akhmetzhanov AR, Nishiura H.

In an effort to understand how early action to find and control the virus is associated with cumulative outcomes, we explored how country-level testing capacity affects later COVID-19 mortality.Higher early testing implementation, as indicated by more cumulative tests per case when mortality was still low, was associated with a lower risk for higher per capita deaths. A sample finding indicated that a higher cumulative number of tests administered per case at the time of six deaths per million persons was associated with a lower risk of reaching 15 deaths per million persons, after adjustment for all confounders (HR\u2009=\u20090.909; P\u2009=\u20090.0001).We used the Our World in Data database to explore testing and mortality records in 27 countries from December 31, 2019, to September 30, 2020; we applied Cox proportional hazards regression to determine the relationship between early COVID-19 testing capacity (cumulative tests per case) and later COVID-19 mortality (time to specified mortality thresholds), adjusting for country-level confounders, including median age, GDP, hospital bed capacity, population density, and nonpharmaceutical interventions.Countries that developed stronger COVID-19 testing capacity at early timepoints, as measured by tests administered per case identified, experienced a slower increase of deaths per capita. Thus, this study operationalizes the value of testing and provides empirical evidence that stronger testing capacity at early timepoints is associated with reduced mortality and improved pandemic control.","journal":"Influenza and other respiratory viruses","reference":"Kannoth S, Kandula S, Shaman J.

We built a spreadsheet model to examine the potential demand for invasive mechanical ventilation (excluding \"rescue therapy\" ventilation). We considered scenarios of either 20% or 30% gross influenza clinical attack rate (CAR), with a \"low severity\" scenario with case fatality rates (CFR) of 0.05%-0.1%, or a \"high severity\" scenario (CFR: 0.25%-0.5%). We used rates-of-influenza-related illness to calculate the numbers of potential clinical cases, hospitalizations, admissions to intensive care units, and need for mechanical ventilation. We assumed 10 days ventilator use per ventilated patient, 13% of total ventilator demand will occur at peak, and a 33.7% weighted average mortality risk while on a ventilator. At peak, for a 20% CAR, low severity scenario, an additional 7000 to 11,000 ventilators will be needed, averting a pandemic total of 35,000 to 55,000 deaths. A 30% CAR, high severity scenario, will need approximately 35,000 to 60,500 additional ventilators, averting a pandemic total 178,000 to 308,000 deaths. Estimates of deaths averted may not be realized because successful ventilation also depends on sufficient numbers of suitably trained staff, needed supplies (eg, drugs, reliable oxygen sources, suction apparatus, circuits, and monitoring equipment) and timely ability to match access to ventilators with critically ill cases.

We used a case study of overdose prevention in Rhode Island to illustrate how these criteria could inform public health practice and health equity promotion. We used Rhode Island overdose mortality records from January 2016 to June 2020 (N=1,408) and neighborhood-level Census data. We learned two disparate machine learning models, Gaussian process and random forest, to illustrate the comparative utility of our criteria to guide interventions. Our models predicted 7.5-36.4% of overdose deaths during the test period, illustrating the preventive potential of overdose interventions assuming 5-20% statewide implementation capacities for neighborhood-level resource deployment.

Permutations of these were compared to adult-focused HIV testing coverage with condoms and TasP.The youth-focused strategy with ART treatment at diagnosis and condom use without adding interventions for HIV-negative youth performed better than the adult-focused strategy with adult testing reaching 50-60% coverage and TasP\/condoms. Over the long term, the youth-focused strategy approached the performance of 70% adult testing and TasP\/condoms. When high coverage male circumcision also is added to the youth-focused strategy, the combined intervention outperformed the adult-focused strategy with 70% testing, for at least 35 years by averting 94,000 more infections, averting 5.0 million more disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and saving US$46.0 million over this period. The addition of prevention interventions beyond circumcision to the youth-focused strategy would be more beneficial if HIV care costs are high, or when program delivery costs are relatively high for programs encompassing HIV testing coverage exceeding 70%, TasP and condoms to HIV-infected adults compared to combination prevention programs among youth.We compared the impact and costs of HIV prevention strategies focusing on youth (15-24 year-old persons) versus on adults (15+ year-old persons), in a high-HIV burden context of a large generalized epidemic.Compartmental age-structured mathematical model of HIV transmission in Nyanza, Kenya.For at least the next three decades, focusing in high burden settings on high coverage HIV testing, ART treatment upon diagnosis, condoms and male circumcision among youth may outperform adult-focused ART treatment upon diagnosis programs, unless the adult testing coverage in these programs reaches very high levels (>70% of all adults reached) at similar program costs.

It has been challenging to disentangle how population-level patterns of humoral immunity change as a function of age, calendar year, and birth cohort from cross-sectional data alone. We analyzed 1,589 longitudinal sera samples from 260 children across three studies in Nicaragua, 2006-16. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers were determined against four H3N2 strains, one H1N1 strain, and two H1N1pdm strains. We assessed temporal patterns of HAI titers using an age-period-cohort modeling framework. We found that titers against a given virus depended on calendar year of serum collection and birth cohort but not on age. Titer cohort patterns were better described by participants' ages relative to year of likely introduction of the virus's antigenic cluster than by age relative to year of strain introduction or by year of birth. These cohort effects may be driven by a decreasing likelihood of early-life infection after cluster introduction and by more broadly reactive antibodies at a young age. H3N2 and H1N1 viruses had qualitatively distinct cohort patterns, with cohort patterns of titers to specific H3N2 strains reaching their peak in children born 3 years prior to that virus's antigenic cluster introduction and with titers to H1N1 and H1N1pdm strains peaking for children born 1-2 years prior to cluster introduction but not being dramatically lower for older children. Ultimately, specific patterns of strain circulation and antigenic cluster introduction may drive population-level antibody titer patterns in children.","journal":"PLoS pathogens","reference":"Brouwer AF, Balmaseda A, Gresh L, Patel M, Ojeda S, Schiller AJ, Lopez R, Webby RJ, Nelson MI, Kuan G, Gordon A.

There is sparse evidence on single-dose protection, particularly in children. In 2020, a mass vaccination campaign was conducted in Uvira, an endemic urban setting in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, resulting in largely single-dose coverage. We examined the effectiveness of a single-dose of the oral cholera vaccine Euvichol-Plus in this high-burden setting.Wellcome Trust and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.We enrolled 658 individuals with confirmed cholera and 2274 matched individuals for the control group. 99 (15\u00b71%) individuals in the case group were younger than 5 years at the time of vaccination.

Although protection in the first 12-17 months after vaccination was similar for children aged 1-4 years and older individuals, the estimate of protection in children aged 1-4 years appeared to wane during the third year after vaccination (adjusted vaccine effectiveness 32\u00b79%, 95% CI -30\u00b77 to 65\u00b75), with CIs spanning the null.A single dose of Euvichol-Plus provided substantial protection against medically attended cholera for at least 36 months after vaccination in this cholera-endemic setting.

Poisson models fit with generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to estimate the association between social factors and the risk of influenza and pneumonia mortality. The Poisson model showed that influenza and pneumonia mortality increased, on average, by 32.2% for every 10% increase in illiteracy rate adjusted for population density, homeownership, unemployment, and age. We also found a significant association between transmissibility and population density, illiteracy, and unemployment but not homeownership. Lastly, analysis of the point locations of reported influenza and pneumonia deaths revealed fine-scale spatiotemporal clustering. This study shows that living in census tracts with higher illiteracy rates increased the risk of influenza and pneumonia mortality during the 1918 influenza pandemic in Chicago.

Though ND is vaccine-preventable, it is a persistent threat to poultry industry across the globe. The disease represents a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in chickens. To better understand the epidemiology of NDV among commercial and backyard chickens of Odisha, where chicken farming is being prioritized to assist with poverty alleviation, a cross-sectional study was conducted in two distinct seasons during 2018. Choanal swabs (n = 1361) from live birds (commercial layers, broilers, and backyard chicken) and tracheal tissues from dead birds (n = 10) were collected and tested by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the presence of matrix (M) and fusion (F) genes of NDV. Risk factors at the flock and individual bird levels (health status, ND vaccination status, geographical zone, management system, and housing) were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analyses. Of the 1371 samples tested, 160 were positive for M gene amplification indicating an overall apparent prevalence of 11.7% (95% CI 10.1-13.5%). Circulation of virulent NDV strains was also evident with apparent prevalence of 8.1% (13\/160; 95% CI: 4.8-13.4%). In addition, commercial birds had significantly higher odds (75%) of being infected with NDV as compared to backyard poultry (p = 0.01). This study helps fill a knowledge gap in the prevalence and distribution of NDV in apparently healthy birds in eastern India, and provides a framework for future longitudinal research of NDV risk and mitigation in targeted geographies-a step forward for effective control of ND in Odisha.","journal":"PloS one","reference":"Sahoo N, Bhuyan K, Panda B, Behura NC, Biswal S, Samal L, Chaudhary D, Bansal N, Singh R, Joshi VG, Jindal N, Mahajan NK, Maan S, Ravishankar C, Rajasekhar R, Radzio-Basu J, Herzog CM, Kapur V, Mor SK, Goyal SM.

Here, we present a patch-based differential equation modeling framework that extends the Ross-Macdonald model with sufficient skill and complexity to support planning, monitoring and evaluation for Plasmodium falciparum malaria control. We designed a generic interface for building structured, spatial models of malaria transmission based on a new algorithm for mosquito blood feeding. We developed new algorithms to simulate adult mosquito demography, dispersal, and egg laying in response to resource availability. The core dynamical components describing mosquito ecology and malaria transmission were decomposed, redesigned and reassembled into a modular framework. Structural elements in the framework-human population strata, patches, and aquatic habitats-interact through a flexible design that facilitates construction of ensembles of models with scalable complexity to support robust analytics for malaria policy and adaptive malaria control. We propose updated definitions for the human biting rate and entomological inoculation rates. We present new formulas to describe parasite dispersal and spatial dynamics under steady state conditions, including the human biting rates, parasite dispersal, the \"vectorial capacity matrix,\" a human transmitting capacity distribution matrix, and threshold conditions. An [Formula: see text] package that implements the framework, solves the differential equations, and computes spatial metrics for models developed in this framework has been developed.

To reduce disease transmission, policymakers can enforce reduced crowding and mandate wearing of masks. emph{Cohorting} -- forming groups of travelers that always travel together, is an additional policy to reduce disease transmission on textit{locals} without severe restrictions. Cohorting allows us to: ($i$) form traveler bubbles, thereby decreasing the number of distinct interactions over time; ($ii$) potentially quarantine an entire cohort if a single case is detected, making contact tracing more efficient, and ($iii$) target cohorts for testing and early detection of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic cases. Studying impact of cohorts using compartmental models is challenging because of the ensuing representational complexity. Agent-based models provide a natural way to represent cohorts along with the representation of the cohort members with the larger social network. This paper describes a novel multi-scale agent-based model to study the impact of cohorting strategies on COVID-19 dynamics in Mumbai. We achieve this by modeling the Mumbai urban region using a detailed agent-based model comprising of 12.4 million agents. Individual cohorts and their inter-cohort interactions as they travel on locals are modeled using local mean field approximations. The resulting multi-scale model in conjunction with a detailed disease transmission and intervention simulator is used to assess various cohorting strategies. The results provide a quantitative trade-off between cohort size and its impact on disease dynamics and well being. The results show that cohorts can provide significant benefit in terms of reduced transmission without significantly impacting ridership and or economic & social activity.","journal":"ArXiv","reference":"Talekar A, Shriram S, Vaidhiyan N, Aggarwal G, Chen J, Venkatramanan S, Wang L, Adiga A, Sadilek A, Tendulkar A, Marathe M, Sundaresan R, Tambe M.

A significant challenge in fitting Bayesian compartmental models lies in the need to estimate the duration of the infectious period, based on limited data providing only symptom onset date or another proxy for the start of infectiousness. Commonly, the exponential distribution is used to describe the infectious duration, an overly simplistic approach, which is not biologically plausible. More flexible distributions can be used, but parameter identifiability and computational cost can worsen for moderately sized or large epidemics. In this article, we present a novel approach, which considers a curve of transmissibility over a fixed infectious duration. The incorporation of infectious duration-dependent (IDD) transmissibility, which decays to zero during the infectious period, is biologically reasonable for many viral infections and fixing the length of the infectious period eases computational complexity in model fitting. Through simulation, we evaluate different functional forms of IDD transmissibility curves and show that the proposed approach offers improved estimation of the time-varying reproductive number. We illustrate the benefit of our approach through a new analysis of the 1995 outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease in the Democratic Republic of the\u00a0Congo.","journal":"Biometrical journal.

Smooth muscle cells exhibit a contractile function within the vaginal and cervical walls. Depending on the biochemical environment and the mechanical distension of the organ walls, the smooth muscle cells alter the contractile conditions. The contribution of the smooth muscle cells under baseline physiological conditions is classified as a basal tone. More specifically, a basal tone is the baseline partial constriction of smooth muscle cells in the absence of hormonal and neural stimulation. Furthermore, the ECM provides structural support for the organ walls and functions as a reservoir for biochemical cues. These biochemical cues are vital to various organ functions, such as inciting growth and maintaining homeostasis. The ECM of each organ is composed primarily of collagen fibers (mostly collagen types I, III, and V), elastic fibers, and glycosaminoglycans\/proteoglycans. The composition and organization of the ECM dictate the mechanical properties of each organ. A change in ECM composition may lead to the development of reproductive pathologies, such as pelvic organ prolapse or premature cervical remodeling. Furthermore, changes in ECM microstructure and stiffness may alter smooth muscle cell activity and phenotype, thus resulting in the loss of the contractile force. In this work, the reported protocols are used to assess the basal tone and passive mechanical properties of the nonpregnant murine vagina and cervix at 4-6 months of age in estrus. The organs were mounted in a commercially available pressure myograph and both pressure-diameter and force-length tests were performed. Sample data and data analysis techniques for the mechanical characterization of the reproductive organs are included. Such information may be useful for constructing mathematical models and rationally designing therapeutic interventions for women's health pathologies.","journal":"Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE","reference":"White SE, Conway CK, Clark GL, Lawrence DJ, Bayer CL, Miller KS.

In the second and predominant phase extending from late February to mid-March, unrestricted movements between countries outside of China facilitated intercontinental spread, with Europe as a major source. Phylogenetic analyses also revealed that the dominant strains circulating in the United States of America were introduced from Europe.

This is of vital importance for informing current and future pandemic response strategies.Our analyses highlight that heterogeneities in international travel have shaped the spatiotemporal characteristics of the pandemic.

An evolutionary hypothesis.","abstract":"We adapted a previously published model of HIV transmission and evolution (EvoNetHIV), parameterized here for men who have sex with men (MSM). We conducted a series of simulation experiments that vary seven behavioral or clinical parameters that affect exposure risk as people age. We conducted regressions to determine the mean increase in SPVL per 10-year increase in seroconversion age, with and without source SPVL in the model.Set-point viral load (SPVL) correlates with the age at which people acquire HIV. Although immunosenescence may seem like a parsimonious explanation for this, it does not easily explain the observation that the relationship between age and SPVL attenuates when accounting for source partner SPVL. Here we propose an alternative explanation that encompasses this latter finding: that decreasing risk of acquisition with older age generates a selection bottleneck that selects for more virulent strains with age.All runs generated significant relationships between seroconversion age and SPVL when not including source SPVL. All saw attenuated relationships, most to near 0, with source SPVL included. Four of our behavioral measures (relational duration, age-related homophily, coital frequency, and mean age at relationship formation) had clear effects on this relationship, all in the hypothesized direction. Combining multiple forms of behavioral heterogeneity yielded an increase of 0.056 log10 copies\/mL SPVL per 10-year increase in seroconversion age, nearly as large as that seen in two empirical studies of age-SPVL correlations in MSM.The higher virulence of HIV among those infected later in life may be partly explained by a combination of selective bottlenecks and behavioral heterogeneity by age. Variation in the strength of this effect across populations may be in part due to different behavioral, epidemiological and clinical conditions, and not require assumptions about differences in patterns of immunosenescence among populations.","journal":"Epidemics","reference":"Goodreau SM, Stansfield SE, Mittler JE, Murphy JT, Abernethy NF, Gottlieb GS, Reid MC, Burke JC, Pollock ED, Herbeck JT.

This is a manifestation of a wider population phenomenon known as \"frailty variation\". Despite theoretical understanding, public health policies continue to be guided by mathematical models that leave out considerable variation and as a result inflate projected disease burdens and overestimate the impact of interventions. Here we focus on trajectories of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in England and Scotland until November 2021. We fit models to series of daily deaths and infer relevant epidemiological parameters, including coefficients of variation and effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions which we find in agreement with independent empirical estimates based on contact surveys. Our estimates are robust to whether the analysed data series encompass one or two pandemic waves and enable projections compatible with subsequent dynamics.

Low transmission settings are characterised by high levels of spatial heterogeneity, which stands in stark contrast to the widely used assumption of spatially homogeneous transmission used in mathematical transmission models for malaria. In the present study an individual-based mathematical malaria transmission model that incorporates multiple parasite clones, variable human exposure and duration of infection, limited mosquito flight distance and most importantly geographically heterogeneous human and mosquito population densities was used to illustrate the differences between homogeneous and heterogeneous transmission assumptions when aiming to predict surrogate indicators of transmission intensity such as population parasite prevalence or multiplicity of infection (MOI). In traditionally highly malaria endemic regions where most of the population harbours malaria parasites, humans are often infected with multiple parasite clones. However, studies have shown also in areas with low overall parasite prevalence, infection with multiple parasite clones is a common occurrence. Mathematical models assuming homogeneous transmission between humans and mosquitoes cannot explain these observations. Heterogeneity of transmission can arise from many factors including acquired immunity, body size and occupational exposure. In this study, we show that spatial heterogeneity has a profound effect on predictions of MOI and parasite prevalence. We illustrate, that models assuming homogeneous transmission underestimate average MOI in low transmission settings when compared to field data and that spatially heterogeneous models predict stable transmission at much lower overall parasite prevalence. Therefore it is very important that models used to guide malaria surveillance and control strategies in low transmission and elimination settings take into account the spatial features of the specific target area, including human and mosquito vector distribution.","journal":"PloS one","reference":"Karl S, White MT, Milne GJ, Gurarie D, Hay SI, Barry AE, Felger I, Mueller I.

While previous studies have considered optimal coverage of animal rabies vaccination, variation in the frequency of vaccination campaigns has not been explored. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of rabies canine vaccination campaigns at varying coverage and frequency, we parametrized a rabies virus transmission model to two districts of northwest Tanzania, Ngorongoro (pastoral) and Serengeti (agro-pastoral). We found that optimal vaccination strategies were every 2 years, at 80% coverage in Ngorongoro and annually at 70% coverage in Serengeti. We further found that the optimality of these strategies was sensitive to the rate of rabies reintroduction from outside the district. Specifically, if a geographically coordinated campaign could reduce reintroduction, vaccination campaigns every 2 years could effectively manage rabies in both districts. Thus, coordinated campaigns may provide monetary savings in addition to public health benefits. Our results indicate that frequency and coverage of canine vaccination campaigns should be evaluated simultaneously and tailored to local canine ecology as well as to the risk of disease reintroduction from surrounding regions.","journal":"Proceedings.

This study examines the variability of a previously identified resistance pattern in Escherichia coli among ampicillin, gentamicin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline using samples isolated from chicken during the years 2004 to 2006 and 2008 to 2012. 2007 is excluded because sulfisozaxole resistance was not measured at slaughter that year. To assess variability in this resistance pattern susceptibility\/resistance contingency tables were constructed for each of the 15 combinations of the 4 drugs for each of the years. For each table, variability across the years was assessed at the full table multinomial level as a measure of general variability of the resistance pattern and at the level of the highest order interaction term in a log-linear model of the table as a measure of variability in that particular component of the resistance pattern. A power analysis using the traditional asymptotic normal approximation and one using a Dirichlet-multinomial simulation were carried out to determine the effect of variation on ability to detect nonzero highest order loglinear model terms and the validity of the normal approximation in carrying out such tests. All tables exhibit overdispersion at the multinomial level and in their highest order model parameters. The normal approximation performs well for large sample sizes, low levels of dispersion, and small log-linear model parameters. The approximation breaks down as dispersion or the log linear model parameter grows or sample size shrinks. Taken together these analyses indicate that the level of variability in the NARMS dataset makes it difficult to detect multidrug resistance patterns at the current level of sample collection. In order to better control this dispersion NARMS could collect more variables on each of the samples.","journal":"Preventive veterinary medicine","reference":"Zawack K, Love WJ, Lanzas C, Booth JG, Gr\u00f6hn YT.

To facilitate pollution control efforts, the National Academy of Sciences and the World Health Organization have prioritized determining which air pollutants are most toxic. However, evidence is limited for the simultaneous effects of multiple air pollutants on stroke.We constructed a nationwide population-based cohort study, using the Medicare Chronic Conditions Warehouse (2000-2017) and high-resolution air pollution data, to investigate the impact of long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5, NO2, and ground-level O3 on incident stroke. Hazard ratios (HR) for stroke incidence were estimated using single-, bi-, and tri-pollutant Cox proportional hazards models. We identified ~2.2 million incident stroke cases among 17,443,900 fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries. Per interquartile range (IQR) increase in the annual average PM2.5 (3.7 \u03bcg\/m3), NO2 (12.4 ppb), and warm-season O3 (6.5 ppb) one-year prior to diagnosis, the HRs were 1.022 (95% CI: 1.017-1.028), 1.060 (95% CI: 1.054-1.065), and 1.021 (95% CI: 1.017-1.024), respectively, from the tri-pollutant model. There was strong evidence of linearity in concentration-response relationships for all three air pollutants in single-pollutant models. This linear relationship remained robust for NO2 and O3 in tri-pollutant models while the effect of PM2.5 attenuated at the lower end of concentrations.","journal":"Global epidemiology","reference":"Ma T, Yazdi MD, Schwartz J, R\u00e9quia WJ, Di Q, Wei Y, Chang HH, Vaccarino V, Liu P, Shi L.

The American Society of Hematology guidelines recommend rituximab over splenectomy, TRAs over rituximab, and splenectomy or TRAs while noting a lack of evidence on the cost-effectiveness of these therapies. Using prospective, observational, and meta-analytic data, we performed the first cost-effectiveness analysis of second-line therapies in chronic ITP, from the perspective of the U.S. health system. Over a 20-year time-horizon, our six-strategy Markov model shows that a strategy incorporating early splenectomy, an approach at odds with current guidelines and clinical practice, is the cost-effective strategy. All four strategies utilizing TRAs in the first or second position cost over $1 million per quality-adjusted life-year, as compared to strategies involving early use of splenectomy and rituximab. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, early use of splenectomy and rituximab in either order was favored in 100% of 10\u00a0000 iterations. The annual cost of TRAs would have to decrease over 80% to begin to become cost-effective in any early TRA strategy. Our data indicate that effectiveness of early TRA and late TRA strategies is similar with the cost significantly greater with early TRA strategies. Contrary to current practice trends and guidelines, early use of splenectomy and rituximab, rather than TRAs, constitutes cost-effective treatment in adults with chronic ITP.","journal":"American journal of hematology","reference":"Goshua G, Sinha P, Kunst N, Pischel L, Lee AI, Cuker A.

Here, we study dengue virus (DENV) transmission across the ecologically and demographically distinct regions or Ecuador. We analyzed province-level age-stratified dengue incidence data from 2000-2019 using catalytic models to estimate the force of infection of DENV over eight decades. We found that provinces established endemic DENV transmission at different time periods. Coastal provinces with the largest and most connected cities had the earliest and highest increase in DENV transmission, starting around 1980 and continuing to the present. In contrast, remote and rural areas with reduced access, like the northern coast and the Amazon regions, experienced a rise in DENV transmission and endemicity only in the last 10 to 20 years. The newly introduced chikungunya and Zika viruses have age-specific distributions of hospital-seeking cases consistent with recent emergence across all provinces. To evaluate factors associated with geographic differences in DENV transmission potential, we modeled the DENV vector risk using 11,693 Aedes aegypti presence points to the resolution of 1 hectare. In total, 56% of the population of Ecuador, including in provinces identified as having increasing DENV transmission in our models, live in areas with high risk of Aedes aegypti, with population size, trash collection, elevation, and access to water as important determinants. Our investigation serves as a case study of the changes driving the expansion of DENV and other arboviruses globally and suggest that control efforts should be expanded to semi-urban and rural areas and to historically isolated regions to counteract increasing dengue outbreaks.","journal":"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","reference":"Katzelnick LC, Quentin E, Colston S, Ha TA, Andrade P, Eisenberg JNS, Ponce P, Coloma J, Cevallos V.

We applied machine learning algorithms on the simulation outputs to examine the importance of each intervention parameter and the feasible intervention parameter combinations for safe exits, which is defined as having mortality rates lower than that of influenza in China (14.3 per 100, 000 persons).The analytical framework developed here can provide the basis for further policy decisions that incorporate considerations about economic costs and societal impacts. Achieving safe exits from the Zero-COVID policy is possible, but challenging for China's cities.

During the epidemic in 2015-16, ZIKV spread through the Americas and quickly joined the list of other known teratogenic pathogens, TORCH. Multiple ZIKV vaccines have been developed for protection of pregnant women and women of childbearing age. However, ZIKV infection incidence has since waned substantially, and adverse birth outcomes are rare outcomes of infection. Studying a vaccine's protective efficacy against CZS in a large phase III clinical trial may be infeasible in such times of low incidence. Should trials be initiated, researchers may resort to alternative clinical endpoints. In this study, we simulate a variety of vaccine clinical trial scenarios to evaluate the feasibility of the CZS endpoint in vaccine studies and compare CZS to other potential outcomes: ZIKV infection detected through weekly, biweekly, or monthly testing and laboratory-confirmed, symptomatic Zika Virus Disease. We compare the sample size required for 80% statistical power to detect vaccine efficacy and trial duration for each scenario. Our results show the feasibility of CZS clinical endpoints depends on the timing of simulated clinical trials in the course of a seasonal epidemic, due to CZS risk varying with trimester of infection. This result highlights additional considerations needed when designing vaccine efficacy trials of protection against teratogenic pathogens.","journal":"Vaccine","reference":"Mercaldo RA, Bellan SE.

Machine learning-based population estimates are an attractive option but have not been validated for use in epidemiologic studies. Treating 2010 decennial census counts as a \"ground truth\", we conduct a case study to compare the performance of alternative small-area population denominator estimates from surrounding years for modeling real-time disease incidence rates. Our case study focuses on modeling health disparities in census tract incidence rates in Massachusetts, using population size estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS), the most commonly-used intercensal small-area population data in epidemiology, and WorldPop, a machine learning model for high-resolution population size estimation. Through simulation studies and an analysis of real premature mortality data, we evaluate whether WorldPop denominators can provide improved performance relative to ACS for quantifying disparities using both census tract-aggregate and race-stratified modeling approaches. We find that biases induced in parameter estimates due to temporally incompatible incidence and denominator data tend to be larger for race-stratified models than for area-aggregate models. In most scenarios considered here, WorldPop denominators lead to greater bias in estimates of health disparities than ACS denominators. These insights will assist researchers in intercensal years to select appropriate population size estimates for modeling disparities in real-time disease incidence. We highlight implications for health disparity studies in the coming decade, as 2020 census counts may introduce new sources of error.","journal":"SSM - population health","reference":"Nethery RC, Rushovich T, Peterson E, Chen JT, Waterman PD, Krieger N, Waller L, Coull BA.

In this study we critically examine the basis for that hope, using an epidemiological modeling framework to establish the link between vaccine characteristics and effectiveness in bringing an end to this unprecedented public health crisis. Our findings suggest that a return to pre-pandemic social and economic conditions without fully suppressing SARS-CoV-2 will lead to extensive viral spread, resulting in a high disease burden even in the presence of vaccines that reduce risk of infection and mortality. Our modeling points to the feasibility of complete SARS-CoV-2 suppression with high population-level compliance and vaccines that are highly effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Machine learning techniques are used in a novel manner to capture model variability and analyse parameter sensitivity. We applied the framework to understand the spread of a devastating pest of tomato, Tuta absoluta, in South and Southeast Asia, a region at the frontier of its current range. Analysis with respect to historical invasion records suggests that even with modest self-mediated spread capabilities, the pest can quickly expand its range through domestic city-to-city vegetable trade.

Further investigation into convalescent plasma is warranted until data on its effectiveness specifically in treating COVID-19 becomes available. The success of supportive or curative clinical interventions will depend on earlier treatment seeking, such that community engagement and risk communication will be critical components of the response.Across SSA, deceased cases for which demographic data were available were predominantly male (63\/103, 61.2%) and aged >50 years (59\/75, 78.7%). In Burkina Faso, specifically, the majority of deceased cases either did not seek care at all or were hospitalized for a single day (59.4%, 19\/32). Hypertension and diabetes were often reported as underlying conditions. After adjustment for sex, age and underlying conditions in the synthetic case population, the odds of mortality for cases not receiving oxygen therapy were significantly higher than for those receiving oxygen, such as due to disruptions to standard care (OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.56-2.75). Cases receiving convalescent plasma had 50% reduced odds of mortality than those who did not (95% CI 0.24-0.93).Data from deceased cases reported across SSA through 10 May 2020 and from hospitalized cases in Burkina Faso through 15 April 2020 were analyzed. Demographic, epidemiological and clinical information on deceased cases in SSA was derived through a line-list of publicly available information and, for cases in Burkina Faso, from aggregate records at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Tengandogo in Ouagadougou. A synthetic case population was probabilistically derived using distributions of age, sex and underlying conditions from populations of West African countries to assess individual risk factors and treatment effect sizes. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the adjusted odds of survival for patients receiving oxygen therapy or convalescent plasma, based on therapeutic effectiveness observed for other respiratory illnesses.Absolute numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported to date in the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region have been significantly lower than those across the Americas, Asia and Europe. As a result, there has been limited information about the demographic and clinical characteristics of deceased cases in the region, as well as the impacts of different case management strategies.","journal":"International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases","reference":"Skrip L, Derra K, Kabor\u00e9 M, Noori N, Gansan\u00e9 A, Val\u00e9a I, Tinto H, Brice BW, Gordon MV, Hagedorn B, Hien H, Althouse BM, Wenger EA, Ouedraogo AL.

In addition, for some pathogens such as dengue virus, poorly targeted immunity is associated with increased risk of severe disease, through a mechanism known as antibody-dependent enhancement. However, it remains a mystery whether the antigenic distance between an individual's first infection and subsequent exposures dictate disease risk, explaining the observed large-scale differences in dengue hospitalisations across years. Here we develop an inferential framework that combines detailed antigenic and genetic characterisation of viruses, and hospitalised cases from 21 years of surveillance in Bangkok, Thailand to identify the role of the antigenic profile of circulating viruses in determining disease risk. We find that the risk of hospitalisation depends on both the specific order of infecting serotypes and the antigenic distance between an individual's primary and secondary infections, with risk maximised at intermediate antigenic distances. These findings suggest immune imprinting helps determine dengue disease risk, and provides a pathway to monitor the changing risk profile of populations and to quantifying risk profiles of candidate vaccines.","journal":"Research square","reference":"Wang L, Huang AT, Katzelnick LC, Lefrancq N, Escoto AC, Duret L, Chowdhury N, Jarman R, Conte MA, Berry IM, Fernandez S, Klungthong C, Thaisomboonsuk B, Suntarattiwong P, Vandepitte W, Whitehead S, Cauchemez S, Cummings DAT, Salje H.

Centrality measures are well-known methods used to quantify the influence of nodes by extracting information from the network's structure. The pitfall of these measures is to pinpoint nodes located in the vicinity of each other, saturating their shared zone of influence. In this paper, we propose a ranking strategy exploiting the ubiquity of the community structure in real-world networks. The proposed community-aware ranking strategy naturally selects a set of distant spreaders with the most significant influence in the networks. One can use it with any centrality measure. We investigate its effectiveness using real-world and synthetic networks with controlled parameters in a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) diffusion model scenario. Experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed ranking strategy over all its counterparts agnostic about the community structure. Additionally, results show that it performs better in networks with a strong community structure and a high number of communities of heterogeneous sizes.","journal":"PloS one","reference":"Rajeh S, Cherifi H.

However, the effectiveness of school closure and internal movement restrictions appears robust across different model specifications, with some evidence that other NPIs may also be effective under particular conditions. This provides empirical evidence for the potential effectiveness of many, although not all, actions policy-makers are taking to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic., levels of NPI intensity, time-varying changes in NPI effect, and variable selection criteria. Results were interpreted taking into account both the range of model specifications and temporal clustering of NPIs.. Another three NPIs (workplace closure, income support, and debt\/contract relief) had strong evidence of effectiveness when ignoring their level of intensity, while two NPIs (public events cancellation, restriction on gatherings) had strong evidence of their effectiveness only when evaluating their implementation at maximum capacity (e.g. restrictions on 1000+ people gathering were not effective, restrictions on <\u200910 people gathering were). Evidence about the effectiveness of the remaining NPIs (stay-at-home requirements, public information campaigns, public transport closure, international travel controls, testing, contact tracing) was inconsistent and inconclusive. We found temporal clustering between many of the NPIs. Effect sizes varied depending on whether or not we included data after peak NPI intensity.Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are used to reduce transmission of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Empirical studies that use microfluidic chemotaxis-chip devices with two opposing chemoattractants showed differential neutrophil migration after challenge with different LPS doses. The epigenetic alterations responsible for changes in neutrophil migratory behavior are unknown. We developed two mathematical models that evaluate the mechanistic interactions responsible for neutrophil migratory decision-making when exposed to competing chemoattractants and challenged with LPS. The first model, which considers the interactions between the receptor densities of two competing chemoattractants, their kinases, and LPS, displayed bistability between high and low ratios of primary to intermediary chemoattractant receptor densities. In particular, at equilibrium, we observe equal receptor densities for low LPS ( 15ng\/mL). The second model, which included additional interactions with an extracellular signal-regulated kinase in both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms, has an additional dynamic outcome, oscillatory dynamics for both receptors, as seen in the data. In particular, it found equal receptor densities in the absence of oscillation for super-low and high LPS challenge (< 0.4 and 1.1 <LPS< 375 ng\/mL); equal receptor densities with oscillatory receptor dynamics for super-low LPS (0.5 < LPS376 ng\/mL). Predicting the mechanisms and the type of external LPS challenge responsible for neutrophils migration toward pro-inflammatory chemoattractants, migration toward pro-tolerant chemoattractants, or oscillatory movement is necessary knowledge in designing interventions against immune diseases, such as sepsis.","journal":"Frontiers in genetics","reference":"Ciupe SM, Boribong BP, Kadelka S, Jones CN.

We estimated expected mortality without the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic by fitting models to observed mortality time series during the pre-pandemic period, with stratification by age and sex. Additionally, we considered three periods of interest: the first 4 weeks of India's first lockdown (March 24 to April 20, 2020), the 4-month period including the first wave of the pandemic in Chennai (May 1 to Aug 31, 2020), and the 4-month period including the second wave of the pandemic in Chennai (March 1 to June 30, 2021). We computed the difference between observed and expected mortality from March 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021, and compared pandemic-associated mortality across socioeconomically distinct communities (measured with use of 2011 census of India data) with regression analyses.India has been severely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to shortcomings in disease surveillance, the burden of mortality associated with COVID-19 remains poorly understood. We aimed to assess changes in mortality during the pandemic in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, using data on all-cause mortality within the district.Between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021, 87\u2009870 deaths were registered in areas of Chennai district represented by the 2011 census, exceeding expected deaths by 25\u2009990 (95% uncertainty interval 25\u2009640-26\u2009360) or 5\u00b718 (5\u00b711-5\u00b725) excess deaths per 1000 people. Stratified by age, excess deaths numbered 21\u00b702 (20\u00b754-21\u00b749) excess deaths per 1000 people for individuals aged 60-69 years, 39\u00b774 (38\u00b773-40\u00b769) for those aged 70-79 years, and 96\u00b790 (93\u00b735-100\u00b716) for those aged 80 years or older. Neighbourhoods with lower socioeconomic status had 0\u00b77% to 2\u00b78% increases in pandemic-associated mortality per 1 SD increase in each measure of community disadvantage, due largely to a disproportionate increase in mortality within these neighbourhoods during the second wave. Conversely, differences in excess mortality across communities were not clearly associated with socioeconomic status measures during the first wave. For each increase by 1 SD in measures of community disadvantage, neighbourhoods had 3\u00b76% to 8\u00b76% lower pandemic-associated mortality during the first 4 weeks of India's country-wide lockdown, before widespread SARS-CoV-2 circulation was underway in Chennai.

We used information from a subset of this cohort to derive two clinical prediction tools that identify contacts of TB patients at elevated risk of progressing to active disease by training multivariable models that predict (1) co-prevalent TB among all household contacts and (2) one-year incident TB among adult contacts. We validated the models in a geographically distinct sub-cohort and compared the relative utilities of clinical decisions based on these tools to existing strategies.In our cohort, 296 (2.1%) household contacts had co-prevalent TB and 145 (1.9%) adult contacts developed incident TB within one year of index patient diagnosis. We predicted co-prevalent disease using information that could be readily obtained at the time an index patient was diagnosed and predicted one-year incident TB by including additional contact-specific characteristics.

Given extensive epistatic interactions within viral genomes and known viral evolutionary history, efficient genomic surveillance necessitates early detection of emerging viral haplotypes rather than commonly targeted single mutations. Haplotype inference, however, is a significantly more challenging problem precluding the use of traditional approaches. Here, using SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary dynamics as a case study, we show that emerging haplotypes with altered transmissibility can be linked to dense communities in coordinated substitution networks, which become discernible significantly earlier than the haplotypes become prevalent.

Research on dust storm's health impacts in the US is limited and hindered by challenges in dust storm identification. This study assesses the potential link between dust storms and cardiorespiratory emergency department (ED) visits in the southwestern US. We acquired data for 2005-2016 from eight IMPROVE (Interagency Monitoring of PROtected Visual Environments) sites in Arizona, California, and Utah. We applied a validated algorithm to identify dust storm days at each site. We acquired patient-level ED visit data from state agencies and ascertained visits for respiratory, cardiovascular, and cause-specific subgroups among patients residing in ZIP codes within 50 km of an IMPROVE site. Using a case-crossover design, we estimated short-term associations of ED visits and dust storms, controlling for temporally varying covariates. During 2005-2016, 40 dust storm days occurred at the eight IMPROVE sites. Mean PM10 and PM2.5 levels were three to six times greater on dust storm days compared to non-dust storm days. Over the study period, there were 2 524 259 respiratory and 2 805 925 cardiovascular ED visits.

Estimated associations of dust storm days and cardiovascular disease ED visits were largely consistent with the null. Using a monitoring-based exposure metric, we observed associations among dust storms and respiratory ED visits. The results add to growing evidence of the health threat posed by dust storms.

Although this variation is fundamental to disease ecology, little is known about the evolutionary pressures that drive these differences, particularly where they interact with host behaviour. We hypothesized that host behaviours relevant to different transmission routes give rise to differences in contact network structure, constraining the space over which pathogen traits can evolve to maximize fitness. Our analysis of 232 contact networks across mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, arthropods, fish and molluscs found that contact network topology varies by contact type, most notably in networks that are representative of fluid-exchange transmission. Using infectious disease model simulations, we showed that these differences in network structure suggest pathogens transmitted through fluid-exchange contact types will need traits associated with high transmissibility to successfully proliferate, compared to pathogens that transmit through other types of contact. These findings were supported through a review of known traits of pathogens that transmit in humans. Our work demonstrates that contact network structure may drive the evolution of compensatory pathogen traits according to transmission strategy, providing essential context for understanding pathogen evolution and ecology.","journal":"Proceedings.

Immunization is an important problem in multiple areas especially epidemiology and public health. However, most existing studies focus on developing pre-emptive strategies assuming prior epidemiological models. In practice, disease spread is usually complicated, hence assuming an underlying model may deviate from true spreading patterns, leading to possibly inaccurate interventions. Additionally, the abundance of health care surveillance data (like eHRC) makes it possible to study data-driven strategies without too many restrictive assumptions. Hence, such an approach can help public-health experts take more practical decisions. In this paper, we take into account propagation log and contact networks for controlling propagation. We formulate the novel and challenging Data-Driven Immunization problem without assuming classical epidemiological models. To solve it, we first propose an efficient sampling approach to align surveillance data with contact networks, then develop an efficient algorithm with the provably approximate guarantee for immunization. Finally, we show the effectiveness and scalability of our methods via extensive experiments on multiple datasets, and conduct case studies on nation-wide real medical surveillance data.","journal":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)","reference":"Yao Zhang, Arvind Ramanathan, Anil Vullikanti, Laura Pullum, B Aditya Prakash.

While changes in diversity are known to dramatically change species interactions and alter disease dynamics, the effects of phylogenetic changes in host and vector communities on disease have been relatively poorly studied. Using a theoretical model, we investigated how phylogeny and extinction influence network structural characteristics relevant to disease transmission in disturbed environments. We modelled a multi-host, multi-vector community as a bipartite ecological network, where nodes represent host and vector species and edges represent connections among them through vector feeding, and we simulated vector preferences and threat status on host and parasite phylogenies. We then simulated loss of hosts, including phylogenetically clustered losses, to investigate how extinction influences network structure. We compared effects of phylogeny and extinction to those of host specificity, which we predicted to strongly increase network modularity and reduce disease prevalence. The simulations revealed that extinction often increased modularity, with higher modularity as species loss increased, although not as much as increasing host specificity did. These results suggest that extinction itself, all else being equal, may reduce disease prevalence in disturbed communities. However, in real communities, systematic patterns in species loss (e.g. favoring high competence species) or changes in abundance may counteract these effects. Unexpectedly, we found that effects of phylogenetic signal in host and vector traits were relatively weak, and only important when phylogenetic signal of host and vector traits were similar, or when these traits both varied.","journal":"PloS one","reference":"Nunn CL, Vining AQ, Chakraborty D, Reiskind MH, Young HS.

Animal-to-human transmission occurs upon exposure to rodent excreta and secretions, i.e. urine and saliva, and human-to-human transmission occurs via the bodily fluids of an infected person. To elucidate the seasonal drivers of LF epidemics, we employed a mathematical model to analyse the datasets of human infection, rodent population dynamics and climatological variations and capture the underlying transmission dynamics. The surveillance-based incidence data of human cases in Nigeria were explored, and moreover, a mathematical model was used for describing the transmission dynamics of LF in rodent populations. While quantifying the case fatality risk and the rate of exposure of humans to animals, we explicitly estimated the corresponding contact rate of humans with infected rodents, accounting for the seasonal population dynamics of rodents. Our findings reveal that seasonal migratory dynamics of rodents play a key role in regulating the cyclical pattern of LF epidemics. The estimated timing of high exposure of humans to animals coincides with the time shortly after the start of the dry season and can be associated with the breeding season of rodents in Nigeria.

A total of 626,000 SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported in 99.5% (215\/216) of the subdistricts of Shanghai until the end of May. The spatial distribution of the infections was highly heterogeneous, with 37% of the subdistricts accounting for 80% of all infections. A clear trend from the city center towards adjacent suburban and rural areas was observed, with a progressive slowdown of the epidemic spread (from 463 to 244 meters\/day) prior to the citywide lockdown. During Phase 2, Rt remained well above 1 despite the implementation of multiple targeted interventions. The citywide lockdown imposed on April 1 led to a marked decrease in transmission, bringing Rt below the epidemic threshold in the entire city on April 14 and ultimately leading to containment of the outbreak.In early March 2022, a major outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant spread rapidly throughout Shanghai, China. Here we aimed to provide a description of the epidemiological characteristics and spatiotemporal transmission dynamics of the Omicron outbreak under the population-based screening and lockdown policies implemented in Shanghai.We extracted individual information on SARS-CoV-2 infections reported between January 1 and May 31, 2022, and on the timeline of the adopted non-pharmaceutical interventions. The epidemic was divided into three phases: i) sporadic infections (January 1-February 28), ii) local transmission (March 1-March 31), and iii) city-wide lockdown (April 1 to May 31). We described the epidemic spread during these three phases and the subdistrict-level spatiotemporal distribution of the infections.
