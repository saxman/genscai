      "Paper Abstract: Background: Since the appearance of the first case of COVID-19 in Morocco, the cumulative number of reported infectious cases continues to increase and, consequently, the government imposed the containment measure within the country. Our aim is to predict the impact of the compulsory containment on COVID-19 spread. Earlier knowledge of the epidemic characteristics of COVID-19 transmission related to Morocco will be of great interest to establish an optimal plan-of-action to control the epidemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Method: Using a Susceptible-Asymptomatic-Infectious model and the data of reported cumulative confirmed cases in Morocco from March 2nd to April 9, 2020, we determined the basic and control reproduction numbers and we estimated the model parameter values. Furthermore, simulations of different scenarios of containment are performed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Results: Epidemic characteristics are predicted according to different rates of containment. The basic reproduction number is estimated to be 2.9949, with CI(2.6729-3.1485). Furthermore, a threshold value of containment rate, below which the epidemic duration is postponed, is determined.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion: Our findings show that the basic reproduction number reflects a high speed of spread of the epidemic. Furthermore, the compulsory containment can be efficient if more than 73% of population are confined. However, even with 90% of containment, the end-time is estimated to happen on July 4th which can be harmful and lead to consequent social-economic damages. Thus, containment need to be accompanied by other measures such as mass testing to reduce the size of asymptomatic population. Indeed, our sensitivity analysis investigation shows that the COVID-19 dynamics depends strongly on the asymptomatic duration as well as the contact and containment rates. Our results can help the Moroccan government to anticipate the spread of COVID-19 and avoid human loses and consequent social-economic damages as well.\n",

      "Paper Abstract: As the Coronavirus contagion develops, it is increasingly important to understand the dynamics of the disease. Its severity is best described by two parameters: its ability to spread and its lethality. Here, we combine a mathematical model with a cohort analysis approach to determine the range of case fatality rates (CFR). We use a logistical function to describe the exponential growth and subsequent flattening of COVID-19 CFR that depends on three parameters: the final CFR (L), the CFR growth rate (k), and the onset-to-death interval (t0). Using the logistic model with specific parameters (L, k and t0), we calculate the number of deaths each day for each cohort. We build an objective function that minimizes the root mean square error between the actual and predicted values of cumulative deaths and run multiple simulations by altering the three parameters. Using all of these values, we find out which set of parameters returns the lowest error when compared to the number of actual deaths. We were able to predict the CFR much closer to reality at all stages of the viral outbreak compared to traditional methods. This model can be used far more effectively than current models to estimate the CFR during an outbreak, allowing for better planning. The model can also help us better understand the impact of individual interventions on the CFR. With much better data collection and labeling, we should be able to improve our predictive power even further.\n",

      "Paper Abstract: Starting from the city of Wuhan in China in late December 2019, the pandemic quickly spread to the rest of the world along the main intercontinental air routes. At the time of writing this article, there are officially about five million infections and more than 300 000 deaths. Statistics vary widely from country to country, revealing significant differences in anticipation and management of the crisis. We propose to examine the COVID-19 epidemic in Tunisia through mathematical models, which aim to determine the actual number of infected cases and to predict the course of the epidemic. As of May 11, 2020, there are officially 1032 COVID-19 infected cases in Tunisia. 45 people have died. Using a mathematical model based on the number of reported infected cases, the number of deaths, and the effect of the 18-day delay between infection and death, this study estimates the actual number of COVID-19 cases in Tunisia as 2555 cases. This paper analyses the evolution of the epidemic in Tunisia using population dynamics with an SEIR model combining susceptible cases S(t), asymptomatic infected cases A(t), reported infected cases V(t), and unreported infected cases U(t). This work measures the basic reproduction number [Formula], which is the average number of people infected by a COVID-19 infected person. The model predicts an [Formula]. Strict containment measures have led to a significant reduction in the reproduction rate. Contact tracing and respect for isolation have an impact: at the current time, we compute that Tunisia has an [Formula] (95% CI 0.14-0.70). These values depend on physical separation and can vary over time depending on the management of suspicious cases. Their objective estimation and the study of their evolution are however necessary to understand the pandemic and to reduce their unintended damage (due to an absence of symptoms, or the confusion of certain symptoms with less contagious diseases, or unavailable or unreliable tests).\n",

      "Paper Abstract: An epidemic disease caused by a new coronavirus has spread in Northern Italy with a strong contagion rate. We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 24, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view of the lack of suitable data and uncertainty of the different parameters, namely, the variation of the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time, the number of initially exposed individuals and infected people, the incubation and infectious periods and the fatality rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we perform an analysis of the results of the model, by varying the parameters and initial conditions (in order the epidemic to start, there should be at least one exposed or one infectious human). Then, we consider the Lombardy case and calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (April 28, 2020) and constraint the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (March 31) approximately, when there is a rapid decrease, with a reproduction ratio R0 = 3 initially, 1.36 at day 22 and 0.78 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death toll is almost 15325 casualties, with 2.64 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit of the dead individuals is 4.25 days and the infectious period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57 %, and 2.36 % if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initially exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47 %. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infectious periods, we observe that a higher incubation period (13 versus 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 % versus 0.57 %), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case. Other choices of the set of parameters also provide a good fit of the data, but some of the results may not be realistic. Therefore, an accurate determination of the fatality rate and characteristics of the epidemic is subject to the knowledge of precise bounds of the parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the specific example, the analysis proposed in this work shows how isolation measures, social distancing and knowledge of the diffusion conditions help us to understand the dynamics of the epidemic. Hence, the importance to quantify the process to verify the effectiveness of the lockdown.\n",

      "Paper Abstract: The global pandemic due to the emergence of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a threat to the future health of humanity. There remains an urgent need to understand its transmission characteristics and design effective interventions to mitigate its spread. In this study, we define a non-linear (known in biochemistry models as allosteric or cooperative) relationship between viral shedding, viral dose and COVID-19 infection propagation. We develop a mathematical model of the dynamics of COVID-19 to link quantitative features of viral shedding, human exposure and transmission in nine countries impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The model was then used to evaluate the efficacy of interventions against virus transmission. We found that cooperativity was important to capture country-specific transmission dynamics and leads to resistance to mitigating transmission in mild or moderate interventions. The behaviors of the model emphasize that strict interventions greatly limiting both virus shedding and human exposure are indispensable to achieving effective containment of COVID-19.\n",

The Indian public health care system is already overstretched, and this pandemic is making things even worse. That is why forecasting cases for India is necessary to meet the future demands of the health infrastructure caused due to COVID-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "Objective: Our study forecasts the confirmed and active cases for COVID-19 until July mid, using time series Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. Additionally, we estimated the number of isolation beds, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds and ventilators required for the growing number of COVID-19 patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods: We used ARIMA model for forecasting confirmed and active cases till the 15th July. We used time-series data of COVID-19 cases in India from 14th March to 22nd May. We estimated the requirements for ICU beds as 10%, ventilators as 5% and isolation beds as 85% of the active cases forecasted using the ARIMA model.\n",

      "Results: Our forecasts indicate that India will have an estimated 7,47,772 confirmed cases (95% CI: 493943, 1001601) and 296,472 active cases (95% CI:196820, 396125) by 15th July. While Maharashtra will be the most affected state, having the highest number of active and confirmed cases, Punjab is expected to have an estimated 115 active cases by 15th July. India needs to prepare 2,52,001 isolation beds (95% CI: 167297, 336706), 29,647 ICU beds (95% CI: 19682, 39612), and 14,824 ventilator beds (95% CI: 9841, 19806).\n",

      "Conclusion: Our forecasts show an alarming situation for India, and Maharashtra in particular. The actual numbers can go higher than our estimated numbers as India has a limited testing facility and coverage.\n",

      "Paper Abstract: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a highly infectious disease, was first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease has spread to 212 countries and territories around the world and infected (confirmed) more than three million people. In India, the disease was first detected on 30 January 2020 in Kerala in a student who returned from Wuhan. The total (cumulative) number of confirmed infected people is more than 37000 till now across India (3 May 2020). Most of the research and newspaper articles focus on the number of infected people in the entire country. However, given the size and diversity of India, it may be a good idea to look at the spread of the disease in each state separately, along with the entire country. For example, currently, Maharashtra has more than 10000 confirmed cumulative infected cases, whereas West Bengal has less than 800 confirmed infected cases (1 May 2020). The approaches to address the pandemic in the two states must be different due to limited resources. In this article, we will focus the infected people in each state (restricting to only those states with enough data for prediction) and build three growth models to predict infected people for that state in the next 30 days. The impact of preventive measures on daily infected-rate is discussed for each state.\n",

      "C_LIO_LIWe expect DIR to be zero or negative to conclude that COVID-19 is not spreading in a state. Even a small positive DIR (say 0.01) indicates virus is spreading in the community. The virus can potentially increase the DIR anytime.\n",
      "C_LIO_LISevere: The states without a decreasing trend in DIR and near exponential growth in active infected cases are Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal.\n",

      "C_LIO_LIStates with non-decreasing DIR need to do much more in terms of the preventive measures immediately to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, the states with decreasing DIR can maintain the same status to see the DIR become zero or negative for consecutive 14 days to be able to declare the end of the pandemic.\n",

      "Paper Abstract: Since the detection of first case of COVID-19 in Chile on March 3rd, 2020, a total of 301019 cases including 6434 deaths have been reported in Chile as of July 7th, 2020. In this manuscript we estimate the reproduction number during the early transmission phase in Chile and study the effectiveness of control interventions by conducting short-term forecasts based on the early transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We also estimate the reproduction number and conduct short term forecasts for the most recent developments in the epidemic trajectory of COVID-19 in Chile (May 9th-July 7th, 2020) to study the effectiveness of re-imposition of lockdowns in the country. The incidence curve in Chile displays early sub-exponential growth dynamics with the scaling of growth parameter, p, estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8) and the reproduction number, estimated at 1.8 (95% CI: 1.6, 1.9). Our analysis emphasizes that the control measures at the start of the epidemic significantly slowed down the spread of the virus. However, easing of the COVID-19 restrictions and spread of virus to the low income neighborhoods in May led to a new wave of infections, followed by the re-imposition of lockdowns in Santiago and other municipalities. These measures have decelerated the virus spread with R estimated at ~0.87(95% CI: 0.84, 0.89) as of July 7th, 2020. Our current findings point that the sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Chile is being brought under control. The COVID-19 epidemic followed an early sub-exponential growth trend (p ~0.8) that transformed into a linear growth trend (p ~0.5) as of July 7th, 2020. While the broad scale social distancing interventions have slowed the virus spread, the number of new COVID-19 cases continue to accrue, underscoring the need for persistent social distancing and active case detection and isolation efforts to bring epidemic under control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Author summary: In context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Chile is one of the hardest hit countries in Latin America, struggling to contain the spread of the virus. In this manuscript we employ renewal equation to estimate the reproduction number for the early ascending phase of the COVID-19 epidemic and the most recent time period to guide the magnitude and intensity of the interventions required to combat the COVID-19 epidemic. We also generate short terms forecasts based on the epidemic trajectory using phenomenological models and assess counterfactual scenarios to understand any additional resources required to contain the spread of virus. Our results indicate early sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2. However, the initial control measures at the start of the epidemic significantly slowed down the spread of the virus whose effect is visible two weeks after the implementation of interventions. Easing of the COVID-19 restrictions in May led to a new wave of infections, followed by the re-imposition of lockdowns in Santiago and other municipalities. While the broad scale social distancing interventions have slowed the most recent spread of the virus spread, the number of new COVID-19 cases continue to accrue, underscoring the need for persistent social distancing efforts to bring epidemic under control.\n",

      "Methods: We used a publicly available mobility index from a popular transit application to evaluate the effect of physical distancing on infection growth rates and reproductive numbers in 40 jurisdictions between March 23 and April 12, 2020.\n",

      "Findings: A 10% decrease in mobility was associated with a 14.6% decrease (exp({beta}) = 0{middle dot}854; 95% credible interval: 0{middle dot}835, 0{middle dot}873) in the average daily growth rate and a -0{middle dot}061 (95% CI: -0{middle dot}071, -0{middle dot}052) change in the instantaneous reproductive number two weeks later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interpretation: Our analysis demonstrates that decreases in urban mobility were predictive of declines in epidemic growth. Mobility metrics offer an appealing method to calibrate population-level physical distancing policy and implementation, especially as jurisdictions relax restrictions and consider alternative physical distancing strategies.\n",

      "Research in Context Evidence before this study: Widespread physical distancing interventions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic led to sharp declines in global mobility throughout March 2020. Real-time metrics to evaluate the effects of these measures on future case growth rates will be useful for calibrating further interventions, especially as jurisdictions begin to relax restrictions. We searched PubMed on May 22, 2020 for studies reporting the use of aggregated mobility data to measure the effects of physical distancing on COVID-19 cases, using the keywords \"COVID-19\", \"2019-nCoV\", or \"SARS-CoV-2\" in combination with \"mobility\", \"movement\", \"phone\", \"Google\", or \"Apple\". We scanned 252 published studies and found one that used mobility data to estimate the effects of physical distancing. This study evaluated temporal trends in reported cases in four U.S. metropolitan areas using a metric measuring the percentage of cell phone users leaving their homes. Many published papers examined how national and international travel predicted the spatial distribution of cases (particularly outflow from Wuhan, China), but very little has been published on metrics that could be used as prospective, proximal indicators of future case growth. We also identified a series of reports released by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team and several manuscripts deposited on preprint servers such as medRxiv addressing this topic, demonstrating this is an active area of research.\n",
      "\n",
      "Added value of this study: We demonstrate that changes in a publicly available urban mobility index reported in over 40 global cities were associated with COVID-19 case growth rates and estimated reproductive numbers two to three weeks later. These cities, spread over 5 continents, include many regional epicenters of COVID-19 outbreaks. This is one of only a few studies using a mobility metric applicable to future growth rates that is both publicly available and international in scope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implications of all the available evidence: Restrictions on human mobility have proved effective for controlling COVID-19 in China and the rest of the world. However, such drastic public health measures cannot be sustained indefinitely and are currently being relaxed in many jurisdictions. Publicly available mobility metrics offer a method of estimating the effects of changes in mobility before they are reflected in the trajectory of COVID-19 case growth rates and thus merit further evaluation.\n",
